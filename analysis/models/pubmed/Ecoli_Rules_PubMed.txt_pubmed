Escherichia coli AraC is a well-described transcription activator of genes 
involved in arabinose metabolism. Using complementary genomic approaches, 
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip, and transcription profiling, we 
identify direct regulatory targets of AraC, including five novel target genes: 
ytfQ, ydeN, ydeM, ygeA, and polB. Strikingly, only ytfQ has an established 
connection to arabinose metabolism, suggesting that AraC has a broader function 
than previously described. We demonstrate arabinose-dependent repression of 
ydeNM by AraC, in contrast to the well-described arabinose-dependent activation 
of other target genes. We also demonstrate unexpected read-through of 
transcription at the Rho-independent terminators downstream of araD and araE, 
leading to significant increases in the expression of polB and ygeA, 
respectively. AraC is highly conserved in the related species Salmonella 
enterica. We use ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to map 
the AraC regulon in S. enterica. A comparison of the E. coli and S. enterica 
AraC regulons, coupled with a bioinformatic analysis of other related species, 
reveals a conserved regulatory network across the family Enterobacteriaceae 
comprised of 10 genes associated with arabinose transport and metabolism.

A plasmid with the galK gene under control of the promoter of the mannitol 
utilization genes (mtl) from Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 50106 was constructed 
to isolate the mtl regulatory gene. An Escherichia coli galK- mtl- strain with 
this plasmid was used to screen a genomic library of P. fluorescens for the 
presence of the regulatory gene by plating on McConkey agar plates supplemented 
with galactose and mannitol. Clones carrying the regulatory gene were isolated 
and by complemention assays, deletion analysis and DNA sequencing an open 
reading frame (mtlR) of 906nt identified encoding the regulator. The deduced 
protein MtlR with a calculated molecular mass of 34.7kDa showed a low overall 
similarity to several other regulatory proteins of the XylS/AraC family. When 
mtlR was cloned and expressed in E. coli, the protein was produced as inclusion 
bodies. Complete denaturation followed by subsequent slow refolding led to low 
amounts of active protein. The activity was shown in gel mobility shift assays 
by binding of MtlR to a DNA fragment containing the promoter/operator region of 
the P. fluorescens mtl genes.

Illinois, Chicago 60680.

The Escherichia coli araFGH operon codes for proteins involved in the 
L-arabinose high-affinity transport system. Transcriptional regulation of the 
operon was studied by creating point mutations and deletions in the control 
region cloned into a GalK expression vector. The transcription start site was 
confirmed by RNA sequencing of transcripts. The sequences essential for 
polymerase function were localized by deletions and point mutations. 
Surprisingly, only a weak -10 consensus sequence, and no -35 sequence is 
required. Mutation of a guanosine at position -12 greatly reduced promoter 
activity, which suggests important polymerase interactions with DNA between the 
usual -10 and -35 positions. A double mutation toward the consensus in the -10 
region was required to create a promoter capable of significant AraC-independent 
transcription. These results show that the araFGH promoter structure is similar 
to that of the galP1 promoter and is substantially different from that of the 
araBAD promoter. The effects of 11 mutations within the DNA region thought to 
bind the cyclic AMP receptor protein correlate well with the CRP consensus 
binding sequence and confirm that this region is responsible for cyclic AMP 
regulation. Deletion of the AraC binding site nearest the promoter, araFG1, 
eliminates arabinose regulation, whereas deletion of the upstream AraC binding 
site, araFG2, has only a slight effect on promoter activity.

Defining a rob regulon in Escherichia coli by using transposon mutagenesis.

The Rob protein of Escherichia coli is a member of the AraC-XylS family of 
prokaryotic transcriptional regulators and is expressed constitutively. Deletion 
of the rob gene increases susceptibility to organic solvents, while 
overexpression of Rob increases tolerance to organic solvents and resistance to 
a variety of antibiotics and to the superoxide-generating compound phenazine 
methosulfate. To determine whether constitutive levels of Rob regulate basal 
gene expression, we performed a MudJ transposon screen in a rob deletion mutant 
containing a plasmid that allows for controlled rob gene expression. We 
identified eight genes and confirmed that seven are transcriptionally activated 
by normal expression of Rob from the chromosomal rob gene (inaA, marR, aslB, 
ybaO, mdlA, yfhD, and ybiS). One gene, galT, was repressed by Rob. We also 
demonstrated by Northern analysis that basal expression of micF is significantly 
higher in wild-type E. coli than in a rob deletion mutant. Rob binding to the 
promoter regions of most of these genes was substantiated in electrophoretic 
mobility shift assays. However, Mu insertions in individual Rob-regulated genes 
did not affect solvent sensitivity. This phenotype may depend on changes in the 
expression of several of these Rob-regulated genes or on other genes that were 
not identified. Rob clearly affects the basal expression of genes with a broad 
range of functions, including antibiotic resistance, acid adaptation, carbon 
metabolism, cell wall synthesis, central intermediary metabolism, and transport. 
The magnitudes of Rob's effects are modest, however, and the protein may thus 
play a role as a general transcription cofactor.

YqhC regulates transcription of the adjacent Escherichia coli genes yqhD and

Previous results have demonstrated that the silencing of adjacent genes encoding 
NADPH-dependent furfural oxidoreductases (yqhD dkgA) is responsible for 
increased furfural tolerance in an E. coli strain EMFR9 [Miller et al., Appl 
Environ Microbiol 75:4315-4323, 2009]. This gene silencing is now reported to 
result from the spontaneous insertion of an IS10 into the coding region of yqhC, 
an upstream gene. YqhC shares homology with transcriptional regulators belonging 
to the AraC/XylS family and was shown to act as a positive regulator of the 
adjacent operon encoding YqhD and DkgA. Regulation was demonstrated by 
constructing a chromosomal deletion of yqhC, a firefly luciferase reporter 
plasmid for yqhC, and by a direct comparison of furfural resistance and 
NADPH-dependent furfural reductase activity. Closely related bacteria contain 
yqhC, yqhD, and dkgA orthologs in the same arrangement as in E. coli LY180. 
Orthologs of yqhC are also present in more distantly related Gram-negative 
bacteria. Disruption of yqhC offers a useful approach to increase furfural 
tolerance in bacteria.

Transcriptional activation of the aldehyde reductase YqhD by YqhC and its

The reactive alpha-oxoaldehydes such as glyoxal (GO) and methylglyoxal (MG) are 
generated in vivo from sugars through oxidative stress. GO and MG are believed 
to be removed from cells by glutathione-dependent glyoxalases and other aldehyde 
reductases. We isolated a number of GO-resistant (GO(r)) mutants from 
Escherichia coli strain MG1655 on LB plates containing 10 mM GO. By tagging the 
mutations with the transposon TnphoA-132 and determining their cotransductional 
linkages, we were able to identify a locus to which most of the GO(r) mutations 
were mapped. DNA sequencing of the locus revealed that it contains the yqhC 
gene, which is predicted to encode an AraC-type transcriptional regulator of 
unknown function. The GO(r) mutations we identified result in missense changes 
in yqhC and were concentrated in the predicted regulatory domain of the protein, 
thereby constitutively activating the product of the adjacent gene yqhD. The 
transcriptional activation of yqhD by wild-type YqhC and its mutant forms was 
established by an assay with a beta-galactosidase reporter fusion, as well as 
with real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. We demonstrated that YqhC 
binds to the promoter region of yqhD and that this binding is abolished by a 
mutation in the potential target site, which is similar to the consensus 
sequence of its homolog SoxS. YqhD facilitates the removal of GO through its 
NADPH-dependent enzymatic reduction activity by converting it to ethadiol via 
glycolaldehyde, as detected by nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as by 
spectroscopic measurements. Therefore, we propose that YqhC is a transcriptional 
activator of YqhD, which acts as an aldehyde reductase with specificity for 
certain aldehydes, including GO.

Transcription-generated DNA supercoiling plays a decisive role in a promoter 
relay mechanism for the coordinated expression of genes in the Salmonella 
typhimurium ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster. A similar mechanism also operates 
to control expression of the genes in the Escherichia coli ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD 
gene cluster. However, the mechanism underlying the DNA supercoiling effect 
remained elusive. A bacterial gene silencer AT8 was found to be important for 
the repression state of the leuO gene as part of the promoter relay mechanism. 
In this communication, we demonstrated that the gene silencer AT8 is a 
nucleation site for recruiting histone-like nucleoid structuring protein to form 
a cis-spreading nucleoprotein filament that is responsible for silencing of the 
leuO gene. With a DNA geometric similarity rather than a DNA sequence 
specificity, the E. coli gene silencer EAT6 was capable of replacing the 
histone-like nucleoid structuring protein nucleation function of the S. 
typhimurium gene silencer AT8 for the leuO gene silencing. The 
interchangeability between DNA geometrical elements for supporting the silencing 
activity in the region is consistent with a previous finding that a neighboring 
transcription activity determines the outcome of the gene silencing activity. 
The geometric requirement, which was revealed for this silencing activity, 
explains the decisive role of transcription-generated DNA supercoiling found in 
the promoter relay mechanism.

Lipoic acid is a covalently-bound enzyme cofactor required for central 
metabolism all three domains of life. In the last 20 years the pathway of lipoic 
acid synthesis and metabolism has been established in Escherichia coli. 
Expression of the genes of the lipoic acid biosynthesis pathway was believed to 
be constitutive. However, in 2010 Kaleta and coworkers (BMC Syst. Biol. 4:116) 
predicted a binding site for the pyruvate dehydrogenase operon repressor, PdhR 
(referred to lipA site 1) upstream of lipA, the gene encoding lipoic acid 
synthase and concluded that PdhR regulates lipA transcription. We report in vivo 
and in vitro evidence that lipA is not controlled by PdhR and that the putative 
regulatory site deduced by the prior workers is nonfunctional and 
physiologically irrelevant. E. coli PdhR was purified to homogeneity and used 
for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The lipA site 1 of Kaleta and 
coworkers failed to bind PdhR. The binding detected by these workers is due to 
another site (lipA site 3) located far upstream of the lipA promoter. Relative 
to the canonical PdhR binding site lipA site 3 is a half-palindrome and as 
expected had only weak PdhR binding ability. Manipulation of lipA site 3 to 
construct a palindrome gave significantly enhanced PdhR binding affinity. The 
native lipA promoter and the version carrying the artificial lipA3 palindrome 
were transcriptionally fused to a LacZ reporter gene to directly assay lipA 
expression. Deletion of pdhR gave no significant change in lipA promoter-driven 
β-galactosidase activity with either the native or constructed palindrome 
upstream sequences, indicating that PdhR plays no physiological role in 
regulation of lipA expression.

BACKGROUND: Although Escherichia coli is one of the best studied model 
organisms, a comprehensive understanding of its gene regulation is not yet 
achieved. There exist many approaches to reconstruct regulatory interaction 
networks from gene expression experiments. Mutual information based approaches 
are most useful for large-scale network inference.
RESULTS: We used a three-step approach in which we combined gene regulatory 
network inference based on directed information (DTI) and sequence analysis. DTI 
values were calculated on a set of gene expression profiles from 19 time course 
experiments extracted from the Many Microbes Microarray Database. Focusing on 
influences between pairs of genes in which one partner encodes a transcription 
factor (TF) we derived a network which contains 878 TF - gene interactions of 
which 166 are known according to RegulonDB. Afterward, we selected a subset of 
109 interactions that could be confirmed by the presence of a phylogenetically 
conserved binding site of the respective regulator. By this second step, the 
fraction of known interactions increased from 19% to 60%. In the last step, we 
checked the 44 of the 109 interactions not yet included in RegulonDB for 
functional relationships between the regulator and the target and, thus, 
obtained ten TF - target gene interactions. Five of them concern the regulator 
LexA and have already been reported in the literature. The remaining five 
influences describe regulations by Fis (with two novel targets), PhdR, PhoP, and 
KdgR. For the validation of our approach, one of them, the regulation of lipoate 
synthase (LipA) by the pyruvate-sensing pyruvate dehydrogenate repressor (PdhR), 
was experimentally checked and confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS: We predicted a set of five novel TF - target gene interactions in 
E. coli. One of them, the regulation of lipA by the transcriptional regulator 
PdhR was validated experimentally. Furthermore, we developed DTInfer, a new 
R-package for the inference of gene-regulatory networks from microarrays using 
directed information.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

The sigmaE-mediated response to extracytoplasmic stress in Escherichia coli is

The extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli is controlled by the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma(E). sigma(E) activity is uniquely induced by the 
accumulation of outer membrane protein precursors in the periplasmic space, and 
leads to the increased production of several proteins, including the periplasmic 
protease DegP, that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular 
integrity under stress conditions. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that 
sigma(E) activity is under the control of three genes, rseABC (for regulator of 
sigma E), encoded immediately downstream of the sigma factor. Deletion of rseA 
leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity. RseA is predicted to be an 
inner membrane protein, and the purified cytoplasmic domain binds to and 
inhibits sigma(E)-directed transcription in vitro, indicating that RseA acts as 
an anti-sigma factor. Deletion of rseB leads to a slight induction of sigma(E), 
indicating that RseB is also a negative regulator of sigma(E). RseB is a 
periplasmic protein and was found to co-purify with the periplasmic domain of 
RseA, indicating that RseB probably exerts negative activity on sigma(E) through 
RseA. Deletion of rseC, in contrast, has no effect on sigma(E) activity under 
steady-state conditions. Under induction conditions, strains lacking RseB and/or 
C show wild-type induction of sigma(E) activity, indicating either the presence 
of multiple pathways regulating sigma(E) activity, or the ability of RseA alone 
to both sense and transmit information to sigma(E).

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

The sigmaE-mediated response to extracytoplasmic stress in Escherichia coli is 
transduced by RseA and RseB, two negative regulators of sigmaE.

The extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli is controlled by the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma(E). sigma(E) activity is uniquely induced by the 
accumulation of outer membrane protein precursors in the periplasmic space, and 
leads to the increased production of several proteins, including the periplasmic 
protease DegP, that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular 
integrity under stress conditions. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that 
sigma(E) activity is under the control of three genes, rseABC (for regulator of 
sigma E), encoded immediately downstream of the sigma factor. Deletion of rseA 
leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity. RseA is predicted to be an 
inner membrane protein, and the purified cytoplasmic domain binds to and 
inhibits sigma(E)-directed transcription in vitro, indicating that RseA acts as 
an anti-sigma factor. Deletion of rseB leads to a slight induction of sigma(E), 
indicating that RseB is also a negative regulator of sigma(E). RseB is a 
periplasmic protein and was found to co-purify with the periplasmic domain of 
RseA, indicating that RseB probably exerts negative activity on sigma(E) through 
RseA. Deletion of rseC, in contrast, has no effect on sigma(E) activity under 
steady-state conditions. Under induction conditions, strains lacking RseB and/or 
C show wild-type induction of sigma(E) activity, indicating either the presence 
of multiple pathways regulating sigma(E) activity, or the ability of RseA alone 
to both sense and transmit information to sigma(E).

Cefalexin is a widely used first-generation cephalosporin, and resistance in 
Escherichia coli is caused by extended-spectrum (e.g., CTX-M) and AmpC 
β-lactamase production and therefore frequently coincides with third-generation 
cephalosporin resistance. However, we have recently identified large numbers of 
E. coli isolates from human infections, and from cattle, where cefalexin 
resistance is not β-lactamase mediated. Here, we show, by studying 
laboratory-selected mutants, clinical isolates, and isolates from cattle, that 
OmpF porin disruption or downregulation is a major cause of cefalexin resistance 
in E. coli. Importantly, we identify multiple regulatory mutations that cause 
OmpF downregulation. In addition to mutation of ompR, already known to 
downregulate OmpF and OmpC porin production, we find that rseA mutation, which 
strongly activates the sigma E regulon, greatly increases DegP production, which 
degrades OmpF, OmpC, and OmpA. Furthermore, we reveal that mutations affecting 
lipopolysaccharide structure, exemplified by the loss of GmhB, essential for 
lipopolysaccharide heptosylation, also modestly activate DegP production, 
resulting in OmpF degradation. Remarkably, given the critical importance 
attached to such systems for normal E. coli physiology, we find evidence for 
DegP-mediated OmpF downregulation and gmhB and rseA loss-of-function mutation in 
E. coli isolates derived from human infections. Finally, we show that these 
regulatory mutations enhance the ability of group 1 CTX-M β-lactamase to confer 
reduced carbapenem susceptibility, particularly those mutations that cause OmpC 
in addition to OmpF downregulation.

In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic protease DegP plays a critical role in 
degrading misfolded outer membrane proteins (OMPs). Consequently, mutants 
lacking DegP display a temperature-sensitive growth defect, presumably due to 
the toxic accumulation of misfolded OMPs. The Tol-Pal complex plays a poorly 
defined but an important role in envelope biogenesis, since mutants defective in 
this complex display a classical periplasmic leakage phenotype. Double mutants 
lacking DegP and an intact Tol-Pal complex display exaggerated 
temperature-sensitive growth defects and the leaky phenotype. Two revertants 
that overcome the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype carry missense 
mutations in the degS gene, resulting in D102V and D320A substitutions. D320 and 
E317 of the PDZ domain of DegS make salt bridges with R178 of DegS's protease 
domain to keep the protease in the inactive state. However, weakening of the 
tripartite interactions by D320A increases DegS's basal protease activity. 
Although the D102V substitution is as effective as D320A in suppressing the 
temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, the molecular mechanism behind its 
effect on DegS's protease activity is unclear. Our data suggest that the two 
DegS variants modestly activate RseA-controlled, σE-mediated envelope stress 
response pathway and elevate periplasmic protease activity to restore envelope 
homeostasis. Based on the release of a cytoplasmic enzyme in the culture 
supernatant, we conclude that the conditional lethal phenotype of ΔtolB ΔdegP 
mutants stems from a grossly destabilized envelope structure that causes 
excessive cell lysis. Together, the data point to a critical role for 
periplasmic proteases when the Tol-Pal complex-mediated envelope structure 
and/or functions are compromised.IMPORTANCE The Tol-Pal complex plays a poorly 
defined role in envelope biogenesis. The data presented here show that DegP's 
periplasmic protease activity becomes crucial in mutants lacking the intact 
Tol-Pal complex, but this requirement can be circumvented by suppressor 
mutations that activate the basal protease activity of a regulatory protease, 
DegS. These observations point to a critical role for periplasmic proteases when 
Tol-Pal-mediated envelope structure and/or functions are perturbed.

Reversal of the ΔdegP phenotypes by a novel rpoE allele of Escherichia coli.

RseA sequesters RpoE (σ(E)) to the inner membrane of Escherichia coli when 
envelope stress is low. Elevated envelope stress triggers RseA cleavage by the 
sequential action of two membrane proteases, DegS and RseP, releasing σ(E) to 
activate an envelope stress reducing pathway. Revertants of a ΔdegP ΔbamB 
strain, which fails to grow at 37°C due to high envelope stress, harbored 
mutations in the rseA and rpoE genes. Null and missense rseA mutations 
constitutively hyper-activated the σ(E) regulon and significantly reduced the 
major outer membrane protein (OMP) levels. In contrast, a novel rpoE allele, 
rpoE3, resulting from the partial duplication of the rpoE gene, increased σ(E) 
levels greater than that seen in the rseA mutant background but did not reduce 
OMP levels. A σ(E)-dependent RybB::LacZ construct showed only a weak activation 
of the σ(E) pathway by rpoE3. Despite this, rpoE3 fully reversed the growth and 
envelope vesiculation phenotypes of ΔdegP. Interestingly, rpoE3 also brought 
down the modestly activated Cpx envelope stress pathway in the ΔdegP strain to 
the wild type level, showing the complementary nature of the σ(E) and Cpx 
pathways. Through employing a labile mutant periplasmic protein, AcrA(L222Q), it 
was determined that the rpoE3 mutation overcomes the ΔdegP phenotypes, in part, 
by activating a σ(E)-dependent proteolytic pathway. Our data suggest that a 
reduction in the OMP levels is not intrinsic to the σ(E)-mediated mechanism of 
lowering envelope stress. They also suggest that under extreme envelope stress, 
a tight homeostasis loop between RseA and σ(E) may partly be responsible for 
cell death, and this loop can be broken by mutations that either lower RseA 
activity or increase σ(E) levels.

The PDZ protease DegS senses mislocalized outer membrane proteins and initiates 
the sigmaE pathway in the bacterial periplasm. This unfolded protein response 
pathway is activated by processing of the anti-sigma factor RseA by DegS and 
other proteases acting downstream of DegS. DegS mediates the rate-limiting step 
of sigma E induction and its activity must be highly specific and tightly 
regulated. While DegS is structurally and biochemically well studied, the 
determinants of its pronounced substrate specificity are unknown. We therefore 
performed swapping experiments by introducing elements of the homologous but 
unspecific PDZ protease DegP. Introduction of loop L2 of DegP into DegS 
converted the enzyme into a non-specific protease, while swapping of PDZ domains 
did not. Therefore, loop L2 of the protease domain is a key determinant of 
substrate specificity. Interestingly, swapping of loop L2 did not affect the 
tight regulation of DegS. In addition, the combined introduction of loop L2 and 
PDZ domain 1 of DegP into DegS converted DegS even further into a DegP-like 
protease. These and other data suggest that homologous enzymes with distinct 
activities and regulatory features can be converted by simple genetic 
modifications.

Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is a method for transducing signals between 
cellular compartments. When protein folding is compromised in the periplasm of 
E. coli, the C termini of outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) bind to the PDZ domains 
of the trimeric DegS protease and activate cleavage of RseA, a transmembrane 
transcriptional regulator. We show here that DegS is an allosteric enzyme. OMP 
binding shifts the equilibrium from a nonfunctional state, in which the active 
sites are unreactive, to the functional proteolytic conformation. 
Crystallographic, biochemical, and mutagenic experiments show that the 
unliganded PDZ domains are inhibitory and suggest that OMP binding per se is 
sufficient to stabilize the relaxed conformation and activate DegS. OMP-induced 
activation and RseA binding are both positively cooperative, allowing 
switch-like behavior of the OMP-DegS-RseA system. Residues involved in the DegS 
allosteric switch are conserved in the DegP/HtrA and HtrA2/Omi families, 
suggesting that many PDZ proteases use a common mechanism of allosteric 
activation.

    Cell. 2003 Apr 4;113(1):1-2.

Transmembrane signaling between intracellular compartments is often controlled 
by regulated proteolysis. Escherichia coli respond to misfolded or unfolded 
outer-membrane porins (OMPs) in the periplasm by inducing sigma(E)-dependent 
transcription of stress genes in the cytoplasm. This process requires a 
proteolytic cascade initiated by the DegS protease, which destroys a 
transmembrane protein (RseA) that normally binds to and inhibits sigma(E). Here, 
we show that peptides ending with OMP-like C-terminal sequences bind the DegS 
PDZ domain, activate DegS cleavage of RseA, and induce sigma(E)-dependent 
transcription. These results suggest that DegS acts as a sensor of envelope 
stress by binding unassembled OMPs. DegS activation involves relief of 
inhibitory interactions between its PDZ and protease domains. Peptide binding to 
inhibitory PDZ domains in proteases related to DegS, including DegP/HtrA, may 
also regulate the degradation of specific substrates by these enzymes.

degS (hhoB) is an essential Escherichia coli gene whose indispensable function

Francisco, California 94143, USA.

DegS (HhoB), a putative serine protease related to DegP/HtrA, regulates the 
basal and induced activity of the essential Escherichia coli sigma factor sigma 
(E), which is involved in the cellular response to extracytoplasmic stress. DegS 
promotes the destabilization of the sigma (E)-specific anti-sigma factor RseA, 
thereby releasing sigma (E) to direct gene expression. We demonstrate that degS 
is an essential E. coli gene and show that the essential function of DegS is to 
provide the cell with sigma (E) activity. We also show that the putative active 
site of DegS is periplasmic and that DegS requires its N-terminal transmembrane 
domain for its sigma (E)-related function.

Hyperosmotic shock induces the sigma32 and sigmaE stress regulons of Escherichia 
coli.

Bianchi AA(1), Baneyx F.

The rise in the levels of sigmaS that accompanies hyperosmotic shock plays an 
important role in Escherichia coli survival by increasing the transcription of 
genes involved in the synthesis and transport of osmoprotectants. To determine 
if other stress regulons collaborate with sigmaS in dealing with high 
osmolality, we used single copy fusions of lacZ to representative promoters 
induced by protein misfolding in the cytoplasm (dnaK and ibp ), extracytoplasmic 
stress [P3rpoH and htrA(degP )] and cold shock (cspA). Both the 
sigma32-dependent, dnaK and ibp, promoters, and the sigmaE-dependent, P3rpoH and 
htrA, promoters were rapidly but transiently induced when mid-exponential phase 
cells were treated with 0.464 M sucrose. The cspA promoter, however, did not 
respond to the same treatment. Overproduction of the cytoplasmic domain of the 
sigmaE anti-sigma factor, RseA, reduced the magnitude of osmotic induction in 
lambdaphi(P3rpoH:lacZ ) lysogens, but had no effect on the activation of the 
dnaK and ibp promoters. Similarly, induction of the dnaK:lacZ and ibp:lacZ 
fusions was not altered in either rpoS or ompR genetic backgrounds. Osmotic 
upshift led to a twofold increase in the enzymatic activity of the lambdaTLF247 
rpoH:lacZ translational fusion whether or not the cells were treated with 
rifampicin, indicating that both heat shock and exposure to high osmolality 
trigger a transient increase in rpoH translation. Our results suggest that the 
sigma32, sigmaE and sigmaS regulons closely co-operate in the managment of 
hyperosmotic stress. Induction of the sigma32 and sigmaE regulons appears to be 
an emergency response required to repair protein misfolding and facilitate the 
proper folding of proteins that are rapidly synthesized following loss of 
turgor, while providing a mechanism to increase the activity of sigmaS, the 
primary stress factor in osmoadaptation.

HtrA, also known as DegP and probably identical to the Do protease, is a heat 
shock-induced serine protease that is active in the periplasm of Escherichia 
coli. Homologues of HtrA have been described in a wide range of bacteria and in 
eukaryotes. Its chief role is to degrade misfolded proteins in the periplasm. 
Substrate recognition probably involves the recently described PDZ domains in 
the C-terminal half of HtrA and, we suspect, has much in common with the 
substrate recognition system of the tail-specific protease, Prc (which also 
possesses a PDZ domain). The expression of htrA is regulated by a complex set of 
signal transduction pathways, which includes an alternative sigma factor, RpoE, 
an anti-sigma factor, RseA, a two-component regulatory system, CpxRA, and two 
phosphoprotein phosphatases, PrpA and PrpB. Mutations in the htrA genes of 
Salmonella, Brucella and Yersinia cause decreased survival in mice and/or 
macrophages, and htrA mutants can act as vaccines, as cloning hosts and as 
carriers of heterologous antigens.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

Reversal of the ΔdegP phenotypes by a novel rpoE allele of Escherichia coli.

RseA sequesters RpoE (σ(E)) to the inner membrane of Escherichia coli when 
envelope stress is low. Elevated envelope stress triggers RseA cleavage by the 
sequential action of two membrane proteases, DegS and RseP, releasing σ(E) to 
activate an envelope stress reducing pathway. Revertants of a ΔdegP ΔbamB 
strain, which fails to grow at 37°C due to high envelope stress, harbored 
mutations in the rseA and rpoE genes. Null and missense rseA mutations 
constitutively hyper-activated the σ(E) regulon and significantly reduced the 
major outer membrane protein (OMP) levels. In contrast, a novel rpoE allele, 
rpoE3, resulting from the partial duplication of the rpoE gene, increased σ(E) 
levels greater than that seen in the rseA mutant background but did not reduce 
OMP levels. A σ(E)-dependent RybB::LacZ construct showed only a weak activation 
of the σ(E) pathway by rpoE3. Despite this, rpoE3 fully reversed the growth and 
envelope vesiculation phenotypes of ΔdegP. Interestingly, rpoE3 also brought 
down the modestly activated Cpx envelope stress pathway in the ΔdegP strain to 
the wild type level, showing the complementary nature of the σ(E) and Cpx 
pathways. Through employing a labile mutant periplasmic protein, AcrA(L222Q), it 
was determined that the rpoE3 mutation overcomes the ΔdegP phenotypes, in part, 
by activating a σ(E)-dependent proteolytic pathway. Our data suggest that a 
reduction in the OMP levels is not intrinsic to the σ(E)-mediated mechanism of 
lowering envelope stress. They also suggest that under extreme envelope stress, 
a tight homeostasis loop between RseA and σ(E) may partly be responsible for 
cell death, and this loop can be broken by mutations that either lower RseA 
activity or increase σ(E) levels.

Suppression by enhanced RpoE activity of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of 
a degP ssrA double mutant in Escherichia coli.

SsrA is a small RNA playing a crucial role in trans-translation, which leads to 
rescue of stalled ribosomes on or at the end of mRNA and addition of the 
degradation tag to a growing polypeptide. The lack of SsrA has been shown to 
enhance the temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype of an E. coli strain defective 
in the degP gene, which encodes one of the periplasmic proteases. This severe ts 
phenotype was relieved only partially by an SsrADD variant, which can lead to 
ribosome rescue but adds a protease-resistant tag instead of the degradation 
tag, suggesting that accumulation of polypeptides programmed by truncated mRNAs 
is responsible for growth defect of the ssrA degP mutant. Expression of an 
S210A-mutant DegP protein, which lacks the protease activity but retains the 
chaperone activity, could relieve the ts phenotype of the double mutant, 
suggesting that the chaperone activity but not the protease activity of DegP is 
required for growth of the ssrA-deficient cells at high temperature. 
Overexpression of the rpoE gene, which encodes sigmaE responsible for the 
expression of factors involved in extracellular stress response, also suppressed 
the ts phenotype of the ssrA degP mutant. This suggests that the 
stress-responsing pathway(s) may be involved in the enhancement of ts phenotype 
of degP mutant in the absence of SsrA.

Verapamil, a Ca2+ channel inhibitor acts as a local anesthetic and induces the 
sigma E dependent extra-cytoplasmic stress response in E. coli.

Verapamil is used clinically as a Ca(2+) channel inhibitor for the treatment of 
various disorders such as angina, hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia. Here we 
study the effect of verapamil on the bacterium Escherichia coli. The drug was 
shown to inhibit cell division at growth sub inhibitory concentrations, 
independently of the SOS response. We show verapamil is a membrane active drug, 
with similar effects to dibucaine, a local anesthetic. Thus, both verapamil and 
dibucaine abolish the proton motive force and decrease the intracellular ATP 
concentration. This is accompanied by induction of degP expression, as a result 
of the activation of the RpoE (SigmaE) extra-cytoplasmic stress response, and 
activation of the psp operon. Such effects of verapamil, as a membrane active 
compound, could explain its general toxicity in eukaryotic cells.

in response to extracytoplasmic stress.

We have previously shown that the TolA protein is required for the correct 
surface expression of the Escherichia coli O7 antigen lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 
In this work, delta tolA and delta pal mutants of E. coli K-12 W3110 were 
transformed with pMF19 (encoding a rhamnosyltransferase that reconstitutes the 
expression of O16-specific LPS), pWQ5 (encoding the Klebsiella pneumoniae O1 LPS 
gene cluster), or pWQ802 (encoding the genes necessary for the synthesis of 
Salmonella enterica O:54). Both DeltatolA and delta pal mutants exhibited 
reduced surface expression of O16 LPS as compared to parental W3110, but no 
significant differences were observed in the expression of K. pneumoniae O1 LPS 
and S. enterica O:54 LPS. Therefore, TolA and Pal are required for the correct 
surface expression of O antigens that are assembled in a wzy 
(polymerase)-dependent manner (like those of E. coli O7 and O16) but not for O 
antigens assembled by wzy-independent pathways (like K. pneumoniae O1 and S. 
enterica O:54). Furthermore, we show that the reduced surface expression of O16 
LPS in delta tolA and delta pal mutants was associated with a partial defect in 
O-antigen polymerization and it was corrected by complementation with intact 
tolA and pal genes, respectively. Using derivatives of W3110 delta tolA and 
W3110 delta pal containing lacZ reporter fusions to fkpA and degP, we also 
demonstrate that the RpoE-mediated extracytoplasmic stress response is 
upregulated in these mutants. Moreover, an altered O16 polymerization was also 
detected under conditions that stimulate RpoE-mediated extracytoplasmic stress 
responses in tol+ and pal+ genetic backgrounds. A Wzy derivative with an epitope 
tag at the C-terminal end of the protein was stable in all the mutants, ruling 
out stress-mediated proteolysis of Wzy. We conclude that the absence of TolA and 
Pal elicits a sustained extracytoplasmic stress response that in turn reduces 
O-antigen polymerization but does not affect the stability of the Wzy O-antigen 
polymerase.

In Escherichia coli, envelope stress is regulated by the alternative sigma 
factor sigma(E) and the two-component regulatory system CpxRA. Both systems 
overlap in the transcriptional regulation of the htrA gene encoding a protease 
that degrades misfolded proteins in the periplasm. In Yersinia enterocolitica, 
HtrA is important for intracellular survival and full virulence in animal 
models. Here we show that regulation of htrA expression in Y. enterocolitica is 
dependent on CpxR and putatively also on RpoE. However, the stimuli inducing 
both systems were different from E. coli. Most strikingly, we found that 
overproduction of an outer membrane protein, a typical stimulus for the 
induction of htrA expression via RpoE in E. coli, led to the induction of htrA 
expression via the Cpx system in Y. enterocolitica. Interestingly, a Y. 
enterocolitica CpxR mutant strain was not impaired for virulence in a mouse 
model of infection.

In vitro transcription analysis has shown that only RNA polymerase containing an 
alternative sigma subunit, sigma E, activates transcription from one of the rpoH 
promoters and the htrA promoter. The location of the rpoE gene encoding sigma E 
on the Escherichia coli chromosome has recently been established, but no rpoE 
mutant has yet become available for phenotypic testing. We cloned the rpoE gene 
from the lambda-ordered clones of the E. coli genome and confirmed that the 
reconstituted RNA polymerase containing the gene product (E sigma E) can 
transcribe htrA in vitro. We constructed an rpoE-defective strain by gene 
disruption using the cloned rpoE gene. We demonstrate that expression of htrA is 
completely dependent on the rpoE gene in vivo and that the rpoE gene is 
essential for bacterial growth at high temperature.

The rpoE gene encoding the sigma E (sigma 24) heat shock sigma factor of 
Escherichia coli.

Previous work has established that the transcription factor sigma E (sigma 24) 
is necessary for maintaining the induction of the heat shock response of 
Escherichia coli at high temperatures. We have identified the gene encoding 
sigma E using a genetic screen designed to isolate trans-acting mutations that 
abolish expression from either htrA or rpoHP3, two promoters recognized uniquely 
by sigma E-containing RNA polymerase. Such a screen was achieved by transducing 
strains carrying a single copy of either phtrA-lacZ or rpoHP3-lacZ fusions with 
mutagenized bacteriophage P1 lysates and screening for Lac- mutant colonies at 
22 degrees C. Lac- mutants were subsequently tested for inability to grow at 43 
degrees C (Ts- phenotype). Only those Lac- Ts- mutants that were unable to 
accumulate heat shock proteins at 50 degrees C were retained for further 
characterization. In a complementary approach, those genes which when cloned on 
a multicopy plasmid led to higher constitutive expression of the sigma E regulon 
were characterized and mapped. Both approaches identified the same gene, rpoE, 
mapping at 55.5 min on the E.coli genetic map and encoding a polypeptide of 191 
amino acid residues. The wild-type and a mutant rpoE gene products were 
over-expressed and purified. It was found that the purified wild-type sigma E 
protein, when used in in vitro run-off transcription assays in combination with 
core RNA polymerase, was able to direct transcription from the htrA and rpoHP3 
promoters, but not from known sigma 70-dependent promoters. In vivo and in vitro 
analyses of rpoE transcriptional regulation showed that the rpoE gene is 
transcribed from two major promoters, one of which is positively regulated by 
sigma E itself.

Most existing genomic engineering protocols for manipulation of Escherichia coli 
are primarily focused on chromosomal gene knockout. In this study, a simple but 
systematic chromosomal gene knock-in method was proposed based on a previously 
developed protocol using bacteriophage λ (λ Red) and flippase-flippase 
recognition targets (FLP-FRT) recombinations. For demonstration purposes, DNA 
operons containing heterologous genes (i.e., pac encoding E. coli penicillin 
acylase and palB2 encoding Pseudozyma antarctica lipase B mutant) engineered 
with regulatory elements, such as strong/inducible promoters (i.e., P( trc ) and 
P( araB )), operators, and ribosomal binding sites, were integrated into the E. 
coli genome at designated locations (i.e., lacZYA, dbpA, and lacI-mhpR loci) 
either as a gene replacement or gene insertion using various antibiotic 
selection markers (i.e., kanamycin and chloramphenicol) under various genetic 
backgrounds (i.e., HB101 and DH5α). The expression of the inserted foreign genes 
was subjected to regulation using appropriate inducers [isopropyl β-D: 
-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and arabinose] at tunable concentrations. The 
developed approach not only enables more extensive genomic engineering of E. 
coli, but also paves an effective way to "tailor" plasmid-free E. coli strains 
with desired genotypes suitable for various biotechnological applications, such 
as biomanufacturing and metabolic engineering.

Most organisms are exposed to the genotoxic chemical formaldehyde, either from 
endogenous or environmental sources. Therefore, biology has evolved systems to 
perceive and detoxify formaldehyde. The frmRA(B) operon that is present in many 
bacteria represents one such system. The FrmR protein is a transcriptional 
repressor that is specifically inactivated in the presence of formaldehyde, 
permitting expression of the formaldehyde detoxification machinery (FrmA and 
FrmB, when the latter is present). The X-ray structure of the 
formaldehyde-treated Escherichia coli FrmR (EcFrmR) protein reveals the 
formation of methylene bridges that link adjacent Pro2 and Cys35 residues in the 
EcFrmR tetramer. Methylene bridge formation has profound effects on the pattern 
of surface charge of EcFrmR and combined with biochemical/biophysical data 
suggests a mechanistic model for formaldehyde-sensing and derepression of 
frmRA(B) expression in numerous bacterial species.

Expression of an amber suppressor tRNA should result in read-through of the 326 
open reading frames (ORFs) that terminate with amber stop codons in the 
Escherichia coli genome, including six pseudogenes. Abnormal extension of an ORF 
might alter the activities of the protein and have effects on cellular 
physiology, while suppression of a pseudogene could lead to a gain of function. 
We used oligonucleotide microarrays to determine if any effects were apparent at 
the level of transcription in glucose minimal medium. Surprisingly, only eight 
genes had significantly different expression in the presence of the suppressor. 
Among these were the genes yaiN, adhC, and yaiM, forming a single putative 
operon whose likely function is the degradation of formaldehyde. Expression of 
wild-type yaiN was shown to result in repression of the operon, while a 
suppression-mimicking allele lacking the amber stop codon and extended 7 amino 
acids did not. The operon was shown to be induced by formaldehyde, and the genes 
have been renamed frmR, frmA, and frmB, respectively.

The DUF156 family of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators includes metal 
sensors that respond to cobalt and/or nickel (RcnR, InrS) or copper (CsoR) plus 
CstR, which responds to persulfide, and formaldehyde-responsive FrmR. 
Unexpectedly, the allosteric mechanism of FrmR from Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium is triggered by metals in vitro, and variant FrmR(E64H) gains 
responsiveness to Zn(II) and cobalt in vivo Here we establish that the 
allosteric mechanism of FrmR is triggered directly by formaldehyde in vitro 
Sensitivity to formaldehyde requires a cysteine (Cys(35) in FrmR) conserved in 
all DUF156 proteins. A crystal structure of metal- and formaldehyde-sensing 
FrmR(E64H) reveals that an FrmR-specific amino-terminal Pro(2) is proximal to 
Cys(35), and these residues form the deduced formaldehyde-sensing site. Evidence 
is presented that implies that residues spatially close to the conserved 
cysteine tune the sensitivities of DUF156 proteins above or below critical 
thresholds for different effectors, generating the semblance of specificity 
within cells. Relative to FrmR, RcnR is less responsive to formaldehyde in 
vitro, and RcnR does not sense formaldehyde in vivo, but reciprocal mutations 
FrmR(P2S) and RcnR(S2P), respectively, impair and enhance formaldehyde 
reactivity in vitro Formaldehyde detoxification by FrmA requires 
S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione, yet glutathione inhibits formaldehyde detection by 
FrmR in vivo and in vitro Quantifying the number of FrmR molecules per cell and 
modeling formaldehyde modification as a function of [formaldehyde] demonstrates 
that FrmR reactivity is optimized such that FrmR is modified and frmRA is 
derepressed at lower [formaldehyde] than required to generate 
S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione. Expression of FrmA is thereby coordinated with the 
accumulation of its substrate.

Expression of an amber suppressor tRNA should result in read-through of the 326 
open reading frames (ORFs) that terminate with amber stop codons in the 
Escherichia coli genome, including six pseudogenes. Abnormal extension of an ORF 
might alter the activities of the protein and have effects on cellular 
physiology, while suppression of a pseudogene could lead to a gain of function. 
We used oligonucleotide microarrays to determine if any effects were apparent at 
the level of transcription in glucose minimal medium. Surprisingly, only eight 
genes had significantly different expression in the presence of the suppressor. 
Among these were the genes yaiN, adhC, and yaiM, forming a single putative 
operon whose likely function is the degradation of formaldehyde. Expression of 
wild-type yaiN was shown to result in repression of the operon, while a 
suppression-mimicking allele lacking the amber stop codon and extended 7 amino 
acids did not. The operon was shown to be induced by formaldehyde, and the genes 
have been renamed frmR, frmA, and frmB, respectively.

Ni(II) Sensing by RcnR Does Not Require an FrmR-Like Intersubunit Linkage.

Huang HT, Maroney MJ.

E. coli RcnR (resistance to cobalt and nickel regulator) is a homotetrameric DNA 
binding protein that regulates the expression of a Ni(II) and Co(II) exporter 
(RcnAB) by derepressing expression of rcnA and rcnB in response to binding 
Co(II) or Ni(II). Prior studies have shown that the cognate metal ions, Ni(II) 
and Co(II), bind in six-coordinate sites at subunit interfaces and are 
distinguished from noncognate metals (Cu(I), Cu(II), and Zn(II)) by coordination 
number and ligand selection. In analogy with FrmR, a formaldehyde-responsive 
transcriptional regulator in the RcnR/CsoR family, the interfacial site allows 
the metal ions to "cross-link" the N-terminal domain of one subunit with the 
invariant Cys35 residue in another, which has been deemed to be key to mediating 
the allosteric response of the tetrameric protein to metal binding. Through the 
use of mutagenesis to disconnect one subunit from the metal-mediated cross-link, 
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as a structural probe, LacZ reporter assays, 
and metal binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the work 
presented here shows that neither the interfacial binding site nor the 
coordination number of Ni(II) is important to the allosteric response to binding 
of this cognate metal ion. The opposite is found for the other cognate metal 
ion, Co(II), with respect to the interfacial binding site, suggesting that the 
molecular mechanisms for transcriptional regulation by the two ions are 
distinct. The metal binding studies reveal that tight metal binding is 
maintained in the variant. XAS is further used to demonstrate that His33 is not 
a ligand for Co(II), Ni(II), or Zn(II) in WT-RcnR. The results are discussed in 
the context of the overall understanding of the molecular mechanisms of 
metallosensors.

FrmR from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (a CsoR/RcnR-like 
transcriptional de-repressor) is shown to repress the frmRA operator-promoter, 
and repression is alleviated by formaldehyde but not manganese, iron, cobalt, 
nickel, copper, or Zn(II) within cells. In contrast, repression by a mutant 
FrmRE64H (which gains an RcnR metal ligand) is alleviated by cobalt and Zn(II). 
Unexpectedly, FrmR was found to already bind Co(II), Zn(II), and Cu(I), and 
moreover metals, as well as formaldehyde, trigger an allosteric response that 
weakens DNA affinity. However, the sensory metal sites of the cells' endogenous 
metal sensors (RcnR, ZntR, Zur, and CueR) are all tighter than FrmR for their 
cognate metals. Furthermore, the endogenous metal sensors are shown to 
out-compete FrmR. The metal-sensing FrmRE64H mutant has tighter metal affinities 
than FrmR by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Gain of cobalt sensing by 
FrmRE64H remains enigmatic because the cobalt affinity of FrmRE64H is 
substantially weaker than that of the endogenous cobalt sensor. Cobalt sensing 
requires glutathione, which may assist cobalt access, conferring a kinetic 
advantage. For Zn(II), the metal affinity of FrmRE64H approaches the metal 
affinities of cognate Zn(II) sensors. Counter-intuitively, the allosteric 
coupling free energy for Zn(II) is smaller in metal-sensing FrmRE64H compared 
with nonsensing FrmR. By determining the copies of FrmR and FrmRE64H tetramers 
per cell, then estimating promoter occupancy as a function of intracellular 
Zn(II) concentration, we show how a modest tightening of Zn(II) affinity, plus 
weakened DNA affinity of the apoprotein, conspires to make the relative 
properties of FrmRE64H (compared with ZntR and Zur) sufficient to sense Zn(II) 
inside cells.

Escherichia coli O157:H7 poses a threat to humans through food- and water-borne 
transmission. To investigate how environmental stresses affect the Escherichia 
coli O157:H7 transcriptome, we designed a targeted microarray consisting of 
stress response and virulence genes (n = 125) to analyze the impact of acidified 
(pH 3.5), cold (7.5 degrees C), and fresh tryptic soy broth (TSB) (37 degrees C) 
on E. coli O157:H7 stress response and virulence gene expression. Nutrient 
replenishment with fresh TSB resulted in 72 differentially expressed genes (> or 
= 1.5-fold change; p < 0.05), with 65 induced. All queried global and specific 
stress regulators were affected, as were 12 virulence genes. Cold-shocked cells 
displayed 17 differentially expressed genes, with 10 being induced. Induction of 
rpoS, members of the sigma(H) regulon (clpB, dnaK, ftsH), and acid resistance 
(AR) genes (gadA, gadX) was observed. Porin transcript (ompC, ompF) and gapA and 
tufA ancillary genes were repressed. Acid shock resulted in 24 differentially 
expressed genes, with 21 induced. No induction of any stationary phase AR system 
was observed, though acid-coping mechanisms were recruited, including mar and 
phoB induction, and repression of ompC and ompF. Stress regulators were induced, 
including relA, soxS, rpoE, and rpoH. The microarray data were validated by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Exposure to sublethal stress 
events led to the induction of diverse stress response networks. In the food 
chain, sublethal events may render cells increasingly resistant to future 
stresses, potentially leading to increased survival.

BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli O157:H7 (O157) strain 86-24, linked to a 1986 
disease outbreak, displays curli- and biofilm-negative phenotypes that are 
correlated with the lack of Congo red (CR) binding and formation of white 
colonies (CR-) on a CR-containing medium. However, on a CR medium this strain 
produces red isolates (CR+) capable of producing curli fimbriae and biofilms.
RESULTS: To identify genes controlling differential expression of curli fimbriae 
and biofilm formation, the RNA-Seq profile of a CR+ isolate was compared to the 
CR- parental isolate. Of the 242 genes expressed differentially in the CR+ 
isolate, 201 genes encoded proteins of known functions while the remaining 41 
encoded hypothetical proteins. Among the genes with known functions, 149 were 
down- and 52 were up-regulated. Some of the upregulated genes were linked to 
biofilm formation through biosynthesis of curli fimbriae and flagella. The genes 
encoding transcriptional regulators, such as CsgD, QseB, YkgK, YdeH, Bdm, CspD, 
BssR and FlhDC, which modulate biofilm formation, were significantly altered in 
their expression. Several genes of the envelope stress (cpxP), heat shock (rpoH, 
htpX, degP), oxidative stress (ahpC, katE), nutrient limitation stress 
(phoB-phoR and pst) response pathways, and amino acid metabolism were 
downregulated in the CR+ isolate. Many genes mediating acid resistance and 
colanic acid biosynthesis, which influence biofilm formation directly or 
indirectly, were also down-regulated. Comparative genomics of CR+ and CR- 
isolates revealed the presence of a short duplicated sequence in the rcsB gene 
of the CR+ isolate. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of RcsB of the two 
isolates showed truncation of RcsB in the CR+ isolate at the insertion site of 
the duplicated sequence. Complementation of CR+ isolate with rcsB of the CR- 
parent restored parental phenotypes to the CR+ isolate.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that RcsB is a global regulator 
affecting bacterial survival in growth-restrictive environments through 
upregulation of genes promoting biofilm formation while downregulating certain 
metabolic functions. Understanding whether rcsB inactivation enhances 
persistence and survival of O157 in carrier animals and the environment would be 
important in developing strategies for controlling this bacterial pathogen in 
these niches.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) has multiple copies of the chaperone-usher (CU) pili 
operon in five fimbria groups: CU pili, curli, type IV pili, type III secretion 
pili, and type IV secretion pili. Commensal E. coli K-12 contains 12 CU pili 
operons. Among these operons, Sfm is expressed by the sfmACDHF operon. 
Transcriptome analyses, reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR 
analyses reported that FimZ directly binds to and activates the sfmA promoter, 
transcribing sfmACDHF. In addition, FimZ regularly induces constant cell 
elongation in E. coli, which is required for F-type ATPase function. The 
bacterial two-hybrid system showed a specific interaction between FimZ and the α 
subunit of the cytoplasmic F1 domain of F-type ATPase. Studies performed using 
mutated FimZs have revealed two active forms, I and II. Active form I is 
required for constant cell elongation involving amino acid residues K106 and 
D109. Active form II additionally required D56, a putative phosphorylation site, 
to activate the sfmA promoter. The chromosomal fimZ was hardly expressed in 
parent strain but functioned in phoB and phoP double-gene knockout strains. 
These insights may help to understand bacterial invasion restricted host 
environments by the sfm γ-type pili.

Cryptic prophages are not genomic junk but instead enable cells to combat myriad 
stresses as an active stress response. How these phage fossils affect persister 
cell resuscitation has, however, not been explored. Persister cells form as a 
result of stresses such as starvation, antibiotics and oxidative conditions, and 
resuscitation of these persister cells likely causes recurring infections such 
as those associated with tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis and Lyme disease. 
Deletion of each of the nine Escherichia coli cryptic prophages has no effect on 
persister cell formation. Strikingly, elimination of each cryptic prophage 
results in an increase in persister cell resuscitation with a dramatic increase 
in resuscitation upon deleting all nine prophages. This increased resuscitation 
includes eliminating the need for a carbon source and is due to activation of 
the phosphate import system resulting from inactivating the transcriptional 
regulator AlpA of the CP4-57 cryptic prophage. Deletion of alpA increases 
persister resuscitation, and AlpA represses phosphate regulator PhoR. Both 
phosphate regulators PhoP and PhoB stimulate resuscitation. This suggests a 
novel cellular stress mechanism controlled by cryptic prophages: regulation of 
phosphate uptake which controls the exit of the cell from dormancy and prevents 
premature resuscitation in the absence of nutrients.

Bacteria survive in the environment with three steps: a sensing environmental 
conditions, a responding to sensed signals, and an adaptation for proper 
survival in the environment. An adapting bacterial cell occurs cell division to 
increase the number of sister cells, termed adaptive growth. Two-component 
systems (TCSs), representing the main bacterial signal transduction systems, 
consist of a pair of one sensor kinase (SK) and one response regulator (RR), and 
RR genes are abundant in most bacterial genomes as part of the core genome. The 
OmpR gene family, a group of RR genes, is conserved in 95% of known bacterial 
genomes. The Escherichia coli genome has an estimated 34 RR genes in total, 
including 14 genes of OmpR family genes. To reveal the contribution of TCSs for 
fast growth as an adaptive growth strategy of E. coli, we isolated a set of gene 
knockout strains by using newly developed genome editing technology, the HoSeI 
(Homologous Sequence Integration) method, based on CRISPR-Cas9. The statistics 
of single cell observation show a knockout of an arbitrary pair of phoP, phoB, 
and ompR genes, stably expressed by positive feedback regulation, dramatically 
inhibit the optimum adaptive growth of E. coli. These insights suggest that the 
adaptive growth of bacteria is fulfilled by the optimum high intracellular level 
of regulators acquired during growth under environmental conditions.

Activation of the PhoPR-Mediated Response to Phosphate Limitation Is Regulated 
by Wall Teichoic Acid Metabolism in Bacillus subtilis.

Phosphorous is essential for cell viability. To ensure an adequate supply under 
phosphate limiting conditions, bacteria induce a cohort of enzymes to scavenge 
for phosphate, and a high affinity transporter for its uptake into the cell. 
This response is controlled by a two-component signal transduction system named 
PhoBR in Escherichia coli and PhoPR in Bacillus subtilis. PhoR is a sensor 
kinase whose activity is responsive to phosphate availability. Under phosphate 
limiting conditions, PhoR exists in kinase mode that phosphorylates its cognate 
response regulator (PhoB, PhoP). When activated, PhoB∼P/PhoP∼P execute changes 
in gene expression that adapt cells to the phosphate limited state. Under 
phosphate replete conditions, PhoR exists in phosphatase mode that maintains 
PhoB/PhoP in an inactive, non-phosphorylated state. The mechanism by which 
phosphate availability is sensed and how it controls the balance between PhoR 
kinase and phosphatase activities has been studied in E. coli and B. subtilis. 
Two different mechanisms have emerged. In the most common mechanism, PhoR 
activity is responsive to phosphate transport through a PstSCAB/PhoU signaling 
complex that relays the conformational status of the transporter to PhoR. In the 
second mechanism currently confined to B. subtilis, PhoR activity is responsive 
to wall teichoic acid metabolism whereby biosynthetic intermediates can promote 
or inhibit PhoR autokinase activity. Variations of both mechanisms are found 
that allow each bacterial species to adapt to phosphate availability in their 
particular environmental niche.

Phosphorus is an essential element assimilated largely as orthophosphate (Pi). 
Cells respond to Pi starvation by importing Pi from their surroundings. We now 
report that impaired protein synthesis alone triggers a Pi starvation response 
even when Pi is plentiful in the extracellular milieu. In the bacterium 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, this response entails phosphorylation 
of the regulatory protein PhoB and transcription of PhoB-dependent Pi 
transporter genes and is eliminated upon stimulation of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) hydrolysis. When protein synthesis is impaired due to low cytoplasmic 
magnesium (Mg2+), Salmonella triggers the Pi starvation response because 
ribosomes are destabilized, which reduces ATP consumption and thus free 
cytoplasmic Pi. This response is transient because low cytoplasmic Mg2+ promotes 
an uptake in Mg2+ and a decrease in ATP levels, which stabilizes ribosomes, 
resulting in ATP consumption and Pi increase, thus ending the response. Notably, 
pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis also elicited a Pi starvation 
response in the bacterium Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae Our findings identify a regulatory connection between protein 
synthesis and Pi homeostasis that is widespread in nature.

DNA-binding specificity of the virulence-associated response regulator from 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis PhoP-PhoR two-component system is essential for 
virulence in animal models of tuberculosis. Genetic and biochemical studies 
indicate that PhoP regulates the expression of more than 110 genes in M. 
tuberculosis. The C-terminal effector domain of PhoP exhibits a winged 
helix-turn-helix motif with the molecular surfaces around the recognition helix 
(alpha 8) displaying strong positive electrostatic potential, suggesting its 
role in DNA binding and nucleotide sequence recognition. Here, the relative 
importance of interfacial alpha 8-DNA contacts has been tested through rational 
mutagenesis coupled with in vitro binding-affinity studies. Most PhoP mutants, 
each with a potential DNA contacting residue replaced with Ala, had 
significantly reduced DNA binding affinity. However, substitution of 
nonconserved Glu215 had a major effect on the specificity of recognition. 
Although lack of specificity does not necessarily correlate with gross change in 
the overall DNA binding properties of PhoP, structural superposition of the PhoP 
C-domain on the Escherichia coli PhoB C-domain-DNA complex suggests a 
base-specific interaction between Glu215 of PhoP and the ninth base of the DR1 
repeat motif. Biochemical experiments corroborate these results, showing that 
DNA recognition specificity can be altered by as little as a single residue 
change of the protein or a single base change of the DNA. The results have 
implications for the mechanism of sequence-specific DNA binding by PhoP.

The response regulator PhoP is part of the PhoQ/PhoP two-component system 
involved in responses to depletion of extracellular Mg(2+). Here, we report the 
crystal structures of the receiver domain of Escherichia coli PhoP determined in 
the absence and presence of the phosphoryl analog beryllofluoride. In the 
presence of beryllofluoride, the active receiver domain forms a twofold 
symmetric dimer similar to that seen in structures of other regulatory domains 
from the OmpR/PhoB family, providing further evidence that members of this 
family utilize a common mode of dimerization in the active state. In the absence 
of activating agents, the PhoP receiver domain crystallizes with a similar 
structure, consistent with the previous observation that high concentrations can 
promote an active state of PhoP independent of phosphorylation.

Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, England.

The response regulator VicR from the Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus 
faecalis forms part of the two-component signal transduction system of the YycFG 
subfamily. The structure of the DNA-binding domain of VicR, VicR(c), has been 
solved and belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family. It is very similar to 
the DNA-binding domains of Escherichia coli PhoB and OmpR, despite low sequence 
similarity, but differs in two important loops. The alpha-loop, which links the 
two helices of the helix-turn-helix motif, is similar to that of PhoB, where it 
has been implicated in contacting the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase, but 
differs from that of OmpR. Conversely, the loop following the helix-turn-helix 
motif is similar to that of OmpR and differs from that of PhoB. YycF/VicR, PhoB 
and Bacillus subtilis PhoP regulators all recognize almost identical DNA 
sequences and although there is currently no experimental evidence linking this 
loop with the DNA, the structure is consistent with possible involvement in 
selective DNA recognition or binding.

A variety of bacterial cellular responses to environmental signals are mediated 
by two-component signal transduction systems comprising a membrane-associated 
histidine protein kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator (RR), which 
interpret specific stimuli and produce a measured physiological response. In RR 
activation, transient phosphorylation of a highly conserved aspartic acid 
residue drives the conformation changes needed for full activation of the 
protein. Sequence homology reveals that RR02 from Streptococcus pneumoniae 
belongs to the OmpR subfamily of RRs. The structures of the receiver domains 
from four members of this family, DrrB and DrrD from Thermotoga maritima, PhoB 
from Escherichia coli, and PhoP from Bacillus subtilis, have been elucidated. 
These domains are globally very similar in that they are composed of a doubly 
wound alpha(5)beta(5); however, they differ remarkably in the fine detail of the 
beta4-alpha4 and alpha4 regions. The structures presented here reveal a further 
difference of the geometry in this region. RR02 is has been shown to be the 
essential RR in the gram-positive bacterium S. pneumoniae R. Lange, C. Wagner,

ultimately controls the levels of competence within the bacteria. Here we report 
the native structure of the receiver domain of RR02 from serotype 4 S. 
pneumoniae (as well as acetate- and phosphate-bound forms) at different pH 
levels. Two native structures at 2.3 A, phased by single-wavelength anomalous 
diffraction (xenon SAD), and 1.85 A and a third structure at pH 5.9 revealed the 
presence of a phosphate ion outside the active site. The fourth structure 
revealed the presence of an acetate molecule in the active site.

Residues required for Bacillus subtilis PhoP DNA binding or RNA polymerase 
interaction: alanine scanning of PhoP effector domain transactivation loop and 
alpha helix 3.

Bacillus subtilis PhoP is a member of the OmpR family of response regulators 
that activates or represses genes of the Pho regulon upon phosphorylation by 
PhoR in response to phosphate deficiency. Because PhoP binds DNA and is a dimer 
in solution independent of its phosphorylation state, phosphorylation of PhoP 
may optimize DNA binding or the interaction with RNA polymerase. We describe 
alanine scanning mutagenesis of the PhoP alpha loop and alpha helix 3 region of 
PhoPC (Val190 to E214) and functional analysis of the mutated proteins. Eight 
residues important for DNA binding were clustered between Val202 and Arg210. 
Using in vivo and in vitro functional analyses, we identified three classes of 
mutated proteins. Class I proteins (PhoP(I206A), PhoP(R210A), PhoP(L209A), and 
PhoP(H208A)) were phosphorylation proficient and could dimerize but could not 
bind DNA or activate transcription in vivo or in vitro. Class II proteins 
(PhoP(H205A) and PhoP(V204A)) were phosphorylation proficient and could dimerize 
but could not bind DNA prior to phosphorylation. Members of this class had 
higher transcription activation in vitro than in vivo. The class III mutants, 
PhoP(V202A) and PhoP(D203A), had a reduced rate of phosphotransfer and could 
dimerize but could not bind DNA or activate transcription in vivo or in vitro. 
Seven alanine substitutions in PhoP (PhoP(V190A), PhoP(W191A), PhoP(Y193A), 
PhoP(F195A), PhoP(G197A,) PhoP(T199A), and PhoP(R200A)) that specifically 
affected transcription activation were broadly distributed throughout the 
transactivation loop extending from Val190 to as far toward the C terminus as 
Arg200. PhoP(W191A) and PhoP(R200A) could not activate transcription, while the 
other five mutant proteins showed decreased transcription activation in vivo or 
in vitro or both. The mutagenesis studies may indicate that PhoP has a long 
transactivation loop and a short alpha helix 3, more similar to OmpR than to 
PhoB of Escherichia coli.

Phosphate is one of the major constituents in growth media. It closely regulates 
central carbon and energy metabolism. Biochemical reactions in central carbon 
metabolism are known to be regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of 
enzymes. Phosphate scarcity can limit microbial productivity. However, 
microorganisms are evolved to grow in phosphate starvation environments. This 
study investigates the effect of phosphate-starved response (PSR) stimuli in 
wild-type and recombinant Escherichia coli cells cultivated in two different 
substrates, lactose, and glycerol. Phosphate-starved E. coli culture sustained 
bacterial growth despite the metabolic burden that emanated from recombinant 
protein expression albeit with altered dynamics of substrate utilisation. 
Induction of lactose in phosphate-starved culture led to a 2-fold improvement in 
product titre of rSymlin and a 2.3-fold improvement in product titre of rLTNF as 
compared with phosphate-unlimited culture. The results obtained in the study are 
in agreement with the literature to infer that phosphate starvation or 
limitation can slow down the microbial growth rate in order to produce 
recombinant proteins. Further, under PSR conditions, gene expression analysis 
demonstrated that while selected genes (gapdh, pykF, ppsA, icdA) in glycolysis 
and pentose phosphate pathway (zwf, gnd, talB, tktA) were up-regulated, other 
genes in lactose (lacY, lacA) and acetate (ackA, pta) pathway were 
down-regulated. We have demonstrated that cra, crp, phoB, and phoR are involved 
in the regulation of central carbon metabolism. We propose a novel 
cross-regulation between lactose metabolism and phosphate starvation. 
UDP-galactose, a toxic metabolite that is known to cause cell lysis, has been 
shown to be significantly reduced due to slow uptake of lactose under PSR 
conditions. Therefore, E. coli employs a decoupling strategy by limiting growth 
and redirecting metabolic resources to survive and produce recombinant protein 
under phosphate starvation conditions. KEY POINTS: • Phosphate starvation 
controls lactose metabolism, which results in less galactose accumulation. • 
Phosphate starvation modulates metabolic flow of central carbon metabolism. • 
Product titre improves by 2-fold due to phosphate starvation. • The approach has 
been successfully applied to production of two different proteins.

Molecular characterization of mutants affected in the osmoprotectant-dependent 
induction of phospholipase C in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.

Production of the two phospholipases C (PLCs) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is 
induced under conditions of phosphate limitation, or by the osmoprotectants 
choline or glycine betaine. Tn5 mutagenesis was performed on strain PAO1 to 
isolate mutants deficient in choline-dependent induction of PLC. Two mutants, 
Tn5T1 and Tn5G19, were identified which produce decreased levels of PLC in 
phosphate-replete media supplemented with choline. A total of 136 and 496 bp of 
flanking DNA from Tn5G19 and Tn5T1 was cloned by an inverse polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and sequenced. The DNA flanking the Tn5T1 insertion contains an 
open reading frame predicted to encode a peptide that is approx. 60% identical 
to the N-terminus of a previously identified protein (P35) of unknown function 
from Escherichia coli. The P35 gene, which is located in the nusA-infB operon in 
E. coll, was designated orp (osmoprotectant regulator of PLC). Haemolytic 
titres, total PlcH protein and beta-galactosidase activity expressed from a 
chromosomally inserted plcH-lacZ operon fusion were reduced in strain Tn5T1 in 
comparison with the parental strain (PAO1) carrying the same fusion. However, 
this mutant expressed several-fold higher levels of plcH message than strain 
PAO1 in the presence of choline, while the phosphate-starvation-dependent 
transcript of plcH could not be detected in this mutant. The defects in Tn5T1 
are complemented by a DNA fragment, isolated from a genomic library of PAO1, 
that carries the orp gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of the DNA fragment 
cloned from Tn5G19 exhibits 84% identity with the betB gene product of E. coli 
that has betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. This enzyme catalyses the 
conversion of betaine aldehyde to glycine-betaine. Unlike the parental strain, 
the Tn5G19 mutant could not utilize choline as a sole carbon, nitrogen and 
energy source, and it was deficient in betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. 
Also, consistent with a disruption of betB in Tn5G19, choline inhibited growth 
of this strain in media containing 0.7 M NaCl, while glycine-betaine restores 
growth to wild-type levels. The defects in Tn5G19 are complemented by a DNA 
fragment from PAO1 that carries the betB gene. The orp gene is located between 
0.6 to 6.6 min while betB is located between 10.5 to 12.5 min on the chromosome 
of PAO1.

Role of the sigma 70 subunit of RNA polymerase in transcriptional activation by 
activator protein PhoB in Escherichia coli.

(1)Department of Experimental Chemotherapy, Osaka University, Japan.

Transcription of the genes belonging to the phosphate (pho) regulon in 
Escherichia coli, which are induced by phosphate starvation, requires the 
specific activator protein PhoB in addition to the RNA polymerase holoenzyme 
containing the major sigma-factor sigma 70. To study the mechanism of 
transcriptional activation and identify the subunit of RNA polymerase involved 
in specific interaction with PhoB, we attempted to isolate rpoA and rpoD mutants 
that are specifically defective in the expression of the pho genes. We isolated 
two rpoD mutants with such properties, but no rpoA mutant with similar 
properties. The rpoD mutations altered amino acids within and near the first 
helix of the putative helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif in the carboxy-terminal 
region of sigma 70. Activities of the pho promoters in vivo were severely 
reduced in these mutants, whereas those of the PhoB-independent promoters were 
affected only marginally at most. The reconstituted mutant RNA polymerase 
holoenzymes were severely defective in transcribing the pstS gene, one of the 
pho genes, whereas they were efficient in transcribing the PhoB-independent 
promoters. Phosphorylated PhoB, which binds to the pho promoters with high 
affinity, mediated the specific binding of the wild-type holoenzyme to the pstS 
promoter, but it did not mediate the binding of the mutant holoenzymes. These 
results suggest that PhoB promotes specific interaction between RNA polymerase 
and the pho promoters for transcriptional activation, and the first helix of the 
putative HTH motif plays an essential role in the interaction, probably by 
making direct contact with PhoB.

Preprotein translocation by a hybrid translocase composed of Escherichia coli

Bacterial protein translocation is mediated by translocase, a multisubunit 
membrane protein complex that consists of a peripheral ATPase SecA and a 
preprotein-conducting channel with SecY, SecE, and SecG as subunits. Like 
Escherichia coli SecG, the Bacillus subtilis homologue, YvaL, dramatically 
stimulated the ATP-dependent translocation of precursor PhoB (prePhoB) by the B. 
subtilis SecA-SecYE complex. To systematically determine the functional 
exchangeability of translocase subunits, all of the relevant combinations of the 
E. coli and B. subtilis secY, secE, and secG genes were expressed in E. coli. 
Hybrid SecYEG complexes were overexpressed at high levels. Since SecY could not 
be overproduced without SecE, these data indicate a stable interaction between 
the heterologous SecY and SecE subunits. E. coli SecA, but not B. subtilis SecA, 
supported efficient ATP-dependent translocation of the E. coli precursor OmpA 
(proOmpA) into inner membrane vesicles containing the hybrid SecYEG complexes, 
if E. coli SecY and either E. coli SecE or E. coli SecG were present. 
Translocation of B. subtilis prePhoB, on the other hand, showed a strict 
dependence on the translocase subunit composition and occurred efficiently only 
with the homologous translocase. In contrast to E. coli SecA, B. subtilis SecA 
binds the SecYEG complexes only with low affinity. These results suggest that 
each translocase subunit contributes in an exclusive manner to the specificity 
and functionality of the complex.

The OmpR/PhoB family of response regulators (RRs) is the largest class of 
two-component system signal transduction proteins. Extensive biochemical and 
structural characterization of these transcription factors has provided insights 
into their activation and DNA-binding mechanisms. For the most part, OmpR/PhoB 
family proteins are thought to become activated through phosphorylation from 
their cognate histidine kinase partners, which in turn facilitates an allosteric 
change in the RR, enabling homodimerization and subsequently enhanced DNA 
binding. Incongruently, it has been suggested that OmpR, the eponymous member of 
this RR family, becomes activated via different mechanisms, whereby DNA binding 
plays a central role in facilitating dimerization and phosphorylation. 
Characterization of the rate and extent of the phosphorylation of OmpR and OmpR 
DNA-binding mutants following activation of the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system 
shows that DNA binding is not essential for phosphorylation of OmpR in vivo. In 
addition, detailed analyses of the energetics of DNA binding and dimerization of 
OmpR in both its unphosphorylated and phosphorylated state indicate that 
phosphorylation enhances OmpR dimerization and that this dimerization 
enhancement is the energetic driving force for phosphorylation-mediated 
regulation of OmpR-DNA binding. These findings suggest that OmpR 
phosphorylation-mediated activation follows the same paradigm as the other 
members of the OmpR/PhoB family of RRs in contrast to previously proposed models 
of OmpR activation.

The response regulator OmpR oligomerizes via beta-sheets to form head-to-head 
dimers.

In Escherichia coli, the EnvZ/OmpR two-component regulatory system regulates 
expression of the porin genes ompF and ompC in response to changes in 
osmolarity. It has recently become apparent that OmpR functions as a global 
regulator, by regulating the expression of many genes in addition to the porin 
genes. OmpR consists of two domains; phosphorylation of the N-terminal receiver 
domain increases DNA binding affinity of the C-terminal domain and vice versa. 
Many response regulators including PhoB and FixJ dimerize upon phosphorylation. 
Here, we demonstrate that OmpR dimerization is stimulated by phosphorylation or 
by DNA binding. The dimerization interface revealed here was unanticipated and 
had previously not been predicted. Using the accepted head-to-tail 
tandem-binding model as a guide, we set out to examine the intermolecular 
interactions between OmpR dimers bound to DNA by protein-protein cross-linking 
methods. Surprisingly, amino acid positions that we expected to form 
cross-linked dimers did not. Conversely, positions predicted not to form dimers 
did. Because of these results, we designed a series of 23 cysteine-substituted 
OmpR mutants that were used to investigate dimer interfaces formed via the 
beta-sheet region. This four-stranded beta-sheet is a unique feature of the OmpR 
group of winged helix-turn-helix proteins. Many of the cysteine-substituted 
mutants are dominant to wild-type OmpR, are phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate 
as well as the cognate kinase EnvZ, and the cross-linked proteins are capable of 
binding to DNA. Our results are consistent with a model in which OmpR binds to 
DNA in a head-to-head orientation, in contrast to the previously proposed 
asymmetric head-to-tail model. They also raise the possibility that OmpR may be 
capable of adopting more than one orientation as it binds to a vast array of 
genes to activate or repress transcription.

Interdomain linkers of homologous response regulators determine their mechanism 
of action.

Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97201-3098, USA.

OmpR and PhoB are response regulators that contain an N-terminal phosphorylation 
domain and a C-terminal DNA binding effector domain connected by a flexible 
interdomain linker. Phosphorylation of the N terminus results in an increase in 
affinity for specific DNA and the subsequent regulation of gene expression. 
Despite their sequence and structural similarity, OmpR and PhoB employ different 
mechanisms to regulate their effector domains. Phosphorylation of OmpR in the N 
terminus stimulates the DNA binding affinity of the C terminus, whereas 
phosphorylation of the PhoB N terminus relieves inhibition of the C terminus, 
enabling it to bind to DNA. Chimeras between OmpR and PhoB containing either 
interdomain linker were constructed to explore the basis of the differences in 
their activation mechanisms. Our results indicate that effector domain 
regulation by either N terminus requires its cognate interdomain linker. In 
addition, our findings suggest that the isolated C terminus of OmpR is not 
sufficient for a productive interaction with RNA polymerase.

Roles of hilC and hilD in regulation of hilA expression in Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium.

Lucas RL(1), Lee CA.

Author information:

Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Sequences between -332 and -39 upstream of the hilA promoter are required for 
repression of hilA. An unidentified repressor is thought to bind these upstream 
repressing sequences (URS) to inhibit hilA expression. Two AraC-like 
transcriptional regulators encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1), 
HilC and HilD, bind to the URS to counteract the repression of hilA. The URS is 
required for regulation of hilA by osmolarity, oxygen, PhoP/PhoQ, and SirA/BarA. 
Here, we show that FadD, FliZ, PhoB, and EnvZ/OmpR also require the URS to 
regulate hilA. These environmental and regulatory factors may affect hilA 
expression by altering the expression or activity of HilC, HilD, or the unknown 
repressor. To begin investigating these possibilities, we tested the effects of 
environmental and regulatory factors on hilC and hilD expression. We also 
examined hilA regulation when hilC or hilD was disrupted or expressed to a high 
level. Although hilC is regulated by all environmental conditions and regulatory 
factors that modulate hilA expression, hilC is not required for the regulation 
of hilA by any conditions or factors except EnvZ/OmpR. In contrast, hilD is 
absolutely required for hilA expression, but environmental conditions and 
regulatory factors have little or no effect on hilD expression. We speculate 
that EnvZ/OmpR regulates hilA by altering the expression and/or activity of 
hilC, while all other regulatory conditions and mutations regulate hilA by 
modulating hilD posttranscriptionally. We also discuss models in which the 
regulation of hilA expression is mediated by modulation of the expression or 
activity of one or more repressors.

Inorganic polyphosphate regulates responses of Escherichia coli to nutritional 
stringencies, environmental stresses and survival in the stationary phase.

Rao NN(1), Kornberg A.

California 94305-5307, USA.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for polyP accumulation in E. coli remain 
largely obscure. Based on the available data, a tentative model is proposed 
(Fig. 1; Ault-Riché et al. 1998). Inhibition by (p)ppGpp of PPX interrupts the 
dynamic balance between the synthesis of polyP by PPK and its hydrolysis by PPX, 
accounting for polyP accumulation. However, mutants lacking PhoB, the response 
regulator of the Pho regulon, fail to accumulate polyP even in the face of high 
levels of (p)ppGpp. Clearly, PhoB is required in some undefined manner. With 
regard to osmotic stress, the pathway to polyP accumulation is also distinct 
from the one identified with the activation of envZ and the associated changes 
in membrane functions. A tentative scheme attempting to describe the metabolic 
turnover of polyP is given in Fig. 4. [figure: see text] In adaptations to 
stress, cells must coordinate major changes in the rates of transcription, 
translation, and replication as well as make choices in the genes expressed 
(Kolter et al. 1993). PolyP could provide activated phosphates or coordinate an 
adaptive response by binding metals and/or specific proteins. Accumulation of 
polyP in E. coli and other organisms is commonly assumed to provide a reservoir 
of energy convertible to ATP. This seems implausible because of the turnover of 
ATP which consumes only a fraction of a second (Chapman and Atkinson 1977). 
Thus, other functions for polyP need to be considered, among them a regulatory 
role. PolyP, even at very low levels, is essential in E. coli for adaptations in 
stationary phase and for survival (Rao and Kornberg 1996). As a polyanionic 
polymer, polyP has chemical similarities to DNA and RNA in interactions with 
basic domains of proteins. Further investigation of the cellular location of 
polyP, its state of metabolic availability and identification of its binding 
partners are needed. In view of the ubiquity of polyP in eukaryotic cells 
(including dynamic turnover in the nuclei of some mammalian cells), studies 
similar to those undertaken in E. coli may reveal comparable functions.

Involvement of the sensor kinase EnvZ in the in vivo activation of the 
response-regulator PhoB by acetyl phosphate.

Three signalling pathways lead to activation of the phosphate (Pho) regulon by 
phosphorylation of the response-regulator PhoB in Escherichia coli. One pathway 
responds to the extracellular inorganic phosphate (PI) level and leads to 
activation by the Pi sensor kinase, PhoR. The other two pathways are Pi 
independent and are apparent in the absence of PhoR. One Pi-independent pathway 
responds to the level of an unknown catabolite and leads to activation by the 
catabolite regulatory sensor kinase, CreC (originally called PhoM); the other 
Pi-independent pathway responds to acetyl phosphate and leads to activation by a 
process requiring acetyl phosphate. Here we show that activation of PhoB by 
acetyl phosphate can require the sensor kinase EnvZ. Accordingly, we propose 
that the in vivo activation of PhoB by acetyl phosphate (and perhaps other 
two-component response-regulators as well) probably always requires a certain 
kinase that can vary depending upon the growth conditions.

Cloning and identification of a two-component signal-transducing regulatory 
system from Bacteroides fragilis.

Rasmussen BA(1), Kovacs E.

Author information:
(1)Molecular Biology Section, American Cyanamid Company, Pearl River, New York, 
NY 10965.

A DNA fragment was cloned from Bacteroides fragilis that bestowed low-level 
tetracycline resistance to Escherichia coli strains harbouring the cloned 
fragment on a multicopy plasmid. The tetracycline resistance determinant was 
localized to a 4.3kb Bg/II-PstI subfragment of the original clone. DNA sequence 
analysis of this fragment revealed that it contained an operon encoding two 
proteins: one of 519 amino acids, RprX, and a second of 236 amino acids, RprY. 
Protein sequence analysis revealed that the two proteins shared sequence 
identity with a family of multicomponent signal-transducing regulatory proteins 
identified from many diverse bacterial genera. RprX shared identity with the 
first component of the regulatory system, the histidine protein kinase receptor 
(for example EnvZ, PhoR, CheA, and VirA). RprY shared identity with the second 
member of the regulatory protein pair, the regulatory response protein (for 
example OmpR, PhoB, CheY, and VirG). Expression of these proteins from a 
multicopy plasmid vector in E. coli resulted in a decrease in the level of the 
outer membrane porin protein OmpF and an increase in the level of the outer 
membrane porin protein OmpC. The decrease in OmpF levels correlates with, and 
may be the cause of, the increased tetracycline resistance. Regulation of the 
levels of OmpF and OmpC is normally controlled by a multicomponent 
signal-transducing regulatory pair of proteins, EnvZ and OmpR. The effect RprX 
and RprY have on OmpF expression is mediated at the level of transcription. 
Thus, RprX and RprY may be interfering with the normal regulation of OmpF by 
OmpR and EnvZ.

A two-component regulatory system required for copper-inducible expression of 
the copper resistance operon of Pseudomonas syringae.

92521-0122.

Specific induction of the copper resistance operon (cop) promoter from 
Pseudomonas syringae was measured by beta-galactosidase production from a cop 
promoter-lacZ fusion. Induction of the cop promoter in P. syringae pv. syringae 
required trans-acting factors from copper resistance plasmid pPT23D, from which 
cop was originally cloned. Tn5 mutagenesis of pPT23D was used to localize two 
complementation groups immediately downstream from copABCD. Cloning and 
sequencing of the DNA in this region revealed two genes, copR and copS, 
expressed in the same orientation as the cop operon but from a separate 
constitutive promoter. The amino acid sequence deduced from these genes showed 
distinct similarities to known two-component regulatory systems, including 
PhoB-PhoR and OmpR-EnvZ. In addition, CopR showed strong similarity to copper 
resistance activator protein PcoR from Escherichia coli. Functional chromosomal 
homologs to copRS activated the cop promoter, in a copper-inducible manner, in 
copper-resistant or -sensitive strains of P. syringae pv. tomato and other 
Pseudomonas species. This implies that copper-inducible gene regulation is 
associated with a common chromosomally encoded function, as well as 
plasmid-borne copper resistance, in Pseudomonas spp.

KdpD and KdpE, proteins that control expression of the kdpABC operon, are 
members of the two-component sensor-effector class of regulators.

The Kdp system of Escherichia coli, a transport ATPase with high affinity for 
potassium, is expressed when turgor pressure is low. Expression requires KdpD, a 
99-kDa membrane protein, and KdpE, a 25-kDa soluble cytoplasmic protein. The 
sequences of KdpD and KdpE show they are members of the sensor-effector class of 
regulatory proteins: the C-terminal half of KdpD is homologous to sensors such 
as EnvZ and PhoR, and KdpE is homologous to effectors such as OmpR and PhoB. The 
predicted structure of KdpD suggests that it is anchored to the membrane by four 
membrane-spanning segments near its middle, with both C- and N-terminal portions 
in the cytoplasm. Subcellular fractionation confirms the expected location of 
the protein in the inner membrane. The N-terminal region has no homology to 
known proteins and is the site of mutations that make Kdp expression partially 
constitutive; this portion may serve to sense turgor pressure. Since several 
other sensor-effectors have been shown to mediate control through 
phosphorylation, this mechanism is proposed to control expression of Kdp.

95616.

In Escherichia coli, adaptation to hyperosmotic conditions alters the expression 
of the outer membrane porins OmpF and OmpC. The amount of PhoE porin, which is 
normally induced by phosphate deprivation, was greatly reduced in cells adapted 
to high-osmolarity conditions. Osmoregulation of PhoE operated independently of 
the activity of the PhoR phosphate sensor and did not involve cross-talk from 
the homologous osmosensor EnvZ. PhoE synthesis was partially restored by 
additional copies of the positive regulator phoB+ and by the osmoprotectant 
glycine betaine.

Bacteria survive in the environment with three steps: a sensing environmental 
conditions, a responding to sensed signals, and an adaptation for proper 
survival in the environment. An adapting bacterial cell occurs cell division to 
increase the number of sister cells, termed adaptive growth. Two-component 
systems (TCSs), representing the main bacterial signal transduction systems, 
consist of a pair of one sensor kinase (SK) and one response regulator (RR), and 
RR genes are abundant in most bacterial genomes as part of the core genome. The 
OmpR gene family, a group of RR genes, is conserved in 95% of known bacterial 
genomes. The Escherichia coli genome has an estimated 34 RR genes in total, 
including 14 genes of OmpR family genes. To reveal the contribution of TCSs for 
fast growth as an adaptive growth strategy of E. coli, we isolated a set of gene 
knockout strains by using newly developed genome editing technology, the HoSeI 
(Homologous Sequence Integration) method, based on CRISPR-Cas9. The statistics 
of single cell observation show a knockout of an arbitrary pair of phoP, phoB, 
and ompR genes, stably expressed by positive feedback regulation, dramatically 
inhibit the optimum adaptive growth of E. coli. These insights suggest that the 
adaptive growth of bacteria is fulfilled by the optimum high intracellular level 
of regulators acquired during growth under environmental conditions.

In bacteria, 2-component regulatory systems (TCSs) are the critical 
information-processing pathways that link stimuli to specific adaptive 
responses. Signals perceived by membrane sensors, which are generally histidine 
kinases, are transmitted by response regulators (RRs) to allow cells to cope 
rapidly and effectively with environmental challenges. Over the past few 
decades, genes encoding components of TCSs and their responsive proteins have 
been identified, crystal structures have been described, and signaling 
mechanisms have been elucidated. Here, we review recent findings and interesting 
breakthroughs in bacterial TCS research. Furthermore, we discuss structural 
features, mechanisms of activation and regulation, and cross-regulation of RRs, 
with a focus on the largest RR family, OmpR/PhoB, to provide a comprehensive 
overview of these critically important signaling molecules.

The influence of repressor DNA binding site architecture on transcriptional 
control.

How the architecture of DNA binding sites dictates the extent of repression of 
promoters is not well understood. Here, we addressed the importance of the 
number and information content of the three direct repeats (DRs) in the binding 
and repression of the icdA promoter by the phosphorylated form of the global 
Escherichia coli repressor ArcA (ArcA-P). We show that decreasing the 
information content of the two sites with the highest information (DR1 and DR2) 
eliminated ArcA binding to all three DRs and ArcA repression of icdA. 
Unexpectedly, we also found that DR3 occupancy functions principally in 
repression, since mutation of this low-information-content site both eliminated 
DNA binding to DR3 and significantly weakened icdA repression, despite the fact 
that binding to DR1 and DR2 was intact. In addition, increasing the information 
content of any one of the three DRs or addition of a fourth DR increased 
ArcA-dependent repression but perturbed signal-dependent regulation of 
repression. Thus, our data show that the information content and number of DR 
elements are critical architectural features for maintaining a balance between 
high-affinity binding and signal-dependent regulation of icdA promoter function 
in response to changes in ArcA-P levels. Optimization of such architectural 
features may be a common strategy to either dampen or enhance the sensitivity of 
DNA binding among the members of the large OmpR/PhoB family of regulators as 
well as other transcription factors.
IMPORTANCE: In Escherichia coli, the response regulator ArcA maintains 
homeostasis of redox carriers under O2-limiting conditions through a 
comprehensive repression of carbon oxidation pathways that require aerobic 
respiration to recycle redox carriers. Although a binding site architecture 
comprised of a variable number of sequence recognition elements has been 
identified within the promoter regions of ArcA-repressed operons, it is unclear 
how this variable architecture dictates transcriptional regulation. By 
dissecting the role of multiple sequence elements within the icdA promoter, we 
provide insight into the design principles that allow ArcA to repress 
transcription within diverse promoter contexts. Our data suggest that the 
arrangement of recognition elements is tailored to achieve sufficient repression 
of a given promoter while maintaining appropriate signal-dependent regulation of 
repression, providing insight into how diverse binding site architectures link 
changes in O2 with the fine-tuning of carbon oxidation pathway levels.

ChxR is an atypical two-component signal transduction response regulator (RR) of 
the OmpR/PhoB subfamily encoded by the obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen 
Chlamydia trachomatis. Despite structural homology within both receiver and 
effector domains to prototypical subfamily members, ChxR does not require 
phosphorylation for dimer formation, DNA binding or transcriptional activation. 
Thus, we hypothesized that ChxR is in a conformation optimal for DNA binding 
with limited interdomain interactions. To address this hypothesis, the NMR 
solution structure of the ChxR effector domain was determined and used in 
combination with the previously reported ChxR receiver domain structure to 
generate a full-length dimer model based upon SAXS analysis. Small-angle 
scattering of ChxR supported a dimer with minimal interdomain interactions and 
effector domains in a conformation that appears to require only subtle 
reorientation for optimal major/minor groove DNA interactions. SAXS modeling 
also supported that the effector domains were in a head-to-tail conformation, 
consistent with ChxR recognizing tandem DNA repeats. The effector domain 
structure was leveraged to identify key residues that were critical for 
maintaining protein - nucleic acid interactions. In combination with prior 
analysis of the essential location of specific nucleotides for ChxR recognition 
of DNA, a model of the full-length ChxR dimer bound to its cognate cis-acting 
element was generated.

Two-component signal transduction systems consist of pairs of histidine kinases 
and response regulators, which mediate adaptive responses to environmental cues. 
Most activated response regulators regulate transcription by binding tightly to 
promoter DNA via a phosphorylation-triggered inactive-to-active transition. The 
molecular basis for formation of stable response regulator-DNA complexes that 
precede the assembly of RNA polymerases is unclear. Here, we present structures 
of DNA complexed with the response regulator KdpE, a member of the OmpR/PhoB 
family. The distinctively asymmetric complex in an active-like conformation 
reveals a unique intramolecular interface between the receiver domain (RD) and 
the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of only one of the two response regulators in the 
complex. Structure-function studies show that this RD-DBD interface is necessary 
to form stable complexes that support gene expression. The conservation of 
sequence and structure suggests that these findings extend to a large group of 
response regulators that act as transcription factors.

The OmpR/PhoB family of response regulators (RRs) is the largest class of 
two-component system signal transduction proteins. Extensive biochemical and 
structural characterization of these transcription factors has provided insights 
into their activation and DNA-binding mechanisms. For the most part, OmpR/PhoB 
family proteins are thought to become activated through phosphorylation from 
their cognate histidine kinase partners, which in turn facilitates an allosteric 
change in the RR, enabling homodimerization and subsequently enhanced DNA 
binding. Incongruently, it has been suggested that OmpR, the eponymous member of 
this RR family, becomes activated via different mechanisms, whereby DNA binding 
plays a central role in facilitating dimerization and phosphorylation. 
Characterization of the rate and extent of the phosphorylation of OmpR and OmpR 
DNA-binding mutants following activation of the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system 
shows that DNA binding is not essential for phosphorylation of OmpR in vivo. In 
addition, detailed analyses of the energetics of DNA binding and dimerization of 
OmpR in both its unphosphorylated and phosphorylated state indicate that 
phosphorylation enhances OmpR dimerization and that this dimerization 
enhancement is the energetic driving force for phosphorylation-mediated 
regulation of OmpR-DNA binding. These findings suggest that OmpR 
phosphorylation-mediated activation follows the same paradigm as the other 
members of the OmpR/PhoB family of RRs in contrast to previously proposed models 
of OmpR activation.

Structure-function studies of DNA binding domain of response regulator KdpE 
reveals equal affinity interactions at DNA half-sites.

Expression of KdpFABC, a K(+) pump that restores osmotic balance, is controlled 
by binding of the response regulator KdpE to a specific DNA sequence 
(kdpFABC(BS)) via the winged helix-turn-helix type DNA binding domain 
(KdpE(DBD)). Exploration of E. coli KdpE(DBD) and kdpFABC(BS) interaction 
resulted in the identification of two conserved, AT-rich 6 bp direct repeats 
that form half-sites. Despite binding to these half-sites, KdpE(DBD) was 
incapable of promoting gene expression in vivo. Structure-function studies 
guided by our 2.5 Å X-ray structure of KdpE(DBD) revealed the importance of 
residues R193 and R200 in the α-8 DNA recognition helix and T215 in the wing 
region for DNA binding. Mutation of these residues renders KdpE incapable of 
inducing expression of the kdpFABC operon. Detailed biophysical analysis of 
interactions using analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a 2∶1 stoichiometry 
of protein to DNA with dissociation constants of 200±100 and 350±100 nM at 
half-sites. Inactivation of one half-site does not influence binding at the 
other, indicating that KdpE(DBD) binds independently to the half-sites with 
approximately equal affinity and no discernable cooperativity. To our knowledge, 
these data are the first to describe in quantitative terms the binding at 
half-sites under equilibrium conditions for a member of the ubiquitous OmpR/PhoB 
family of proteins.

Our understanding of porin regulation has revealed not only increasing 
complexity in the regulatory mechanisms, but also that the porin repertoire is 
more extensive than previously conceived. Initially, the OmpR response regulator 
was described as the master regulator of porin genes, but many more regulators 
are involved such as CpxR, PhoB, Lrp, Rob, MarA, SoxS, CadC, CRP, Fnr, ToxR, 
H-NS, StpA, IHF, HU and LeuO. In addition to MicF, the first small RNA (sRNA) 
that was proposed to regulate porin expression, porins are 
post-transcriptionally regulated by a variety of other sRNAs, namely, MicC, 
MicA, IpeX, RseX, InvR, CyaR and RybB. Future challenges include the full 
integration of all the regulatory circuitries. Whether quiescent porins are 
merely replacements of the major porins or are part of novel metabolic programs 
has yet to be elucidated. The comprehensive exploration of the environmental 
determinants that affect porin gene expression should yield valuable new 
information about the functions of these important proteins.

Two-component signal transduction, featuring highly conserved histidine kinases 
(HKs) and response regulators (RRs), is one of the most prevalent signalling 
schemes in prokaryotes. RRs function as phosphorylation-activated switches to 
mediate diverse output responses, mostly via transcription regulation. As 
bacterial genomes typically encode multiple two-component proteins for distinct 
signalling pathways, the sequence and structural similarities of RR receiver 
domains create significant challenges to maintain interaction specificity. It is 
especially demanding for members of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily, the largest RR 
subfamily, which share a conserved dimerization interface for 
phosphorylation-mediated transcription regulation. We developed a strategy to 
investigate RR interaction by analysing Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) 
between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)- and yellow fluorescent protein 
(YFP)-fused RRs in vitro. Using the Escherichia coli RR PhoB as a model system, 
we were able to observe phosphorylation-dependent FRET between fluorescent 
protein (FP)-PhoB proteins and validated the FRET method by determining 
dimerization affinity and dimerization-coupled phosphorylation kinetics that 
recapitulated values determined by alternative methods. Further application of 
the FRET method to all E. coli OmpR/PhoB subfamily RRs revealed that 
phosphorylation-activated RR interaction is indeed a common theme for OmpR/PhoB 
subfamily RRs and these RRs display significant interaction specificity. Weak 
hetero-pair interactions were also identified between several different RRs, 
suggesting potential cross-regulation between distinct pathways.

Response regulators undergo regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at 
conserved aspartic acid residues in bacterial signal transduction systems. OmpR 
is a winged helix-turnhelix DNA-binding protein that functions as a global 
regulator in bacteria and is also important in pathogenesis. A detailed 
mechanistic picture of how OmpR binds to DNA and activates transcription is 
lacking. We used NMR spectroscopy to solve the solution structure of the 
C-terminal domain of OmpR (OmpR(C)) and to analyze the chemical shift changes 
that occur upon DNA binding. There is little overlap in the interaction surface 
with residues of PhoB that were reportedly involved in protein/protein 
interactions in its head-to-tail dimer. Multiple factors account for the lack of 
overlap. One is that the spacing between the OmpR half-sites is shorter than 
observed with PhoB, requiring the arrangement of the two OmpR molecules to be 
different from that of the PhoB dimer on DNA. A second is the demonstration 
herein that OmpR can bind to its high affinity site as a monomer. As a result, 
OmpR(C) appears to be capable of adopting alternative orientations depending on 
the precise base composition of the binding site, which also contributes to the 
lack of overlap. In the presence of DNA, chemical shift changes occur in OmpR in 
the recognition alpha-helix 3, the loop between beta-strand 4 and alpha-helix 1, 
and the loop between beta-strands 5 and 6. DNA contact residues are Val(203) 
(T), Arg(207) (G), and Arg(209) (phosphate backbone). Our results suggest that 
OmpR binds to DNA as a monomer and then forms a symmetric or asymmetric dimer, 
depending on the binding site. We propose that during activation OmpR binds to 
DNA and undergoes a conformational change that promotes phosphorylation of the 
N-terminal receiver domain, the receiver domains dimerize, and then the second 
monomer binds to DNA. The flexible linker of OmpR enables the second monomer to 
bind in multiple orientations (head-to-tail and head-to-head), depending on the 
specific DNA contacts.

Within the framework of an international project on the sequencing of the whole 
Bacillus subtilis genome, a 15 kb chromosome segment, which contains the iol 
operon involved in inositol utilization, has been cloned and sequenced. This 
region (14,974 bp) contains 12 complete open reading frames (ORFs; genes) and 
two partial ones; the seventh gene (E83G) is the idh gene encoding inositol 
dehydrogenase. All the genes identified are transcribed in the same direction as 
that of the movement of the replication fork. A homology search for their 
products deduced from the 12 complete ORFs revealed that eight of them exhibit 
significant homology to known proteins such as fructokinase, acetolactate 
synthase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (B. subtilis), and PhoB and FtsE 
proteins (Escherichia coli). It also implied that two genes (B65D and B65E) 
might encode a set of two-component regulatory proteins and that the B65F gene 
might encode a protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family. Based 
on the features of the nucleotide sequence determined and the results of the 
homology search, the primary structure of the iol operon is predicted.

Regulation of the phosphate regulon of Escherichia coli: analysis of mutant phoB 
and phoR genes causing different phenotypes.

The phoB gene product of Escherichia coli is the transcriptional activator for 
the genes in the phosphate regulon as well as for phoB itself, all of which are 
induced by phosphate starvation. The phoR gene product modulates PhoB function 
in response to the phosphate concentrations in the medium. We quantitatively 
compared the levels of expression of the phoA, phoB, phoE, and pstS genes in 
several phoB mutants with different phenotypes by constructing operon fusions of 
these genes with the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Although all 
the phoB mutants examined had little activator function for phoA, three among 
the four mutants showed various levels of the activator function for phoB, pstS, 
and phoE. To study the functional motifs of the PhoB and PhoR proteins, we 
cloned and sequenced the four classical phoB and six phoR mutant genes. All of 
the phoB mutations and one of the phoR mutations were missense mutations, and 
most of the altered amino acids were in the highly conserved amino acids among 
the regulatory proteins homologous to PhoB or PhoR protein, such as the OmpR, 
SfrA, and VirG proteins or the EnvZ, CpxA, and VirA proteins. The other five 
phoR mutations were nonsense mutations.

The narX and narL genes encoding the nitrate-sensing regulators of Escherichia 
coli are homologous to a family of prokaryotic two-component regulatory genes.

The nucleotide sequence of a 4.4-kilobase SacII-SspI fragment encoding the narXL 
operon and a part of the narK gene of Escherichia coli has been determined. The 
narX and narL genes encode proteins of molecular weight 67,275 and 23,927, 
respectively, and are transcribed from a common promoter, narXp, locating within 
429 bases upstream of narX. Transcription from narXp is not significantly 
induced by nitrate under anaerobiosis, whereas transcription from narK promoter, 
which overlaps narXp region and is transcribed divergently, is fully induced by 
nitrate. The N-terminal two-thirds of the NarL protein has extensive homology 
with those of a diverse set of prokaryotic regulatory proteins, including OmpR, 
PhoB, SfrA, UhpA, CheY, CheB, NtrC, DctD, FixJ, VirG, SpoOF, and SpoOA. A 
segment locating in the C-terminal half of the NarL protein seems to have 
potential most likely to form the helix-turn-helix structure characteristic of a 
class of DNA-binding protein. The protein is considered to play a role as a 
transcriptional activator of the nitrate reductase operon, narCHJI, and the narK 
gene. The C-terminal region of the NarX protein also has homology with other 
regulatory proteins known as counterparts of two-component regulatory systems, 
such as EnvZ, PhoR, PhoM, CpxA, NtrB, DctB, FixL, and VirA. Presence of two 
copies of hydrophobic segments in the N-terminal half of the NarX protein 
suggests the role as a transmembrane receptor sensing nitrate.

Deduced products of C4-dicarboxylate transport regulatory genes of Rhizobium

We have sequenced two genes dctB and dctD required for the activation of the 
C4-dicarboxylate transport structural gene dctA in free-living Rhizobium 
leguminosarum. The hydropathic profile of the dctB gene product (DctB) suggested 
that its N-terminal region may be located in the periplasm and its C-terminal 
region in the cytoplasm. The C-terminal region of DctB was strongly conserved 
with similar regions of the products of several regulatory genes that may act as 
environmental sensors, including ntrB, envZ, virA, phoR, cpxA, and phoM. The 
N-terminal domains of the products of several regulatory genes thought to be 
transcriptional activators, including ntrC, ompR, virG, phoB and sfrA. In 
addition, the central and C-terminal regions of DctD were strongly conserved 
with the products of ntrC and nifA, transcriptional activators that require the 
alternate sigma factor rpoN (ntrA) as co-activator. The central region of DctD 
also contained a potential ATP-binding domain. These results are consistent with 
recent results that show that rpoN product is required for dctA activation, and 
suggest that DctB plus DctD-mediated transcriptional activation of dctA may be 
mechanistically similar to NtrB plus NtrC-mediated activation of glnA in E. 
coli.

Two-component regulatory systems responsive to environmental stimuli share

We report that the ntrB and ntrC proteins of Bradyrhizobium sp. [Parasponia] 
strain RP501 share homology with other regulatory proteins. There is extensive 
conservation of C-terminal regions between products of RP501 ntrB; Klebsiella 
pneumoniae ntrB; Escherichia coli envZ, cpxA, and phoR; Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens virA; and, to a lesser extent, E. coli cheA. There is also extensive 
conservation of N-terminal regions between products of RP501 ntrC; K. pneumoniae 
ntrC; E. coli ompR, sfrA, phoB, cheY and cheB; Salmonella typhimurium cheB and 
cheY; Bacillus subtilis spoOA and spoOF; and A. tumefaciens virG. We propose 
that these regulatory genes comprise two-component regulatory systems that 
evolved from a common ancestral system that involved transduction of information 
about the status of the environment by one protein domain (the C-terminal 
regions conserved among ntrB, envZ, etc.) to a second one (the N-terminal region 
conserved among ntrC, ompR, etc.). The ntrC-set protein then acts upon a 
specific responding mechanism, typically as a transcriptional activator but also 
as an effector of the maturation of outer membrane proteins or as a modulator of 
the direction of flagella rotation.

Escherichia coli uses two-component systems (TCSs) to respond to environmental 
signals. TCSs affect gene expression and are parts of E. coli's global 
transcriptional regulatory network (TRN). Here, we identified the regulons of 
five TCSs in E. coli MG1655: BaeSR and CpxAR, which were stimulated by ethanol 
stress; KdpDE and PhoRB, induced by limiting potassium and phosphate, 
respectively; and ZraSR, stimulated by zinc. We analyzed RNA-seq data using 
independent component analysis (ICA). ChIP-exo data were used to validate 
condition-specific target gene binding sites. Based on these data, we do the 
following: (i) identify the target genes for each TCS; (ii) show how the target 
genes are transcribed in response to stimulus; and (iii) reveal novel 
relationships between TCSs, which indicate noncognate inducers for various 
response regulators, such as BaeR to iron starvation, CpxR to phosphate 
limitation, and PhoB and ZraR to cell envelope stress. Our understanding of the 
TRN in E. coli is thus notably expanded.IMPORTANCE E. coli is a common commensal 
microbe found in the human gut microenvironment; however, some strains cause 
diseases like diarrhea, urinary tract infections, and meningitis. E. coli's 
two-component systems (TCSs) modulate target gene expression, especially related 
to virulence, pathogenesis, and antimicrobial peptides, in response to 
environmental stimuli. Thus, it is of utmost importance to understand the 
transcriptional regulation of TCSs to infer bacterial environmental adaptation 
and disease pathogenicity. Utilizing a combinatorial approach integrating RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq), independent component analysis, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation coupled with exonuclease treatment (ChIP-exo), and data 
mining, we suggest five different modes of TCS transcriptional regulation. Our 
data further highlight noncognate inducers of TCSs, which emphasizes the 
cross-regulatory nature of TCSs in E. coli and suggests that TCSs may have a 
role beyond their cognate functionalities. In summary, these results can lead to 
an understanding of the metabolic capabilities of bacteria and correctly predict 
complex phenotype under diverse conditions, especially when further incorporated 
with genome-scale metabolic models.

Identification of UvrY as the cognate response regulator for the BarA sensor 
kinase in Escherichia coli.

BarA is a membrane-associated protein that belongs to a subclass of tripartite 
sensors of the two-component signal transduction system family. In this study, 
we report that UvrY is the cognate response regulator for BarA of Escherichia 
coli. This conclusion is based upon homologies with analogous two-component 
systems and demonstrated by both biochemical and genetic means. We show that the 
purified BarA protein is able to autophosphorylate when incubated with 
[gamma-(32)P]ATP but not with [alpha-(32)P]ATP or [gamma-(32)P]GTP. 
Phosphorylated BarA, in turn, acts as an efficient phosphoryl group donor to 
UvrY but not to the non-cognate response regulators ArcA, PhoB, or CpxR. The 
specificity of the transphosphorylation reaction is further supported by the 
fact that UvrY can receive the phosphoryl group from BarA-P but not from the 
non-cognate tripartite sensor ArcB-P or ATP. In addition, genetic evidence that 
BarA and UvrY mediate the same signal transduction pathway is provided by the 
finding that both uvrY and barA mutant strains exhibit the same hydrogen 
peroxide hypersensitive phenotype. These results provide the first biochemical 
evidence as well as genetic support for a link between BarA and UvrY, suggesting 
that the two proteins constitute a new two-component system for gene regulation 
in Escherichia coli.

stimulated the ATP-dependent translocation of precursor PhoB (prePhoB) by the B. 
subtilis SecA-SecYE complex. To systematically determine the functional 
exchangeability of translocase subunits, all of the relevant combinations of the 
E. coli and B. subtilis secY, secE, and secG genes were expressed in E. coli. 
Hybrid SecYEG complexes were overexpressed at high levels. Since SecY could not 
be overproduced without SecE, these data indicate a stable interaction between 
the heterologous SecY and SecE subunits. E. coli SecA, but not B. subtilis SecA, 
supported efficient ATP-dependent translocation of the E. coli precursor OmpA 
(proOmpA) into inner membrane vesicles containing the hybrid SecYEG complexes, 
if E. coli SecY and either E. coli SecE or E. coli SecG were present. 
Translocation of B. subtilis prePhoB, on the other hand, showed a strict 
dependence on the translocase subunit composition and occurred efficiently only 
with the homologous translocase. In contrast to E. coli SecA, B. subtilis SecA 
binds the SecYEG complexes only with low affinity. These results suggest that 
each translocase subunit contributes in an exclusive manner to the specificity 
and functionality of the complex.

Bacillus subtilis.

The nucleotide sequence of clpX, which is localized between the tig (trigger 
factor) and the lon (ATP-dependent protease) genes at 245 degrees on the 
standard Bacillus subtilis (Bs) genetic map, was determined. The putative clpX 
gene codes for a 46-kDa protein of 421 amino acid (aa) residues. A comparison of 
the deduced aa sequence with those of the recently described bacterial clpX gene 
products from Synechocystis sp., Escherichia coli (Ec), Haemophilus influenzae 
and Azotobacter vinelandii revealed strong similarities. However, in contrast to 
Ec, clpX and clpP of Bs are located at different loci on the chromosome and are 
transcribed as monocistronic genes. A heat-inducible sigma A-like promoter was 
mapped upstream of the clpX structural gene, but no CIRCE element, 
characteristic of class-I heat-shock genes (e.g., groESL and dnaK), was found 
between the transcriptional and translational start sites. Although the majority 
of the heat-inducible general stress genes in Bs are under the control of the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma B, the heat induction of clpX appears to be 
sigma B-independent. The latter indicates that clpX belongs to class-III 
heat-inducible genes.

Energy-dependent protein degradation by the AAA+ ClpXP protease helps maintain 
protein homeostasis in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles of bacterial origin. 
In Escherichia coli and many other proteobacteria, the SspB adaptor assists 
ClpXP in degrading ssrA-tagged polypeptides produced as a consequence of 
tmRNA-mediated ribosome rescue. By tethering these incomplete ssrA-tagged 
proteins to ClpXP, SspB facilitates their efficient degradation at low substrate 
concentrations. How this process occurs structurally is unknown. Here, we 
present a cryo-EM structure of the SspB adaptor bound to a GFP-ssrA substrate 
and to ClpXP. This structure provides evidence for simultaneous contacts of SspB 
and ClpX with the ssrA tag within the tethering complex, allowing direct 
substrate handoff concomitant with the initiation of substrate translocation. 
Furthermore, our structure reveals that binding of the substrate·adaptor complex 
induces unexpected conformational changes within the spiral structure of the 
AAA+ ClpX hexamer and its interaction with the ClpP tetradecamer.

ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) proteases power the 
maintenance of protein homeostasis by coupling ATP hydrolysis to mechanical 
protein unfolding, translocation, and ultimately degradation. Although ATPase 
activity drives a large portion of the mechanical work these molecular machines 
perform, how the peptidase contributes to the forceful denaturation and 
processive threading of substrates remains unknown. Here, using single-molecule 
optical trapping, we examine the mechanical activity of the caseinolytic 
peptidase P (ClpP) from Escherichia coli in the absence of a partner ATPase and 
in the presence of an activating small-molecule acyldepsipeptide. We demonstrate 
that ClpP grips protein substrate under mechanical loads exceeding 40 pN, which 
are greater than those observed for the AAA+ unfoldase ClpX and the AAA+ 
protease complexes ClpXP and ClpAP. We further characterize substrate-ClpP bond 
lifetimes and rupture forces under varying loads. We find that the resulting 
slip bond behavior does not depend on ClpP peptidase activity. In addition, we 
find that unloaded bond lifetimes between ClpP and protein substrate are on a 
timescale relevant to unfolding times (up to ∼160 s) for difficult to unfold 
model substrate proteins. These direct measurements of the substrate-peptidase 
bond under load define key properties required by AAA+ proteases to mechanically 
unfold and degrade protein substrates.

ClpX/P-Dependent Degradation of Novel Substrates in Streptococcus mutans.

Gurung V(1), Biswas I(1).

Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.

Regulated proteolysis is where AAA+ ATPases (ClpX, ClpC, and ClpE) are coupled 
to a protease subunit (ClpP) to facilitate degradation of misfolded and native 
regulatory proteins in the cell. The process is intricately linked to protein 
quality control and homeostasis and modulates several biological processes. In 
streptococci, regulated proteolysis is vital to various functions, including 
virulence expression, competence development, bacteriocin production, biofilm 
formation, and stress responses. Among the various Clp ATPases, ClpX is the 
major one that recognizes specific amino acid residues in its substrates and 
delivers them to the ClpP proteolytic chamber for degradation. While multiple 
ClpX substrates have been identified in Escherichia coli and other bacteria, 
little is known about the identity of these substrates in streptococci. Here, we 
used a preliminary proteomic analysis to identify putative ClpX substrates using 
Streptococcus mutans as a model organism. SMU.961 is one such putative substrate 
where we identified the Glu-Lue-Gln (ELQ) motif at the C terminus that is 
recognized by ClpX/P. We identified several other proteins, including MecA, 
which also harbor ELQ and are degraded by ClpX/P. This is surprising since MecA 
is known to be degraded by ClpC/P in Bacillus subtilis; however, ClpX/P-mediated 
MecA degradation is unknown. We also identified Glu and Gln as the crucial 
residues for ClpX recognition. Our data indicate a species and perhaps 
strain-specific recognition of ELQ by streptococcal ClpX/P. At present, we do 
not know whether this species-dependent degradation by ClpX/P is unique to S. 
mutans, and we are currently examining the phenomenon in other pathogenic 
streptococci. IMPORTANCE ClpX/P is a major intracellular proteolytic complex 
that is responsible for protein quality control in the cell. ClpX, an AAA+ 
ATPase, distinguishes the potential substrates by recognizing short motifs at 
the C-terminal end of proteins and delivers the substrates for degradation by 
ClpP protease. The identity of these ClpX substrates, which varies greatly among 
bacteria, is known only for a few well-studied species. Here, we used 
Streptococcus mutans as a model organism to identify ClpX substrates. We found 
that a short motif of three residues is successfully recognized by ClpX/P. 
Interestingly, the motif is not present at the ultimate C-terminal end; rather 
it is present close to the end. This result suggests that streptococcal ClpX 
ATPase can recognize internal motifs.

Streptococcus mutans, a dental pathogen, harbors at least three Clp ATPases 
(ClpC, ClpE, and ClpX) that form complexes with ClpP protease and participate in 
regulated proteolysis. Among these, the function of ClpE ATPase is poorly 
understood. We have utilized an isogenic clpE-deficient strain derived from S. 
mutans UA159 and evaluated the role of ClpE in cellular physiology. We found 
that loss of ClpE leads to increased susceptibility against thiol stress but not 
to oxidative and thermal stress. Furthermore, we found that the mutant displays 
altered tolerance against some antibiotics and altered biofilm formation. We 
performed a label-free proteomic analysis by comparing the mutant with the 
wild-type UA159 strain under nonstressed conditions and found that ClpE 
modulates a relatively limited proteome in the cell compared to the proteomes 
modulated by ClpX and ClpP. Nevertheless, we found that ClpE deficiency leads to 
an overabundance of some cell wall synthesis enzymes, ribosomal proteins, and an 
unknown protease encoded by SMU.2153. Our proteomic data strongly support some 
of the stress-related phenotypes that we observed. Our study emphasizes the 
significance of ClpE in the physiology of S. mutans. IMPORTANCE When bacteria 
encounter environmental stresses, the expression of various proteins 
collectively known as heat shock proteins is induced. These heat shock proteins 
are necessary for cell survival specifically under conditions that induce 
protein denaturation. A subset of heat shock proteins known as the Clp 
proteolytic complex is required for the degradation of the misfolded proteins in 
the cell. The Clp proteolytic complex contains an ATPase and a protease. A 
specific Clp ATPase, ClpE, is uniquely present in Gram-positive bacteria, 
including streptococci. Here, we have studied the functional role of the ClpE 
protein in Streptococcus mutans, a dental pathogen. Our results suggest that 
ClpE is required for survival under certain antibiotic exposure and stress 
conditions but not others. Our results demonstrate that loss of ClpE leads to a 
significantly altered cellular proteome, and the analysis of those changes 
suggests that ClpE's functions in S. mutans are different from its functions in 
other Gram-positive bacteria.

The ssrA degron is commonly used in fusion proteins to control protein stability 
in bacteria or as an interaction module. These applications often rely on the 
modular activities of the ssrA tag in binding to the SspB adaptor and in 
engaging the ClpXP protease. However, a comparison of these activities for a 
substantial standard set of degron variants has not been conducted previously, 
which may hinder the development of new variants optimized exclusively for one 
application. Here, we strive to establish a benchmark that will facilitate the 
comparison of ssrA variants under uniform conditions. In our workflow, we 
included methods for expression and purification of ClpX, ClpP, SspB and 
eGFP-degrons, assays of ClpX ATPase activity, of eGFP-degron binding to SspB and 
for measuring eGFP-degron degradation in vitro and in vivo. Using uniform, 
precise and sensitive methods under the same conditions on a range of 
eGFP-degrons allowed us to determine subtle differences in their properties that 
can affect their potential applications. Our findings can serve as a reference 
and a resource for developing targeted protein degradation approaches.

Bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are composed of a deleterious toxin and 
its antagonistic antitoxin. They are widespread in bacterial genomes and mobile 
genetic elements, and their functions remain largely unknown. Some TA systems, 
known as TAC modules, include a cognate SecB-like chaperone that assists the 
antitoxin in toxin inhibition. Here, we have investigated the involvement of 
proteases in the activation cycle of the TAC system of the human pathogen 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We show that the deletion of endogenous AAA+ 
proteases significantly bypasses the need for a dedicated chaperone and identify 
the mycobacterial ClpXP1P2 complex as the main protease involved in TAC 
antitoxin degradation. In addition, we show that the ClpXP1P2 degron is located 
at the extreme C-terminal end of the chaperone addiction (ChAD) region of the 
antitoxin, demonstrating that ChAD functions as a hub for both chaperone binding 
and recognition by proteases.

ClpXP in Escherichia coli is a proteasome degrading protein substrates. It 
consists of one hexamer of ATPase (ClpX) and two heptamers of peptidase (ClpP). 
The ClpX binds ATP and translocates the substrate protein into the ClpP chamber 
by binding and hydrolysis of ATP. At single molecular level, ClpX harnesses 
cycles of power stroke (dwell and burst) to unfold the substrates, then releases 
the ADP and Pi. Based on the construction and function of ClpXP, especially the 
recent progress on how ClpX unfold protein substrates, in this mini-review, a 
currently proposed single ClpX molecular model system detected by optical 
tweezers, and its prospective for the elucidation of the mechanism of force 
generation of ClpX in its power stroke and the subunit interaction with each 
other, were discussed in detail.

MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to 
pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together 
with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to 
midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing 
FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent 
bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation 
reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal 
region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that 
ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is 
a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest 
that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and 
MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored 
copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that 
ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation 
by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the 
ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, 
these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational 
assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of 
reduced proliferation.

AAA+ proteases perform regulated protein degradation in all kingdoms of life and 
consist of a hexameric AAA+ unfoldase/translocase in complex with a 
self-compartmentalized peptidase. Based on asymmetric features of cryo-EM 
structures and a sequential hand-over-hand model of substrate translocation, 
recent publications have proposed that the AAA+ unfoldases ClpA and ClpX rotate 
with respect to their partner peptidase ClpP to allow function. Here, we test 
this model by covalently crosslinking ClpA to ClpP to prevent rotation. We find 
that crosslinked ClpAP complexes unfold, translocate, and degrade protein 
substrates in vitro, albeit modestly slower than uncrosslinked enzyme controls. 
Rotation of ClpA with respect to ClpP is therefore not required for ClpAP 
protease activity, although some flexibility in how the AAA+ ring docks with 
ClpP may be necessary for optimal function.

Members of the genus Shigella carry a large plasmid, pINV, which is essential 
for virulence. In Shigella flexneri, pINV harbours three toxin-antitoxin (TA) 
systems, CcdAB, GmvAT and VapBC that promote vertical transmission of the 
plasmid. Type II TA systems, such as those on pINV, consist of a toxic protein 
and protein antitoxin. Selective degradation of the antitoxin by proteases leads 
to the unopposed action of the toxin once genes encoding a TA system have been 
lost, such as following failure to inherit a plasmid harbouring a TA system. 
Here, we investigate the role of proteases in the function of the pINV TA 
systems and demonstrate that Lon, but not ClpP, is required for their activity 
during plasmid stability. This provides the first evidence that 
acetyltransferase family TA systems, such as GmvAT, can be regulated by Lon. 
Interestingly, S. flexneri pINV also harbours two putative partitioning systems, 
ParAB and StbAB. We show that both systems are functional for plasmid 
maintenance although their activity is masked by other systems on pINV. Using a 
model vector based on the pINV replicon, we observe temperature-dependent 
differences between the two partitioning systems that contribute to our 
understanding of the maintenance of virulence in Shigella species.

The activity of type II toxin-antitoxin systems (TA), which are responsible for 
many important features of bacterial cells, is based on the differences between 
toxin and antitoxin stabilities. The antitoxin lability results from bacterial 
protease activity. Here, we investigated how particular Escherichia coli 
cytosolic proteases, namely, Lon, ClpAP, ClpXP, and ClpYQ, affect the stability 
of both the toxin and antitoxin components of the parDE system from the broad 
host range plasmid RK2. The results of our in vivo and in vitro experiments show 
that the ParD antitoxin is degraded by the ClpAP protease, and dsDNA stimulates 
this process. The ParE toxin is not degraded by any of these proteases and can 
therefore cause growth inhibition of plasmid-free cells after an unequal plasmid 
distribution during cell division. We also demonstrate that the ParE toxin 
interaction with ParD prevents antitoxin proteolysis by ClpAP; however, this 
interaction does not prevent the ClpAP interaction with ParD. We show that ClpAP 
protease homologs affect plasmid stability in other bacterial species, 
indicating that ClpAP is a universal activator of the parDE system and that ParD 
is a universal substrate for ClpAP.

Analyses of mutations in rpoB subunit of Escherichia coli that lead to 
resistance to rifampicin have been invaluable in providing insight into events 
during transcription continue to be discovered. Earlier we reported that rpoB12 
suppresses over-expression of cps genes in Δlon mutant of E. coli, by 
interfering with the transcription of rcsA. Here we report Microarray based 
Transcriptome profile of Δlon and Δlon rpoB12 strains. The data analyses clearly 
reveal that rpoB12 mutation results in the differential expression of ∼450 
genes. The transcription profiles of some of the genes namely, rcsA, gadE, csgD, 
bolA, ypdI, dnaJ, clpP, csrA and hdeA are significantly altered, particularly 
the genes implicated in virulence. Some of the phenotypic traits namely, biofilm 
formation, motility, curli synthesis and ability to withstand acidic stress in a 
lon+rpoB12 strain were assessed. The results clearly indicate that rpoB12 
up-regulates biofilm formation and curli synthesis while it makes the cells 
sensitive for growth in acidic medium and inhibits motility almost completely. 
Furthermore, rpoB12 modulates the expression profile of a significant number of 
genes involved in stress responses, genes encoding small RNAs. Thus, this study 
reveals the versatile role of the rpoB12 mutation, especially its impact on the 
regulation of genes related to virulence and highlights its medical importance.

Cells possess protein quality control mechanisms to maintain proper cellular 
homeostasis. In eukaryotes, the roles of the ubiquitination and 
proteasome-mediated degradation of cellular proteins is well established. Recent 
studies have elucidated protein tagging mechanisms in prokaryotes, involving 
transfer messenger RNA (tmRNA) and pupylation. In this review, newer insights 
and bioinformatics analysis of two distinct bacterial protein tagging 
machineries are discussed. The machinery for tmRNAmediated tagging is present in 
several eubacterial representatives, e.g. Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis, Bacillus subtilis etc., but not in two archaeal representatives, 
such as Thermoplasma acidophilum and Sulfolobus solfataricus. On the other hand, 
the machinery involving tagging with the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein 
(Pup) is absent in most bacteria but is encoded in some eubacterial 
representatives, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. 
Furthermore, molecular details on the relationship between protein tagging and 
enzymes involved in protein degradation in bacteria during infection are 
emerging. Several pathogenic bacteria that do not express the major 
ATP-dependent proteases, Lon and Caseinolytic protease (ClpP), are avirulent. 
Also, some ATP-independent peptidases, such as PepA and PepN, modulate the 
infection process. The roles of bacterial proteins involved in tagging and 
degradation during infection are discussed. These aspects add a new dimension to 
better understanding of the peculiarities of host-pathogen interactions.

Specific nucleoprotein complexes are formed strictly to prevent over-initiation 
of DNA replication. An example of those is the so-called handcuff complex, in 
which two plasmid molecules are coupled together with plasmid-encoded 
replication initiation protein (Rep). In this work, we elucidate the mechanism 
of the handcuff complex disruption. In vitro tests, including dissociation 
progress analysis, demonstrate that the dimeric variants of plasmid RK2 
replication initiation protein TrfA are involved in assembling the plasmid 
handcuff complex which, as we found, reveals high stability. Particular 
proteases, namely Lon and ClpAP, disrupt the handcuff by degrading TrfA, thus 
affecting plasmid stability. Moreover, our data demonstrate that TrfA monomers 
are able to dissociate handcuffed plasmid molecules. Those monomers displace 
TrfA molecules, which are involved in handcuff formation, and through 
interaction with the uncoupled plasmid replication origins they re-initiate DNA 
synthesis. We discuss the relevance of both Rep monomers and host proteases for 
plasmid maintenance under vegetative and stress conditions.

Toxin-antitoxin systems are ubiquitous in nature and present on the chromosomes 
of both bacteria and archaea. MazEF is a type II toxin-antitoxin system present 
on the chromosome of Escherichia coli and other bacteria. Whether MazEF is 
involved in programmed cell death or reversible growth inhibition and bacterial 
persistence is a matter of debate. In the present work the role of MazF in 
bacterial physiology was studied by using an inactive, active-site mutant of 
MazF, E24A, to activate WT MazF expression from its own promoter. The ectopic 
expression of E24A MazF in a strain containing WT mazEF resulted in reversible 
growth arrest. Normal growth resumed on inhibiting the expression of E24A MazF. 
MazF-mediated growth arrest resulted in an increase in survival of bacterial 
cells during antibiotic stress. This was studied by activation of mazEF either 
by overexpression of an inactive, active-site mutant or pre-exposure to a 
sublethal dose of antibiotic. The MazF-mediated persistence phenotype was found 
to be independent of RecA and dependent on the presence of the ClpP and Lon 
proteases. This study confirms the role of MazEF in reversible growth inhibition 
and persistence.

E. coli ClpA catalyzed polypeptide translocation is allosterically controlled by 
the protease ClpP.

Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35294-1240, USA.

There are five known ATP-dependent proteases in Escherichia coli (Lon, ClpAP, 
ClpXP, HslUV, and the membrane-associated FtsH) that catalyze the removal of 
both misfolded and properly folded proteins in cellular protein quality control 
pathways. Hexameric ClpA rings associate with one or both faces of the 
cylindrically shaped tetradecameric ClpP protease. ClpA catalyzes unfolding and 
translocation of polypeptide substrates into the proteolytic core of ClpP for 
degradation through repeated cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis at two 
nucleotide binding domains on each ClpA monomer. We previously reported a 
molecular mechanism for ClpA catalyzed polypeptide translocation in the absence 
of ClpP, including elementary rate constants, overall rate, and the kinetic step 
size. However, the potential allosteric effect of ClpP on the mechanism of ClpA 
catalyzed translocation remains unclear. Using single-turnover fluorescence 
stopped-flow methods, here we report that ClpA, when associated with ClpP, 
translocates polypeptide with an overall rate of ~35 aa s(-1) and, on average, 
traverses ~5 aa between two rate-limiting steps with reduced cooperativity 
between ATP binding sites in the hexameric ring. This is in direct contrast to 
our previously reported observation that, in the absence of ClpP, ClpA 
translocates polypeptide substrates with a maximum translocation rate of ~20 aa 
s(-1) with cooperativity between ATPase sites. Our results demonstrate that ClpP 
allosterically impacts the polypeptide translocation activity of ClpA by 
reducing the cooperativity between ATP binding sites.

Transcriptional cross-activation between toxin-antitoxin systems of Escherichia 
coli.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are formed by potent 
regulatory or suicide factors (toxins) and their short-lived inhibitors 
(antitoxins). Antitoxins are DNA-binding proteins and auto-repress transcription 
of TA operons. Transcription of multiple TA operons is activated in temporarily 
non-growing persister cells that can resist killing by antibiotics. 
Consequently, the antitoxin levels of persisters must have been dropped and 
toxins are released of inhibition.
RESULTS: Here, we describe transcriptional cross-activation between different TA 
systems of Escherichia coli. We find that the chromosomal relBEF operon is 
activated in response to production of the toxins MazF, MqsR, HicA, and HipA. 
Expression of the RelE toxin in turn induces transcription of several TA 
operons. We show that induction of mazEF during amino acid starvation depends on 
relBE and does not occur in a relBEF deletion mutant. Induction of TA operons 
has been previously shown to depend on Lon protease which is activated by 
polyphospate accumulation. We show that transcriptional cross-activation occurs 
also in strains deficient for Lon, ClpP, and HslV proteases and polyphosphate 
kinase. Furthermore, we find that toxins cleave the TA mRNA in vivo, which is 
followed by degradation of the antitoxin-encoding fragments and selective 
accumulation of the toxin-encoding regions. We show that these accumulating 
fragments can be translated to produce more toxin.
CONCLUSION: Transcriptional activation followed by cleavage of the mRNA and 
disproportionate production of the toxin constitutes a possible positive 
feedback loop, which can fire other TA systems and cause bistable growth 
heterogeneity. Cross-interacting TA systems have a potential to form a complex 
network of mutually activating regulators in bacteria.

Differential stability of toxins and antitoxins is the key for the conditional 
activation and function of Toxin-Antitoxin systems. Here we report the 
evaluation of the action of cell proteases Lon, ClpAP, ClpXP and ClpYQ on the 
Kis antitoxin and the Kid toxin of the parD TA system of plasmid R1. In vitro 
analysis shows that Kis antitoxin, but not the Kid toxin, is cleaved 
specifically by the ClpAP protease. The Kid toxin is not cleaved either by this 
protease or by any of the others cell proteases tested but in complex with the 
Kis antitoxin protects the cleavage of this protein in a way that is dependent 
on the toxin-antitoxin ratio. We further show that this protection is correlated 
with the inability of the ClpA chaperone to access the Kis antitoxin when in 
complex with Kid toxin. The stability of the antitoxin greatly increases in vivo 
in a clpP- background and plasmid maintenance mediated by the parD system, which 
is dependent on the differential decay of the antitoxin, is reduced to the 
levels observed in the absence of a functional toxin. The functional 
implications of these data are further discussed within the frame of the 
regulation of the parD system and of the available information on the nature of 
the toxin-antitoxin complexes formed at different toxin-antitoxin ratios.

Accumulation of sigmaS due to enhanced synthesis and decreased degradation in 
acidic phospholipid-deficient Escherichia coli cells.

and Engineering, Saitama University, Saitama, Japan.

The Escherichia coli pgsA3 mutation, which causes deficiency in acidic 
phospholipids, leads to a significant accumulation of sigma(S). This 
accumulation is partly accounted for by the higher transcription level of rpoS; 
however, it has also been suggested that the cells accumulate sigma(S) 
post-transcriptionally. We found that the level of the small regulatory RNA 
RprA, which is involved in the promotion of rpoS translation, is higher in pgsA3 
cells than in pgsA(+) cells. Induction of altered rpoS mRNA that does not depend 
on RprA in pgsA(+) cells did not increase the level of sigma(S) to the high 
level observed in pgsA3 cells, suggesting post-translational sigma(S) 
accumulation in the latter. The mRNA levels of clpX and clpP, whose products 
form a ClpXP protease that degrades sigma(S), were much reduced in pgsA3 cells. 
Consistent with the reduced mRNA levels, the half-life of sigma(S) in pgsA3 
cells was much longer than in pgsA(+) cells, indicating that downregulation of 
the degradation is a major cause for the high sigma(S) content. We show that the 
downregulation can be partially attributed to activated CpxAR in the mutant 
cells, which causes repression of rpoE on whose gene product the expression of 
clpPX depends.

Transcriptional analysis of dynamic heat-shock response by the hyperthermophilic 
bacterium Thermotoga maritima.

The thermal stress response of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga 
maritima was characterized using a 407-open reading frame-targeted cDNA 
microarray. Transient gene expression was followed for 90 min, following a shift 
from 80 degrees C to 90 degrees C. While some aspects of mesophilic heat-shock 
response were conserved in T. maritima, genome content suggested differentiating 
features that were borne out by transcriptional analysis. Early induction of 
predicted heat-shock operons hrcA-grpE-dnaJ (TM0851-TM0850-TM0849), groES-groEL 
(TM0505-TM0506), and dnaK-sHSP (TM0373-TM0374) was consistent with conserved 
CIRCE elements upstream of hrcA and groES. Induction of the T. maritima rpoE/ 
sigW and rpoD/ sigA homologs suggests a mechanism for global heat-shock response 
in the absence of an identifiable ortholog to a major heat-shock sigma factor. 
In contrast to heat-shock response in Escherichia coli, the majority of genes 
encoding ATP-dependent proteases were downregulated, including clpP (TM0695), 
clpQ (TM0521), clpY (TM0522), lonA (TM1633), and lonB (TM1869). Notably, T. 
maritima showed indications of a late heat-shock response with the induction of 
a marR homolog (TM0816), several other putative transcriptional regulators 
(TM1023, TM1069), and two alpha-glucosidases (TM0434 and TM1068). Taken 
together, the results reported here indicate that, while T. maritima shares core 
elements of the bacterial heat-shock response with mesophiles, the thermal 
stress regulatory strategies of this organism differ significantly. However, it 
remains to be elucidated whether these differences are related to 
thermophilicity or phylogenetic placement.

A functional association is uncovered between the ribosome-associated trigger 
factor (TF) chaperone and the ClpXP degradation complex. Bioinformatic analyses 
demonstrate conservation of the close proximity of tig, the gene coding for TF, 
and genes coding for ClpXP, suggesting a functional interaction. The effect of 
TF on ClpXP-dependent degradation varies based on the nature of substrate. While 
degradation of some substrates are slowed down or are unaffected by TF, 
surprisingly, TF increases the degradation rate of a third class of substrates. 
These include λ phage replication protein λO, master regulator of stationary 
phase RpoS, and SsrA-tagged proteins. Globally, TF acts to enhance the 
degradation of about 2% of newly synthesized proteins. TF is found to interact 
through multiple sites with ClpX in a highly dynamic fashion to promote protein 
degradation. This chaperone-protease cooperation constitutes a unique and likely 
ancestral aspect of cellular protein homeostasis in which TF acts as an adaptor 
for ClpXP.

Using degenerated primers from conserved regions of previously studied clpX gene 
products, we cloned the clpX gene of the malolactic bacterium Oenococcus oeni. 
The clpX gene was sequenced, and the deduced protein of 413 amino acids 
(predicted molecular mass of 45,650 Da) was highly similar to previously 
analyzed clpX gene products from other organisms. An open reading frame located 
upstream of the clpX gene was identified as the tig gene by similarity of its 
predicted product to other bacterial trigger factors. ClpX was purified by using 
a maltose binding protein fusion system and was shown to possess an ATPase 
activity. Northern analyses indicated the presence of two independent 1.6-kb 
monocistronic clpX and tig mRNAs and also showed an increase in clpX mRNA amount 
after a temperature shift from 30 to 42 degrees C. The clpX transcript is 
abundant in the early exponential growth phase and progressively declines to 
undetectable levels in the stationary phase. Thus, unlike hsp18, the gene 
encoding one of the major small heat shock proteins of Oenococcus oeni, clpX 
expression is related to the exponential growth phase and requires de novo 
protein synthesis. Primer extension analysis identified the 5' end of clpX mRNA 
which is located 408 nucleotides upstream of a putative AUA start codon. The 
putative transcription start site allowed identification of a predicted promoter 
sequence with a high similarity to the consensus sequence found in the 
housekeeping gene promoter of gram-positive bacteria as well as Escherichia 
coli.

The nucleotide sequence of clpX, which is localized between the tig (trigger 
factor) and the lon (ATP-dependent protease) genes at 245 degrees on the 
standard Bacillus subtilis (Bs) genetic map, was determined. The putative clpX 
gene codes for a 46-kDa protein of 421 amino acid (aa) residues. A comparison of 
the deduced aa sequence with those of the recently described bacterial clpX gene 
products from Synechocystis sp., Escherichia coli (Ec), Haemophilus influenzae 
and Azotobacter vinelandii revealed strong similarities. However, in contrast to 
Ec, clpX and clpP of Bs are located at different loci on the chromosome and are 
transcribed as monocistronic genes. A heat-inducible sigma A-like promoter was 
mapped upstream of the clpX structural gene, but no CIRCE element, 
characteristic of class-I heat-shock genes (e.g., groESL and dnaK), was found 
between the transcriptional and translational start sites. Although the majority 
of the heat-inducible general stress genes in Bs are under the control of the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma B, the heat induction of clpX appears to be 
sigma B-independent. The latter indicates that clpX belongs to class-III 
heat-inducible genes.

Energy-dependent protein degradation by the AAA+ ClpXP protease helps maintain 
protein homeostasis in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles of bacterial origin. 
In Escherichia coli and many other proteobacteria, the SspB adaptor assists 
ClpXP in degrading ssrA-tagged polypeptides produced as a consequence of 
tmRNA-mediated ribosome rescue. By tethering these incomplete ssrA-tagged 
proteins to ClpXP, SspB facilitates their efficient degradation at low substrate 
concentrations. How this process occurs structurally is unknown. Here, we 
present a cryo-EM structure of the SspB adaptor bound to a GFP-ssrA substrate 
and to ClpXP. This structure provides evidence for simultaneous contacts of SspB 
and ClpX with the ssrA tag within the tethering complex, allowing direct 
substrate handoff concomitant with the initiation of substrate translocation. 
Furthermore, our structure reveals that binding of the substrate·adaptor complex 
induces unexpected conformational changes within the spiral structure of the 
AAA+ ClpX hexamer and its interaction with the ClpP tetradecamer.

other stress-inducible molecular chaperones. While the vast majority of 
ATP-dependent molecular chaperones promote the folding of either the nascent

ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) proteases power the 
maintenance of protein homeostasis by coupling ATP hydrolysis to mechanical 
protein unfolding, translocation, and ultimately degradation. Although ATPase 
activity drives a large portion of the mechanical work these molecular machines 
perform, how the peptidase contributes to the forceful denaturation and 
processive threading of substrates remains unknown. Here, using single-molecule 
optical trapping, we examine the mechanical activity of the caseinolytic 
peptidase P (ClpP) from Escherichia coli in the absence of a partner ATPase and 
in the presence of an activating small-molecule acyldepsipeptide. We demonstrate 
that ClpP grips protein substrate under mechanical loads exceeding 40 pN, which 
are greater than those observed for the AAA+ unfoldase ClpX and the AAA+ 
protease complexes ClpXP and ClpAP. We further characterize substrate-ClpP bond 
lifetimes and rupture forces under varying loads. We find that the resulting 
slip bond behavior does not depend on ClpP peptidase activity. In addition, we 
find that unloaded bond lifetimes between ClpP and protein substrate are on a 
timescale relevant to unfolding times (up to ∼160 s) for difficult to unfold 
model substrate proteins. These direct measurements of the substrate-peptidase 
bond under load define key properties required by AAA+ proteases to mechanically 
unfold and degrade protein substrates.

ClpX/P-Dependent Degradation of Novel Substrates in Streptococcus mutans.

Gurung V(1), Biswas I(1).

Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.

Regulated proteolysis is where AAA+ ATPases (ClpX, ClpC, and ClpE) are coupled 
to a protease subunit (ClpP) to facilitate degradation of misfolded and native 
regulatory proteins in the cell. The process is intricately linked to protein 
quality control and homeostasis and modulates several biological processes. In 
streptococci, regulated proteolysis is vital to various functions, including 
virulence expression, competence development, bacteriocin production, biofilm 
formation, and stress responses. Among the various Clp ATPases, ClpX is the 
major one that recognizes specific amino acid residues in its substrates and 
delivers them to the ClpP proteolytic chamber for degradation. While multiple 
ClpX substrates have been identified in Escherichia coli and other bacteria, 
little is known about the identity of these substrates in streptococci. Here, we 
used a preliminary proteomic analysis to identify putative ClpX substrates using 
Streptococcus mutans as a model organism. SMU.961 is one such putative substrate 
where we identified the Glu-Lue-Gln (ELQ) motif at the C terminus that is 
recognized by ClpX/P. We identified several other proteins, including MecA, 
which also harbor ELQ and are degraded by ClpX/P. This is surprising since MecA 
is known to be degraded by ClpC/P in Bacillus subtilis; however, ClpX/P-mediated 
MecA degradation is unknown. We also identified Glu and Gln as the crucial 
residues for ClpX recognition. Our data indicate a species and perhaps 
strain-specific recognition of ELQ by streptococcal ClpX/P. At present, we do 
not know whether this species-dependent degradation by ClpX/P is unique to S. 
mutans, and we are currently examining the phenomenon in other pathogenic 
streptococci. IMPORTANCE ClpX/P is a major intracellular proteolytic complex 
that is responsible for protein quality control in the cell. ClpX, an AAA+ 
ATPase, distinguishes the potential substrates by recognizing short motifs at 
the C-terminal end of proteins and delivers the substrates for degradation by 
ClpP protease. The identity of these ClpX substrates, which varies greatly among 
bacteria, is known only for a few well-studied species. Here, we used 
Streptococcus mutans as a model organism to identify ClpX substrates. We found 
that a short motif of three residues is successfully recognized by ClpX/P. 
Interestingly, the motif is not present at the ultimate C-terminal end; rather 
it is present close to the end. This result suggests that streptococcal ClpX 
ATPase can recognize internal motifs.

Streptococcus mutans, a dental pathogen, harbors at least three Clp ATPases 
(ClpC, ClpE, and ClpX) that form complexes with ClpP protease and participate in 
regulated proteolysis. Among these, the function of ClpE ATPase is poorly 
understood. We have utilized an isogenic clpE-deficient strain derived from S. 
mutans UA159 and evaluated the role of ClpE in cellular physiology. We found 
that loss of ClpE leads to increased susceptibility against thiol stress but not 
to oxidative and thermal stress. Furthermore, we found that the mutant displays 
altered tolerance against some antibiotics and altered biofilm formation. We 
performed a label-free proteomic analysis by comparing the mutant with the 
wild-type UA159 strain under nonstressed conditions and found that ClpE 
modulates a relatively limited proteome in the cell compared to the proteomes 
modulated by ClpX and ClpP. Nevertheless, we found that ClpE deficiency leads to 
an overabundance of some cell wall synthesis enzymes, ribosomal proteins, and an 
unknown protease encoded by SMU.2153. Our proteomic data strongly support some 
of the stress-related phenotypes that we observed. Our study emphasizes the 
significance of ClpE in the physiology of S. mutans. IMPORTANCE When bacteria 
encounter environmental stresses, the expression of various proteins 
collectively known as heat shock proteins is induced. These heat shock proteins 
are necessary for cell survival specifically under conditions that induce 
protein denaturation. A subset of heat shock proteins known as the Clp 
proteolytic complex is required for the degradation of the misfolded proteins in 
the cell. The Clp proteolytic complex contains an ATPase and a protease. A 
specific Clp ATPase, ClpE, is uniquely present in Gram-positive bacteria, 
including streptococci. Here, we have studied the functional role of the ClpE 
protein in Streptococcus mutans, a dental pathogen. Our results suggest that 
ClpE is required for survival under certain antibiotic exposure and stress 
conditions but not others. Our results demonstrate that loss of ClpE leads to a 
significantly altered cellular proteome, and the analysis of those changes 
suggests that ClpE's functions in S. mutans are different from its functions in 
other Gram-positive bacteria.

The ssrA degron is commonly used in fusion proteins to control protein stability 
in bacteria or as an interaction module. These applications often rely on the 
modular activities of the ssrA tag in binding to the SspB adaptor and in 
engaging the ClpXP protease. However, a comparison of these activities for a 
substantial standard set of degron variants has not been conducted previously, 
which may hinder the development of new variants optimized exclusively for one 
application. Here, we strive to establish a benchmark that will facilitate the 
comparison of ssrA variants under uniform conditions. In our workflow, we 
included methods for expression and purification of ClpX, ClpP, SspB and 
eGFP-degrons, assays of ClpX ATPase activity, of eGFP-degron binding to SspB and 
for measuring eGFP-degron degradation in vitro and in vivo. Using uniform, 
precise and sensitive methods under the same conditions on a range of 
eGFP-degrons allowed us to determine subtle differences in their properties that 
can affect their potential applications. Our findings can serve as a reference 
and a resource for developing targeted protein degradation approaches.

Bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are composed of a deleterious toxin and 
its antagonistic antitoxin. They are widespread in bacterial genomes and mobile 
genetic elements, and their functions remain largely unknown. Some TA systems, 
known as TAC modules, include a cognate SecB-like chaperone that assists the 
antitoxin in toxin inhibition. Here, we have investigated the involvement of 
proteases in the activation cycle of the TAC system of the human pathogen 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We show that the deletion of endogenous AAA+ 
proteases significantly bypasses the need for a dedicated chaperone and identify 
the mycobacterial ClpXP1P2 complex as the main protease involved in TAC 
antitoxin degradation. In addition, we show that the ClpXP1P2 degron is located 
at the extreme C-terminal end of the chaperone addiction (ChAD) region of the 
antitoxin, demonstrating that ChAD functions as a hub for both chaperone binding 
and recognition by proteases.

ClpXP in Escherichia coli is a proteasome degrading protein substrates. It 
consists of one hexamer of ATPase (ClpX) and two heptamers of peptidase (ClpP). 
The ClpX binds ATP and translocates the substrate protein into the ClpP chamber 
by binding and hydrolysis of ATP. At single molecular level, ClpX harnesses 
cycles of power stroke (dwell and burst) to unfold the substrates, then releases 
the ADP and Pi. Based on the construction and function of ClpXP, especially the 
recent progress on how ClpX unfold protein substrates, in this mini-review, a 
currently proposed single ClpX molecular model system detected by optical 
tweezers, and its prospective for the elucidation of the mechanism of force 
generation of ClpX in its power stroke and the subunit interaction with each 
other, were discussed in detail.

MinD is a cell division ATPase in Escherichia coli that oscillates from pole to 
pole and regulates the spatial position of the cell division machinery. Together 
with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to 
midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing 
FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent 
bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation 
reactions in vitro and in vivo through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal 
region. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that 
ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. ClpXP is 
a major regulator of growth phase-dependent proteins, and these results suggest 
that MinD levels are also controlled during stationary phase. In vitro, MinC and 
MinD are known to coassemble into linear polymers; therefore, we monitored 
copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that 
ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer destabilization and direct MinD degradation 
by ClpXP. The N terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the 
ATP-binding site in sequence, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, 
these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational 
assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of 
reduced proliferation.

AAA+ proteases perform regulated protein degradation in all kingdoms of life and 
consist of a hexameric AAA+ unfoldase/translocase in complex with a 
self-compartmentalized peptidase. Based on asymmetric features of cryo-EM 
structures and a sequential hand-over-hand model of substrate translocation, 
recent publications have proposed that the AAA+ unfoldases ClpA and ClpX rotate 
with respect to their partner peptidase ClpP to allow function. Here, we test 
this model by covalently crosslinking ClpA to ClpP to prevent rotation. We find 
that crosslinked ClpAP complexes unfold, translocate, and degrade protein 
substrates in vitro, albeit modestly slower than uncrosslinked enzyme controls. 
Rotation of ClpA with respect to ClpP is therefore not required for ClpAP 
protease activity, although some flexibility in how the AAA+ ring docks with 
ClpP may be necessary for optimal function.

In bacteria, AAA+ proteases such as Lon and ClpXP degrade substrates with 
exquisite specificity. These machines capture the energy of ATP hydrolysis to 
power unfolding and degradation of target substrates. Here, we show that a 
mutation in the ATP binding site of ClpX shifts protease specificity to promote 
degradation of normally Lon-restricted substrates. However, this ClpX mutant is 
worse at degrading ClpXP targets, suggesting an optimal balance in substrate 
preference for a given protease that is easy to alter. In vitro, wild-type ClpXP 
also degrades Lon-restricted substrates more readily when ATP levels are 
reduced, similar to the shifted specificity of mutant ClpXP, which has altered 
ATP hydrolysis kinetics. Based on these results, we suggest that the rates of 
ATP hydrolysis not only power substrate unfolding and degradation, but also tune 
protease specificity. We consider various models for this effect based on 
emerging structures of AAA+ machines showing conformationally distinct states.

Protein quality control pathways require AAA+ proteases, such as Clp and Lon. 
Lon protease maintains UmuD, an important component of the error-prone DNA 
repair polymerase (Pol V), at very low levels in E. coli. Most members of the 
phylum Cyanobacteria lack Lon (including the model cyanobacterium, Synechocystis 
sp. PCC6803), so maintenance of UmuD at low levels must employ different 
proteases. We demonstrate that the first 19 residues from the N-terminus of UmuD 
(Sug1-19 ) fused to a reporter protein are adequate to trigger complete 
proteolysis and that mutation of a single leucine residue (L6) to aspartic acid 
inhibits proteolysis. This process appears to follow the N-end rule and is 
mediated by ClpA/P protease and the ClpS adaptor. Additionally, mutations of 
arginine residues in the Sug1-19 tag suggest that the ClpX/P pathway also plays 
a role in proteolysis. We propose that there is a dual degron at the N-terminus 
of the UmuD protein in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, which is distinct from the 
degron required for degradation of UmuD in E. coli. The use of two proteolysis 
pathways to tune levels of UmuD might reflect how a photosynthetic organism 
responds to multiple environmental stressors.

Roles of the N domain of the AAA+ Lon protease in substrate recognition, 
allosteric regulation and chaperone activity.

Degron binding regulates the activities of the AAA+ Lon protease in addition to 
targeting proteins for degradation. The sul20 degron from the cell-division 
inhibitor SulA is shown here to bind to the N domain of Escherichia coli Lon, 
and the recognition site is identified by cross-linking and scanning for 
mutations that prevent sul20-peptide binding. These N-domain mutations limit the 
rates of proteolysis of model sul20-tagged substrates and ATP hydrolysis by an 
allosteric mechanism. Lon inactivation of SulA in vivo requires binding to the N 
domain and robust ATP hydrolysis but does not require degradation or 
translocation into the proteolytic chamber. Lon-mediated relief of proteotoxic 
stress and protein aggregation in vivo can also occur without degradation but is 
not dependent on robust ATP hydrolysis. In combination, these results 
demonstrate that Lon can function as a protease or a chaperone and reveal that 
some of its ATP-dependent biological activities do not require translocation.

DNA replication initiation proteins (Reps) are subjected to degradation by 
cellular proteases. We investigated how the formation of nucleoprotein complex, 
involving Rep and a protease, affects Rep degradation. All known Escherichia 
coli AAA+ cytosolic proteases and the replication initiation protein TrfA of the 
broad-host-range plasmid RK2 were used. Our results revealed that DNA influences 
the degradation process and that the observed effects are opposite and protease 
specific. In the case of ClpXP and ClpYQ proteases, DNA abolishes proteolysis, 
while in the case of ClpAP and Lon proteases it stimulates the process. ClpX and 
ClpY cannot interact with DNA-bound TrfA, while the ClpAP and Lon activities are 
enhanced by the formation of nucleoprotein complexes involving both the protease 
and TrfA. Lon has to interact with TrfA before contacting DNA, or this 
interaction can occur with TrfA already bound to DNA. The TrfA degradation by 
Lon can be carried out only on DNA. The absence of Lon results with higher 
stability of TrfA in the cell.

The SOS response is governed by the transcriptional regulator LexA and is 
elicited in many bacterial species in response to DNA damaging conditions. 
Induction of the SOS response is mediated by autocleavage of the LexA repressor 
resulting in a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) and an N-terminal 
DNA-binding domain (NTD) known to retain some DNA-binding activity. The 
proteases responsible for degrading the LexA domains have been identified in 
Escherichia coli as ClpXP and Lon. Here, we show that in the human and animal 
pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, the ClpXP and ClpCP proteases contribute to 
degradation of the NTD and to a lesser degree the CTD. In the absence of the 
proteolytic subunit, ClpP, or one or both of the Clp ATPases, ClpX and ClpC, the 
LexA domains were stabilized after autocleavage. Production of a stabilized 
variant of the NTD interfered with mitomycin-mediated induction of sosA 
expression while leaving lexA unaffected, and also significantly reduced 
SOS-induced mutagenesis. Our results show that sequential proteolysis of LexA is 
conserved in S. aureus and that the NTD may differentially regulate a subset of 
genes in the SOS regulon.

Escherichia coli toxin/antitoxin pair MqsR/MqsA regulate toxin CspD.

Previously we identified that the Escherichia coli protein MqsR (YgiU) functions 
as a toxin and that it is involved in the regulation of motility by quorum 
sensing signal autoinducer-2 (AI-2). Furthermore, MqsR is directly associated 
with biofilm development and is linked to the development of persister cells. 
Here we show that MqsR and MqsA (YgiT) are a toxin/antitoxin (TA) pair, which, 
in significant difference to other TA pairs, regulates additional loci besides 
its own. We have recently identified that MqsR functions as an RNase. However, 
using three sets of whole-transcriptome studies and two nickel-enrichment DNA 
binding microarrays coupled with cell survival studies in which MqsR was 
overproduced in isogenic mutants, we identified eight genes (cspD, clpX, clpP, 
lon, yfjZ, relB, relE and hokA) that are involved in a mode of MqsR toxicity in 
addition to its RNase activity. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that (i) the MqsR/MqsA complex (and 
MqsA alone) represses the toxin gene cspD, (ii) MqsR overproduction induces 
cspD, (iii) stress induces cspD, and (iv) stress fails to induce cspD when 
MqsR/MqsA are overproduced or when mqsRA is deleted. Electrophoretic mobility 
shift assays show that the MqsA/MqsR complex binds the promoter of cspD. In 
addition, proteases Lon and ClpXP are necessary for MqsR toxicity. Together, 
these results indicate the MqsR/MqsA complex represses cspD which may be 
derepressed by titrating MqsA with MqsR or by degrading MqsA via stress 
conditions through proteases Lon and ClpXP. Hence, we demonstrate that the 
MqsR/MqsA TA system controls cell physiology via its own toxicity as well as 
through its regulation of another toxin, CspD.

Evidence that two ATP-dependent (Lon) proteases in Borrelia burgdorferi serve 
different functions.

The canonical ATP-dependent protease Lon participates in an assortment of 
biological processes in bacteria, including the catalysis of damaged or 
senescent proteins and short-lived regulatory proteins. Borrelia spirochetes are 
unusual in that they code for two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, Lon-1 and 
Lon-2. Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted 
through the blood feeding of Ixodes ticks. Previous work in our laboratory 
reported that B. burgdorferi lon-1 is upregulated transcriptionally by exposure 
to blood in vitro, while lon-2 is not. Because blood induction of Lon-1 may be 
of importance in the regulation of virulence factors critical for spirochete 
transmission, the clarification of functional roles for these two proteases in 
B. burgdorferi was the object of this study. On the chromosome, lon-2 is 
immediately downstream of ATP-dependent proteases clpP and clpX, an arrangement 
identical to that of lon of Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in the NH(2)-terminal 
substrate binding domains that may reflect differences in substrate specificity. 
Recombinant Lon-1 manifested properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease 
in vitro but did not complement an E. coli Lon mutant, while Lon-2 corrected two 
characteristic Lon-mutant phenotypes. We conclude that B. burgdorferi Lons -1 
and -2 have distinct functional roles. Lon-2 functions in a manner consistent 
with canonical Lon, engaged in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, by virtue of its 
blood induction, and as a unique feature of the Borreliae, may be important in 
host adaptation from the arthropod to a warm-blooded host.

Toxins Hha and CspD and small RNA regulator Hfq are involved in persister cell 
formation through MqsR in Escherichia coli.

Persisters are cells which evade stresses like antibiotics and which are 
characterized by reduced metabolism and a lack of genetic alterations required 
to achieve this state. We showed previously that MqsR and MqsA of Escherichia 
coli are a toxin-antitoxin pair that influence cell physiology (e.g., biofilm 
formation and motility) via RNase activity as well as through regulation of 
toxin CspD. Here, we show that deletion of the mqsRA locus decreases persister 
cell formation and, consistent with this result, over production of MqsR 
increases persister cell formation. Furthermore, toxins Hha, CspD, and HokA 
increase persister cell formation. In addition, by overproducing MqsR in a 
series of isogenic mutants, we show that Hha and CspD are necessary for 
persister cell formation via MqsR overexpression. Surprisingly, Hfq, a small RNA 
chaperone, decreases persistence. A whole-transcriptome study shows that Hfq 
induces transport-related genes (opp genes and dppA), outer membrane 
protein-related genes (ybfM and ybfN), toxins (hha), and proteases (clpX, clpP, 
and lon). Taken together, these results indicate that toxins CspD, Hha, and HokA 
influence persister cell formation via MqsR and that Hfq plays an important role 
in the regulation of persister cell formation via regulation of transport or 
outer membrane proteins OppA and YbfM.

Turnover of endogenous SsrA-tagged proteins mediated by ATP-dependent proteases 
in Escherichia coli.

Maryland 20892, USA.

Formation and degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins enable ribosome recycling and 
elimination of defective products of incomplete translation. We produced an 
antibody against the SsrA peptide and used it to measure the amounts of 
SsrA-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli cells without interfering with tagging 
or altering the context of the tag added at the ends of nascent polypeptides. 
SsrA-tagged proteins were present in very small amounts unless a component of 
the ClpXP protease was missing. From the levels of tagged proteins in cells in 
which degradation is essentially blocked, we calculate that > or =1 in 200 
translation products receives an SsrA tag. ClpXP is responsible for > or =90% of 
the degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins. The degradation rate in wild type cells 
is > or =1.4 min(-1) and decreases to approximately 0.10 min(-1) in a clpX 
mutant. The rate of degradation by ClpXP is decreased approximately 3-fold in 
mutants lacking the adaptor SspB, whereas degradation by ClpAP is increased 
3-5-fold. However, ClpAP degrades SsrA-tagged proteins slowly even in the 
absence of SspB, possibly because of interference from ClpA-specific substrates. 
Lon protease degrades SsrA-tagged proteins at a rate of approximately 0.05 
min(-1) in the presence or absence of SspB. We conclude that ClpXP, together 
with SspB, is uniquely adapted for degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins and is 
responsible for the major part of their degradation in vivo.

Modulating substrate choice: the SspB adaptor delivers a regulator of the 
extracytoplasmic-stress response to the AAA+ protease ClpXP for degradation.

Adaptor proteins help proteases modulate substrate choice, ensuring that 
appropriate proteins are degraded at the proper time and place. SspB is an 
adaptor that delivers ssrA-tagged proteins to the AAA+ protease ClpXP for 
degradation. To identify new SspB-regulated substrates, we examined proteins 
captured by ClpXP(trap) in sspB(+) but not sspB(-) strains. RseA(1-108), a 
fragment of a transmembrane protein that regulates the extracytoplasmic-stress 
response, fits this criterion. In response to stress, RseA is cleaved on each 
side of the membrane and is released as a cytoplasmic fragment that remains 
bound in an inhibitory complex with the sigma(E) transcription factor. Trapping 
experiments together with biochemical studies show that ClpXP functions in 
concert with SspB to efficiently recognize and degrade RseA(1-108), and thereby 
releases sigma(E). Genetic studies confirm that ClpX and SspB participate in 
induction of the sigma(E) regulon in vivo, acting at the final step of an 
activating proteolytic cascade. Surprisingly, the SspB-recognition sequence in 
RseA(1-108) is unrelated to its binding sequence in the ssrA tag. Thus, these 
experiments elucidate the final steps in induction of the extracytoplasmic 
stress response and reveal that SspB delivers a broader spectrum of substrates 
to ClpXP than has been recognized.

Accumulation of sigmaS due to enhanced synthesis and decreased degradation in 
acidic phospholipid-deficient Escherichia coli cells.

The Escherichia coli pgsA3 mutation, which causes deficiency in acidic 
phospholipids, leads to a significant accumulation of sigma(S). This 
accumulation is partly accounted for by the higher transcription level of rpoS; 
however, it has also been suggested that the cells accumulate sigma(S) 
post-transcriptionally. We found that the level of the small regulatory RNA 
RprA, which is involved in the promotion of rpoS translation, is higher in pgsA3 
cells than in pgsA(+) cells. Induction of altered rpoS mRNA that does not depend 
on RprA in pgsA(+) cells did not increase the level of sigma(S) to the high 
level observed in pgsA3 cells, suggesting post-translational sigma(S) 
accumulation in the latter. The mRNA levels of clpX and clpP, whose products 
form a ClpXP protease that degrades sigma(S), were much reduced in pgsA3 cells. 
Consistent with the reduced mRNA levels, the half-life of sigma(S) in pgsA3 
cells was much longer than in pgsA(+) cells, indicating that downregulation of 
the degradation is a major cause for the high sigma(S) content. We show that the 
downregulation can be partially attributed to activated CpxAR in the mutant 
cells, which causes repression of rpoE on whose gene product the expression of 
clpPX depends.

The cellular response of Escherichia coli to overproduction of the insoluble 
heterologous protein alpha-glucosidase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae during a 
glucose-limited fed-batch fermentation was analyzed on the transcriptional and 
the translational levels. After the induction of the tac-regulated 
overexpression of the recombinant model protein, a significant but transient 
increase of the mRNA levels of the heat shock genes lon and dnaK could be 
observed. The mRNA level of the gene coding for the inclusion body-associated 
protein IbpB showed the strongest increase and remained at a clearly higher 
level until the end of the fermentation. By contrast, the mRNA levels of htrA 
and ppiB were decreased after induction of the alpha-glucosidase overexpression. 
Analysis of the soluble cytoplasmic protein fraction 3 h after induction 
revealed increased levels of the chaperones GroEL, DnaK, and Tig and a decrease 
in the protein levels of the two ribosomal proteins S6 and L9, the 
peptidylprolyl-cis-trans-isomerase PpiB, and the sigma(38)-dependent protein 
Dps. Analysis of the aggregated protein fraction revealed a remarkably 
inhomogeneous composition of the alpha-glucosidase inclusion bodies. N-terminal 
sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identification showed that most of 
these spots are fragments of the heterologous alpha-glucosidase. Host stress 
proteins, like DnaK, GroEL, IbpA, IbpB, and OmpT, have been found to be 
associated with the alpha-glucosidase protein aggregates.

The nucleotide sequence of clpX, which is localized between the tig (trigger 
factor) and the lon (ATP-dependent protease) genes at 245 degrees on the 
standard Bacillus subtilis (Bs) genetic map, was determined. The putative clpX 
gene codes for a 46-kDa protein of 421 amino acid (aa) residues. A comparison of 
the deduced aa sequence with those of the recently described bacterial clpX gene 
products from Synechocystis sp., Escherichia coli (Ec), Haemophilus influenzae 
and Azotobacter vinelandii revealed strong similarities. However, in contrast to 
Ec, clpX and clpP of Bs are located at different loci on the chromosome and are 
transcribed as monocistronic genes. A heat-inducible sigma A-like promoter was 
mapped upstream of the clpX structural gene, but no CIRCE element, 
characteristic of class-I heat-shock genes (e.g., groESL and dnaK), was found 
between the transcriptional and translational start sites. Although the majority 
of the heat-inducible general stress genes in Bs are under the control of the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma B, the heat induction of clpX appears to be 
sigma B-independent. The latter indicates that clpX belongs to class-III 
heat-inducible genes.

Hsp100 chaperones, also known as Clp proteins, constitute a family of 
ring-forming ATPases that differ in 3D structure and cellular function from 
other stress-inducible molecular chaperones. While the vast majority of 
ATP-dependent molecular chaperones promote the folding of either the nascent 
chain or a newly imported polypeptide to reach its native conformation, Hsp100 
chaperones harness metabolic energy to perform the reverse and facilitate the 
unfolding of a misfolded polypeptide or protein aggregate. It is now known that 
inside cells and organelles, different Hsp100 members are involved in rescuing 
stress-damaged proteins from a previously aggregated state or in recycling 
polypeptides marked for degradation. Protein degradation is mediated by a 
barrel-shaped peptidase that physically associates with the Hsp100 hexamer to 
form a two-component system. Notable examples include the ClpA:ClpP (ClpAP) and 
ClpX:ClpP (ClpXP) proteases that resemble the ring-forming FtsH and Lon 
proteases, which unlike ClpAP and ClpXP, feature the ATP-binding and proteolytic 
domains in a single polypeptide chain. Recent advances in electron 
cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) together with single-molecule biophysical studies have 
now provided new mechanistic insight into the structure and function of this 
remarkable group of macromolecular machines.

Members of the genus Shigella carry a large plasmid, pINV, which is essential 
for virulence. In Shigella flexneri, pINV harbours three toxin-antitoxin (TA) 
systems, CcdAB, GmvAT and VapBC that promote vertical transmission of the 
plasmid. Type II TA systems, such as those on pINV, consist of a toxic protein 
and protein antitoxin. Selective degradation of the antitoxin by proteases leads 
to the unopposed action of the toxin once genes encoding a TA system have been 
lost, such as following failure to inherit a plasmid harbouring a TA system. 
Here, we investigate the role of proteases in the function of the pINV TA 
systems and demonstrate that Lon, but not ClpP, is required for their activity 
during plasmid stability. This provides the first evidence that 
acetyltransferase family TA systems, such as GmvAT, can be regulated by Lon. 
Interestingly, S. flexneri pINV also harbours two putative partitioning systems, 
ParAB and StbAB. We show that both systems are functional for plasmid 
maintenance although their activity is masked by other systems on pINV. Using a 
model vector based on the pINV replicon, we observe temperature-dependent 
differences between the two partitioning systems that contribute to our 
understanding of the maintenance of virulence in Shigella species.

The activity of type II toxin-antitoxin systems (TA), which are responsible for 
many important features of bacterial cells, is based on the differences between 
toxin and antitoxin stabilities. The antitoxin lability results from bacterial 
protease activity. Here, we investigated how particular Escherichia coli 
cytosolic proteases, namely, Lon, ClpAP, ClpXP, and ClpYQ, affect the stability 
of both the toxin and antitoxin components of the parDE system from the broad 
host range plasmid RK2. The results of our in vivo and in vitro experiments show 
that the ParD antitoxin is degraded by the ClpAP protease, and dsDNA stimulates 
this process. The ParE toxin is not degraded by any of these proteases and can 
therefore cause growth inhibition of plasmid-free cells after an unequal plasmid 
distribution during cell division. We also demonstrate that the ParE toxin 
interaction with ParD prevents antitoxin proteolysis by ClpAP; however, this 
interaction does not prevent the ClpAP interaction with ParD. We show that ClpAP 
protease homologs affect plasmid stability in other bacterial species, 
indicating that ClpAP is a universal activator of the parDE system and that ParD 
is a universal substrate for ClpAP.

Analyses of mutations in rpoB subunit of Escherichia coli that lead to 
resistance to rifampicin have been invaluable in providing insight into events 
during transcription continue to be discovered. Earlier we reported that rpoB12 
suppresses over-expression of cps genes in Δlon mutant of E. coli, by 
interfering with the transcription of rcsA. Here we report Microarray based 
Transcriptome profile of Δlon and Δlon rpoB12 strains. The data analyses clearly 
reveal that rpoB12 mutation results in the differential expression of ∼450 
genes. The transcription profiles of some of the genes namely, rcsA, gadE, csgD, 
bolA, ypdI, dnaJ, clpP, csrA and hdeA are significantly altered, particularly 
the genes implicated in virulence. Some of the phenotypic traits namely, biofilm 
formation, motility, curli synthesis and ability to withstand acidic stress in a 
lon+rpoB12 strain were assessed. The results clearly indicate that rpoB12 
up-regulates biofilm formation and curli synthesis while it makes the cells 
sensitive for growth in acidic medium and inhibits motility almost completely. 
Furthermore, rpoB12 modulates the expression profile of a significant number of 
genes involved in stress responses, genes encoding small RNAs. Thus, this study 
reveals the versatile role of the rpoB12 mutation, especially its impact on the 
regulation of genes related to virulence and highlights its medical importance.

Cells possess protein quality control mechanisms to maintain proper cellular 
homeostasis. In eukaryotes, the roles of the ubiquitination and 
proteasome-mediated degradation of cellular proteins is well established. Recent 
studies have elucidated protein tagging mechanisms in prokaryotes, involving 
transfer messenger RNA (tmRNA) and pupylation. In this review, newer insights 
and bioinformatics analysis of two distinct bacterial protein tagging 
machineries are discussed. The machinery for tmRNAmediated tagging is present in 
several eubacterial representatives, e.g. Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis, Bacillus subtilis etc., but not in two archaeal representatives, 
such as Thermoplasma acidophilum and Sulfolobus solfataricus. On the other hand, 
the machinery involving tagging with the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein 
(Pup) is absent in most bacteria but is encoded in some eubacterial 
representatives, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. 
Furthermore, molecular details on the relationship between protein tagging and 
enzymes involved in protein degradation in bacteria during infection are 
emerging. Several pathogenic bacteria that do not express the major 
ATP-dependent proteases, Lon and Caseinolytic protease (ClpP), are avirulent. 
Also, some ATP-independent peptidases, such as PepA and PepN, modulate the 
infection process. The roles of bacterial proteins involved in tagging and 
degradation during infection are discussed. These aspects add a new dimension to 
better understanding of the peculiarities of host-pathogen interactions.

Specific nucleoprotein complexes are formed strictly to prevent over-initiation 
of DNA replication. An example of those is the so-called handcuff complex, in 
which two plasmid molecules are coupled together with plasmid-encoded 
replication initiation protein (Rep). In this work, we elucidate the mechanism 
of the handcuff complex disruption. In vitro tests, including dissociation 
progress analysis, demonstrate that the dimeric variants of plasmid RK2 
replication initiation protein TrfA are involved in assembling the plasmid 
handcuff complex which, as we found, reveals high stability. Particular 
proteases, namely Lon and ClpAP, disrupt the handcuff by degrading TrfA, thus 
affecting plasmid stability. Moreover, our data demonstrate that TrfA monomers 
are able to dissociate handcuffed plasmid molecules. Those monomers displace 
TrfA molecules, which are involved in handcuff formation, and through 
interaction with the uncoupled plasmid replication origins they re-initiate DNA 
synthesis. We discuss the relevance of both Rep monomers and host proteases for 
plasmid maintenance under vegetative and stress conditions.

Toxin-antitoxin systems are ubiquitous in nature and present on the chromosomes 
of both bacteria and archaea. MazEF is a type II toxin-antitoxin system present 
on the chromosome of Escherichia coli and other bacteria. Whether MazEF is 
involved in programmed cell death or reversible growth inhibition and bacterial 
persistence is a matter of debate. In the present work the role of MazF in 
bacterial physiology was studied by using an inactive, active-site mutant of 
MazF, E24A, to activate WT MazF expression from its own promoter. The ectopic 
expression of E24A MazF in a strain containing WT mazEF resulted in reversible 
growth arrest. Normal growth resumed on inhibiting the expression of E24A MazF. 
MazF-mediated growth arrest resulted in an increase in survival of bacterial 
cells during antibiotic stress. This was studied by activation of mazEF either 
by overexpression of an inactive, active-site mutant or pre-exposure to a 
sublethal dose of antibiotic. The MazF-mediated persistence phenotype was found 
to be independent of RecA and dependent on the presence of the ClpP and Lon 
proteases. This study confirms the role of MazEF in reversible growth inhibition 
and persistence.

E. coli ClpA catalyzed polypeptide translocation is allosterically controlled by 
the protease ClpP.

Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35294-1240, USA.

There are five known ATP-dependent proteases in Escherichia coli (Lon, ClpAP, 
ClpXP, HslUV, and the membrane-associated FtsH) that catalyze the removal of 
both misfolded and properly folded proteins in cellular protein quality control 
pathways. Hexameric ClpA rings associate with one or both faces of the 
cylindrically shaped tetradecameric ClpP protease. ClpA catalyzes unfolding and 
translocation of polypeptide substrates into the proteolytic core of ClpP for 
degradation through repeated cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis at two 
nucleotide binding domains on each ClpA monomer. We previously reported a 
molecular mechanism for ClpA catalyzed polypeptide translocation in the absence 
of ClpP, including elementary rate constants, overall rate, and the kinetic step 
size. However, the potential allosteric effect of ClpP on the mechanism of ClpA 
catalyzed translocation remains unclear. Using single-turnover fluorescence 
stopped-flow methods, here we report that ClpA, when associated with ClpP, 
translocates polypeptide with an overall rate of ~35 aa s(-1) and, on average, 
traverses ~5 aa between two rate-limiting steps with reduced cooperativity 
between ATP binding sites in the hexameric ring. This is in direct contrast to 
our previously reported observation that, in the absence of ClpP, ClpA 
translocates polypeptide substrates with a maximum translocation rate of ~20 aa 
s(-1) with cooperativity between ATPase sites. Our results demonstrate that ClpP 
allosterically impacts the polypeptide translocation activity of ClpA by 
reducing the cooperativity between ATP binding sites.

Transcriptional cross-activation between toxin-antitoxin systems of Escherichia 
coli.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are formed by potent 
regulatory or suicide factors (toxins) and their short-lived inhibitors 
(antitoxins). Antitoxins are DNA-binding proteins and auto-repress transcription 
of TA operons. Transcription of multiple TA operons is activated in temporarily 
non-growing persister cells that can resist killing by antibiotics. 
Consequently, the antitoxin levels of persisters must have been dropped and 
toxins are released of inhibition.
RESULTS: Here, we describe transcriptional cross-activation between different TA 
systems of Escherichia coli. We find that the chromosomal relBEF operon is 
activated in response to production of the toxins MazF, MqsR, HicA, and HipA. 
Expression of the RelE toxin in turn induces transcription of several TA 
operons. We show that induction of mazEF during amino acid starvation depends on 
relBE and does not occur in a relBEF deletion mutant. Induction of TA operons 
has been previously shown to depend on Lon protease which is activated by 
polyphospate accumulation. We show that transcriptional cross-activation occurs 
also in strains deficient for Lon, ClpP, and HslV proteases and polyphosphate 
kinase. Furthermore, we find that toxins cleave the TA mRNA in vivo, which is 
followed by degradation of the antitoxin-encoding fragments and selective 
accumulation of the toxin-encoding regions. We show that these accumulating 
fragments can be translated to produce more toxin.
CONCLUSION: Transcriptional activation followed by cleavage of the mRNA and 
disproportionate production of the toxin constitutes a possible positive 
feedback loop, which can fire other TA systems and cause bistable growth 
heterogeneity. Cross-interacting TA systems have a potential to form a complex 
network of mutually activating regulators in bacteria.

Differential stability of toxins and antitoxins is the key for the conditional 
activation and function of Toxin-Antitoxin systems. Here we report the 
evaluation of the action of cell proteases Lon, ClpAP, ClpXP and ClpYQ on the 
Kis antitoxin and the Kid toxin of the parD TA system of plasmid R1. In vitro 
analysis shows that Kis antitoxin, but not the Kid toxin, is cleaved 
specifically by the ClpAP protease. The Kid toxin is not cleaved either by this 
protease or by any of the others cell proteases tested but in complex with the 
Kis antitoxin protects the cleavage of this protein in a way that is dependent 
on the toxin-antitoxin ratio. We further show that this protection is correlated 
with the inability of the ClpA chaperone to access the Kis antitoxin when in 
complex with Kid toxin. The stability of the antitoxin greatly increases in vivo 
in a clpP- background and plasmid maintenance mediated by the parD system, which 
is dependent on the differential decay of the antitoxin, is reduced to the 
levels observed in the absence of a functional toxin. The functional 
implications of these data are further discussed within the frame of the 
regulation of the parD system and of the available information on the nature of 
the toxin-antitoxin complexes formed at different toxin-antitoxin ratios.

Hsp100 chaperones, also known as Clp proteins, constitute a family of 
ring-forming ATPases that differ in 3D structure and cellular function from 
other stress-inducible molecular chaperones. While the vast majority of 
ATP-dependent molecular chaperones promote the folding of either the nascent 
chain or a newly imported polypeptide to reach its native conformation, Hsp100 
chaperones harness metabolic energy to perform the reverse and facilitate the 
unfolding of a misfolded polypeptide or protein aggregate. It is now known that 
inside cells and organelles, different Hsp100 members are involved in rescuing 
stress-damaged proteins from a previously aggregated state or in recycling 
polypeptides marked for degradation. Protein degradation is mediated by a 
barrel-shaped peptidase that physically associates with the Hsp100 hexamer to 
form a two-component system. Notable examples include the ClpA:ClpP (ClpAP) and 
ClpX:ClpP (ClpXP) proteases that resemble the ring-forming FtsH and Lon 
proteases, which unlike ClpAP and ClpXP, feature the ATP-binding and proteolytic 
domains in a single polypeptide chain. Recent advances in electron 
cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) together with single-molecule biophysical studies have 
now provided new mechanistic insight into the structure and function of this 
remarkable group of macromolecular machines.

In bacteria, AAA+ proteases such as Lon and ClpXP degrade substrates with 
exquisite specificity. These machines capture the energy of ATP hydrolysis to 
power unfolding and degradation of target substrates. Here, we show that a 
mutation in the ATP binding site of ClpX shifts protease specificity to promote 
degradation of normally Lon-restricted substrates. However, this ClpX mutant is 
worse at degrading ClpXP targets, suggesting an optimal balance in substrate 
preference for a given protease that is easy to alter. In vitro, wild-type ClpXP 
also degrades Lon-restricted substrates more readily when ATP levels are 
reduced, similar to the shifted specificity of mutant ClpXP, which has altered 
ATP hydrolysis kinetics. Based on these results, we suggest that the rates of 
ATP hydrolysis not only power substrate unfolding and degradation, but also tune 
protease specificity. We consider various models for this effect based on 
emerging structures of AAA+ machines showing conformationally distinct states.

Protein quality control pathways require AAA+ proteases, such as Clp and Lon. 
Lon protease maintains UmuD, an important component of the error-prone DNA 
repair polymerase (Pol V), at very low levels in E. coli. Most members of the 
phylum Cyanobacteria lack Lon (including the model cyanobacterium, Synechocystis 
sp. PCC6803), so maintenance of UmuD at low levels must employ different 
proteases. We demonstrate that the first 19 residues from the N-terminus of UmuD 
(Sug1-19 ) fused to a reporter protein are adequate to trigger complete 
proteolysis and that mutation of a single leucine residue (L6) to aspartic acid 
inhibits proteolysis. This process appears to follow the N-end rule and is 
mediated by ClpA/P protease and the ClpS adaptor. Additionally, mutations of 
arginine residues in the Sug1-19 tag suggest that the ClpX/P pathway also plays 
a role in proteolysis. We propose that there is a dual degron at the N-terminus 
of the UmuD protein in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, which is distinct from the 
degron required for degradation of UmuD in E. coli. The use of two proteolysis 
pathways to tune levels of UmuD might reflect how a photosynthetic organism 
responds to multiple environmental stressors.

Roles of the N domain of the AAA+ Lon protease in substrate recognition, 
allosteric regulation and chaperone activity.

Degron binding regulates the activities of the AAA+ Lon protease in addition to 
targeting proteins for degradation. The sul20 degron from the cell-division 
inhibitor SulA is shown here to bind to the N domain of Escherichia coli Lon, 
and the recognition site is identified by cross-linking and scanning for 
mutations that prevent sul20-peptide binding. These N-domain mutations limit the 
rates of proteolysis of model sul20-tagged substrates and ATP hydrolysis by an 
allosteric mechanism. Lon inactivation of SulA in vivo requires binding to the N 
domain and robust ATP hydrolysis but does not require degradation or 
translocation into the proteolytic chamber. Lon-mediated relief of proteotoxic 
stress and protein aggregation in vivo can also occur without degradation but is 
not dependent on robust ATP hydrolysis. In combination, these results 
demonstrate that Lon can function as a protease or a chaperone and reveal that 
some of its ATP-dependent biological activities do not require translocation.

Biotechnology, University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.

DNA replication initiation proteins (Reps) are subjected to degradation by 
cellular proteases. We investigated how the formation of nucleoprotein complex, 
involving Rep and a protease, affects Rep degradation. All known Escherichia 
coli AAA+ cytosolic proteases and the replication initiation protein TrfA of the 
broad-host-range plasmid RK2 were used. Our results revealed that DNA influences 
the degradation process and that the observed effects are opposite and protease 
specific. In the case of ClpXP and ClpYQ proteases, DNA abolishes proteolysis, 
while in the case of ClpAP and Lon proteases it stimulates the process. ClpX and 
ClpY cannot interact with DNA-bound TrfA, while the ClpAP and Lon activities are 
enhanced by the formation of nucleoprotein complexes involving both the protease 
and TrfA. Lon has to interact with TrfA before contacting DNA, or this 
interaction can occur with TrfA already bound to DNA. The TrfA degradation by 
Lon can be carried out only on DNA. The absence of Lon results with higher 
stability of TrfA in the cell.

The SOS response is governed by the transcriptional regulator LexA and is 
elicited in many bacterial species in response to DNA damaging conditions. 
Induction of the SOS response is mediated by autocleavage of the LexA repressor 
resulting in a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) and an N-terminal 
DNA-binding domain (NTD) known to retain some DNA-binding activity. The 
proteases responsible for degrading the LexA domains have been identified in 
Escherichia coli as ClpXP and Lon. Here, we show that in the human and animal 
pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, the ClpXP and ClpCP proteases contribute to 
degradation of the NTD and to a lesser degree the CTD. In the absence of the 
proteolytic subunit, ClpP, or one or both of the Clp ATPases, ClpX and ClpC, the 
LexA domains were stabilized after autocleavage. Production of a stabilized 
variant of the NTD interfered with mitomycin-mediated induction of sosA 
expression while leaving lexA unaffected, and also significantly reduced 
SOS-induced mutagenesis. Our results show that sequential proteolysis of LexA is 
conserved in S. aureus and that the NTD may differentially regulate a subset of 
genes in the SOS regulon.

Escherichia coli toxin/antitoxin pair MqsR/MqsA regulate toxin CspD.

Previously we identified that the Escherichia coli protein MqsR (YgiU) functions 
as a toxin and that it is involved in the regulation of motility by quorum 
sensing signal autoinducer-2 (AI-2). Furthermore, MqsR is directly associated 
with biofilm development and is linked to the development of persister cells. 
Here we show that MqsR and MqsA (YgiT) are a toxin/antitoxin (TA) pair, which, 
in significant difference to other TA pairs, regulates additional loci besides 
its own. We have recently identified that MqsR functions as an RNase. However, 
using three sets of whole-transcriptome studies and two nickel-enrichment DNA 
binding microarrays coupled with cell survival studies in which MqsR was 
overproduced in isogenic mutants, we identified eight genes (cspD, clpX, clpP, 
lon, yfjZ, relB, relE and hokA) that are involved in a mode of MqsR toxicity in 
addition to its RNase activity. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that (i) the MqsR/MqsA complex (and 
MqsA alone) represses the toxin gene cspD, (ii) MqsR overproduction induces 
cspD, (iii) stress induces cspD, and (iv) stress fails to induce cspD when 
MqsR/MqsA are overproduced or when mqsRA is deleted. Electrophoretic mobility 
shift assays show that the MqsA/MqsR complex binds the promoter of cspD. In 
addition, proteases Lon and ClpXP are necessary for MqsR toxicity. Together, 
these results indicate the MqsR/MqsA complex represses cspD which may be 
derepressed by titrating MqsA with MqsR or by degrading MqsA via stress 
conditions through proteases Lon and ClpXP. Hence, we demonstrate that the 
MqsR/MqsA TA system controls cell physiology via its own toxicity as well as 
through its regulation of another toxin, CspD.

Evidence that two ATP-dependent (Lon) proteases in Borrelia burgdorferi serve 
different functions.

The canonical ATP-dependent protease Lon participates in an assortment of 
biological processes in bacteria, including the catalysis of damaged or 
senescent proteins and short-lived regulatory proteins. Borrelia spirochetes are 
unusual in that they code for two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, Lon-1 and 
Lon-2. Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted 
through the blood feeding of Ixodes ticks. Previous work in our laboratory 
reported that B. burgdorferi lon-1 is upregulated transcriptionally by exposure 
to blood in vitro, while lon-2 is not. Because blood induction of Lon-1 may be 
of importance in the regulation of virulence factors critical for spirochete 
transmission, the clarification of functional roles for these two proteases in 
B. burgdorferi was the object of this study. On the chromosome, lon-2 is 
immediately downstream of ATP-dependent proteases clpP and clpX, an arrangement 
identical to that of lon of Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in the NH(2)-terminal 
substrate binding domains that may reflect differences in substrate specificity. 
Recombinant Lon-1 manifested properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease 
in vitro but did not complement an E. coli Lon mutant, while Lon-2 corrected two 
characteristic Lon-mutant phenotypes. We conclude that B. burgdorferi Lons -1 
and -2 have distinct functional roles. Lon-2 functions in a manner consistent 
with canonical Lon, engaged in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, by virtue of its 
blood induction, and as a unique feature of the Borreliae, may be important in 
host adaptation from the arthropod to a warm-blooded host.

Toxins Hha and CspD and small RNA regulator Hfq are involved in persister cell 
formation through MqsR in Escherichia coli.

Persisters are cells which evade stresses like antibiotics and which are 
characterized by reduced metabolism and a lack of genetic alterations required 
to achieve this state. We showed previously that MqsR and MqsA of Escherichia 
coli are a toxin-antitoxin pair that influence cell physiology (e.g., biofilm 
formation and motility) via RNase activity as well as through regulation of 
toxin CspD. Here, we show that deletion of the mqsRA locus decreases persister 
cell formation and, consistent with this result, over production of MqsR 
increases persister cell formation. Furthermore, toxins Hha, CspD, and HokA 
increase persister cell formation. In addition, by overproducing MqsR in a 
series of isogenic mutants, we show that Hha and CspD are necessary for 
persister cell formation via MqsR overexpression. Surprisingly, Hfq, a small RNA 
chaperone, decreases persistence. A whole-transcriptome study shows that Hfq 
induces transport-related genes (opp genes and dppA), outer membrane 
protein-related genes (ybfM and ybfN), toxins (hha), and proteases (clpX, clpP, 
and lon). Taken together, these results indicate that toxins CspD, Hha, and HokA 
influence persister cell formation via MqsR and that Hfq plays an important role 
in the regulation of persister cell formation via regulation of transport or 
outer membrane proteins OppA and YbfM.

Turnover of endogenous SsrA-tagged proteins mediated by ATP-dependent proteases 
in Escherichia coli.

Maryland 20892, USA.

Formation and degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins enable ribosome recycling and 
elimination of defective products of incomplete translation. We produced an 
antibody against the SsrA peptide and used it to measure the amounts of 
SsrA-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli cells without interfering with tagging 
or altering the context of the tag added at the ends of nascent polypeptides. 
SsrA-tagged proteins were present in very small amounts unless a component of 
the ClpXP protease was missing. From the levels of tagged proteins in cells in 
which degradation is essentially blocked, we calculate that > or =1 in 200 
translation products receives an SsrA tag. ClpXP is responsible for > or =90% of 
the degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins. The degradation rate in wild type cells 
is > or =1.4 min(-1) and decreases to approximately 0.10 min(-1) in a clpX 
mutant. The rate of degradation by ClpXP is decreased approximately 3-fold in 
mutants lacking the adaptor SspB, whereas degradation by ClpAP is increased 
3-5-fold. However, ClpAP degrades SsrA-tagged proteins slowly even in the 
absence of SspB, possibly because of interference from ClpA-specific substrates. 
Lon protease degrades SsrA-tagged proteins at a rate of approximately 0.05 
min(-1) in the presence or absence of SspB. We conclude that ClpXP, together 
with SspB, is uniquely adapted for degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins and is 
responsible for the major part of their degradation in vivo.

Copper (Cu) is a key antibacterial component of the host innate immune system 
and almost all bacterial species possess systems that defend against the toxic 
effects of excess Cu. The Cu tolerance system in Gram-negative bacteria is 
composed minimally of a Cu sensor (CueR) and a Cu export pump (CopA). The cueR 
and copA genes are encoded on the chromosome typically as a divergent but 
contiguous operon. In Escherichia coli, cueR and copA are separated by two 
additional genes, ybaS and ybaT, which confer glutamine (Gln)-dependent acid 
tolerance and contribute to the glutamate (Glu)-dependent acid resistance system 
in this organism. Here we show that Cu strongly inhibits growth of a ∆copA 
mutant strain in acidic cultures. We further demonstrate that Cu stress impairs 
the pathway for Glu biosynthesis via glutamate synthase, leading to decreased 
intracellular levels of Glu. Addition of exogenous Glu rescues the ∆copA mutant 
from Cu stress in acidic conditions. Gln is also protective but this relies on 
the activities of YbaS and YbaT. Notably, expression of both enzymes is 
up-regulated during Cu stress. These results demonstrate a link between Cu 
stress, acid stress, and Glu/Gln metabolism, establish a role for YbaS and YbaT 
in Cu tolerance, and suggest that subtle changes in core metabolic pathways may 
contribute to overcoming host-imposed copper toxicity.

Transcriptional response of Escherichia coli to external copper.

Nara 631-8505, Japan.

Transcriptional response of Escherichia coli upon exposure to external copper 
was studied using DNA microarray and in vivo and in vitro transcription assays. 
Transcription of three hitherto-identified copper-responsive genes, copA (copper 
efflux transporter), cueO (multicopper oxidase) and cusC (tripartite copper pump 
component) became maximum at 5 min after addition of copper sulphate, and 
thereafter decreased to the preshift levels within 30 min. Microarray analysis 
at 5 min after addition of copper indicated that a total of at least 29 genes 
including these three known genes were markedly and specifically affected (28 
upregulated and one downregulated). Transcription of the divergent operons, 
cusCFB and cusRS, was found to be activated by CusR, which bound to a CusR box 
between the cusC and cusR promoters. Except for this site, the CusR box was not 
identified in the entire E. coli genome. On the other hand, transcription of 
copA and cueO was found to be activated by another copper-responsive factor 
CueR, which bound to a conserved inverted repeat sequence, CueR box. A total of 
197 CueR boxes were identified on the E. coli genome, including the CueR box 
associated with the moa operon for molybdenum cofactor synthesis. At least 10 
copper-induced genes were found to be under the control of CpxAR two-component 
system, indicating that copper is one of the signals for activation of the CpxAR 
system. In addition, transcription of yedWV, a putative two-component system, 
was activated by copper in CusR-dependent manner. Taken together we conclude 
that the copper-responsive genes are organized into a hierarchy of the 
regulation network, forming at least four regulons, i.e. CueR, CusR, CpxR and 
YedW regulons. These copper-responsive regulons appear to sense and respond to 
different concentrations of external copper.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) has multiple copies of the chaperone-usher (CU) pili 
operon in five fimbria groups: CU pili, curli, type IV pili, type III secretion 
pili, and type IV secretion pili. Commensal E. coli K-12 contains 12 CU pili 
operons. Among these operons, Sfm is expressed by the sfmACDHF operon. 
Transcriptome analyses, reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR 
analyses reported that FimZ directly binds to and activates the sfmA promoter, 
transcribing sfmACDHF. In addition, FimZ regularly induces constant cell 
elongation in E. coli, which is required for F-type ATPase function. The 
bacterial two-hybrid system showed a specific interaction between FimZ and the α 
subunit of the cytoplasmic F1 domain of F-type ATPase. Studies performed using 
mutated FimZs have revealed two active forms, I and II. Active form I is 
required for constant cell elongation involving amino acid residues K106 and 
D109. Active form II additionally required D56, a putative phosphorylation site, 
to activate the sfmA promoter. The chromosomal fimZ was hardly expressed in 
parent strain but functioned in phoB and phoP double-gene knockout strains. 
These insights may help to understand bacterial invasion restricted host 
environments by the sfm γ-type pili.

Integrated regulatory responses of fimB to N-acetylneuraminic (sialic) acid and

Bacterial-host attachment by means of bacterial adhesins is a key step in host 
colonization. Phase variation (reversible on-off switching) of the type 1 
fimbrial adhesin of Escherichia coli involves a DNA inversion catalyzed by FimB 
(switching in either direction) or FimE (mainly on-to-off switching). fimB is 
separated from the divergent yjhATS operon by a large (1.4 kbp) intergenic 
region. Short ( approximately 28 bp) cis-active elements (regions 1 and 2) close 
to yjhA stimulate fimB expression and are required for sialic acid (Neu(5)Ac) 
sensitivity of its expression [El-Labany, S., Sohanpal, B. K., Lahooti, M., 
Akerman, R. & Blomfield, I. C. (2003) Mol. Microbiol. 49, 1109-1118]. Here, we 
show that whereas NanR, a sialic acid-response regulator, binds to region 1, 
NagC, a GlcNAc-6P-responsive protein, binds to region 2 instead. The NanR- and 
NagC-binding sites lie adjacent to deoxyadenosine methylase (Dam) methylation 
sites (5'-GATC) that are protected from modification, and the two regulators are 
shown to be required for methylation protection at regions 1 and 2, 
respectively. Mutations in nanR and nagC diminish fimB expression, and both fimB 
expression and FimB recombination are inhibited by GlcNAc (3- and >35-fold, 
respectively). Sialic acid catabolism generates GlcNAc-6-P, and whereas GlcNAc 
disrupts methylation protection by NagC alone, Neu(5)Ac inhibits the protection 
mediated by both NanR and NagC as expected. Type 1 fimbriae are proinflammatory, 
and host defenses enhance the release of both Neu(5)Ac and GlcNAc by a variety 
of mechanisms. Inhibition of type 1 fimbriation by these amino sugars may thus 
help balance the interaction between E. coli and its hosts.

Structural studies of membrane proteins remain a great experimental challenge. 
Functional reconstitution into artificial nanoscale bilayer disc carriers that 
mimic the native bilayer environment allows the handling of membrane proteins in 
solution. This enables the use of small-angle scattering techniques for fast and 
reliable structural analysis. The difficulty with this approach is that the 
carrier discs contribute to the measured scattering intensity in a highly 
nontrivial fashion, making subsequent data analysis challenging. Here, an 
elegant solution to circumvent the intrinsic complexity brought about by the 
presence of the carrier disc is presented. In combination with small-angle 
neutron scattering (SANS) and the D2O/H2O-based solvent contrast-variation 
method, it is demonstrated that it is possible to prepare specifically 
deuterated carriers that become invisible to neutrons in 100% D2O at the length 
scales relevant to SANS. These `stealth' carrier discs may be used as a general 
platform for low-resolution structural studies of membrane proteins using well 
established data-analysis tools originally developed for soluble proteins.

Enzymes from hyperthermophiles can be efficiently purified after expression in 
mesophilic hosts and are well-suited for crystallisation attempts. Two enzymes 
of histidine biosynthesis from Thermotoga maritima, 
N'-((5'-phosphoribosyl)-formimino)-5-aminoimidazol-4-carb oxamid ribonucleotide 
isomerase and the cyclase moiety of imidazoleglycerol phosphate synthase, were 
overexpressed in Escherichia coli, both in their native and 
seleno-methionine-labelled forms, purified by heat precipitation of host 
proteins and crystallised. 
N'-((5'-phosphoribosyl)-formimino)-5-aminoimidazol-4-carb oxamid ribonucleotide 
isomerase crystallised in four different forms, all suitable for X-ray structure 
solution, and the cyclase moiety of imidazoleglycerol phosphate synthase yielded 
one crystal form that diffracted to atomic resolution. The obtained crystals 
will enable the determination of the first three-dimensional structures of 
enzymes from the histidine biosynthetic pathway.

Evolution fine-tunes biological pathways to achieve a robust cellular 
physiology. Two and a half billion years ago, rapidly rising levels of oxygen as 
a byproduct of blooming cyanobacterial photosynthesis resulted in a redox 
upshift in microbial energetics. The appearance of higher-redox-potential 
respiratory quinone, ubiquinone (UQ), is believed to be an adaptive response to 
this environmental transition. However, the majority of bacterial species are 
still dependent on the ancient respiratory quinone, naphthoquinone (NQ). 
Gammaproteobacteria can biosynthesize both of these respiratory quinones, where 
UQ has been associated with aerobic lifestyle and NQ with anaerobic lifestyle. 
We engineered an obligate NQ-dependent γ-proteobacterium, Escherichia coli 
ΔubiC, and performed adaptive laboratory evolution to understand the selection 
against the use of NQ in an oxic environment and also the adaptation required to 
support the NQ-driven aerobic electron transport chain. A comparative 
systems-level analysis of pre- and postevolved NQ-dependent strains revealed a 
clear shift from fermentative to oxidative metabolism enabled by higher 
periplasmic superoxide defense. This metabolic shift was driven by the concerted 
activity of 3 transcriptional regulators (PdhR, RpoS, and Fur). Analysis of 
these findings using a genome-scale model suggested that resource allocation to 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) mitigation results in lower growth rates. These 
results provide a direct elucidation of a resource allocation tradeoff between 
growth rate and ROS mitigation costs associated with NQ usage under 
oxygen-replete condition.

AIMS: Carbon monoxide is a respiratory poison and gaseous signaling molecule. 
Although CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) deliver CO with temporal and spatial 
specificity in mammals, and are proven antimicrobial agents, we do not 
understand the modes of CO toxicity. Our aim was to explore the impact of CO gas 
per se, without intervention of CORMs, on bacterial physiology and gene 
expression.
RESULTS: We used tightly controlled chemostat conditions and integrated 
transcriptomic datasets with statistical modeling to reveal the global effects 
of CO. CO is known to inhibit bacterial respiration, and we found expression of 
genes encoding energy-transducing pathways to be significantly affected via the 
global regulators, Fnr, Arc, and PdhR. Aerobically, ArcA-the response 
regulator-is transiently phosphorylated and pyruvate accumulates, mimicking 
anaerobiosis. Genes implicated in iron acquisition, and the metabolism of sulfur 
amino acids and arginine, are all perturbed. The global iron-related changes, 
confirmed by modulation of activity of the transcription factor Fur, may 
underlie enhanced siderophore excretion, diminished intracellular iron pools, 
and the sensitivity of CO-challenged bacteria to metal chelators. Although CO 
gas (unlike H2S and NO) offers little protection from antibiotics, a ruthenium 
CORM is a potent adjuvant of antibiotic activity.
INNOVATION: This is the first detailed exploration of global bacterial responses 
to CO, revealing unexpected targets with implications for employing CORMs 
therapeutically.
CONCLUSION: This work reveals the complexity of bacterial responses to CO and 
provides a basis for understanding the impacts of CO from CORMs, heme oxygenase 
activity, or environmental sources. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 24, 1013-1028.

Despite our increasing topological knowledge on regulation networks in model 
bacteria, it is largely unknown which of the many co-occurring regulatory events 
actually control metabolic function and the distribution of intracellular 
fluxes. Here, we unravel condition-dependent transcriptional control of 
Escherichia coli metabolism by large-scale (13)C-flux analysis in 91 
transcriptional regulator mutants on glucose and galactose. In contrast to the 
canonical respiro-fermentative glucose metabolism, fully respiratory galactose 
metabolism depends exclusively on the phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP)-glyoxylate 
cycle. While 2/3 of the regulators directly or indirectly affected absolute flux 
rates, the partitioning between different pathways remained largely stable with 
transcriptional control focusing primarily on the acetyl-CoA branch point. Flux 
distribution control was achieved by nine transcription factors on glucose, 
including ArcA, Fur, PdhR, IHF A and IHF B, but was exclusively mediated by the 
cAMP-dependent Crp regulation of the PEP-glyoxylate cycle flux on galactose. 
Five further transcription factors affected this flux only indirectly through 
cAMP and Crp by increasing the galactose uptake rate. Thus, E. coli actively 
limits its galactose catabolism at the expense of otherwise possible faster 
growth.

Escherichia coli possesses two homologous anaerobic C4-dicarboxylate membrane 
transporters (DcuA and DcuB) distinct from the aerobic dicarboxylate transport 
system (Dct).

The nucleotide sequences of two Escherichia coli genes, dcuA and dcuB (formerly 
designated genA and genF), have been shown to encode highly homologous products, 
M(r) 45,751 and 47,935 (434 and 446 amino acid residues) with 36% sequence 
identity (63% similarity). These proteins have a high proportion (approximately 
61%) of hydrophobic residues and are probably members of a new group of integral 
inner membrane proteins. The locations of the dcu genes, one upstream of the 
aspartase gene (dcuA-aspA) and the other downstream of the anaerobic fumarase 
gene (fumB-dcuB), suggested that they may function in the anaerobic transport of 
C4-dicarboxylic acids. Growth tests and transport studies with mutants 
containing insertionally inactivated chromosomal dcuA and dcuB genes show that 
their products perform analogous and mutually complementary roles as anaerobic 
dicarboxylate carriers. The anaerobic dicarboxylate transport systems (Dcu) are 
genetically and functionally distinct from the aerobic system (Dct).

Anode-assisted fermentations offer the benefit of an anoxic fermentation routine 
that can be applied to produce end-products with an oxidation state independent 
from the substrate. The whole cell biocatalyst transfers the surplus of 
electrons to an electrode that can be used as a non-depletable electron 
acceptor. So far, anode-assisted fermentations were shown to provide high carbon 
efficiencies but low space-time yields. This study aimed at increasing 
space-time yields of an Escherichia coli-based anode-assisted fermentation of 
glucose to acetoin. The experiments build on an obligate respiratory strain, 
that was advanced using selective adaptation and targeted strain development. 
Several transfers under respiratory conditions led to point mutations in the 
pfl, aceF and rpoC gene. These mutations increased anoxic growth by three-fold. 
Furthermore, overexpression of genes encoding a synthetic electron transport 
chain to methylene blue increased the electron transfer rate by 2.45-fold. 
Overall, these measures and a medium optimization increased the space-time yield 
in an electrode-assisted fermentation by 3.6-fold.

The antibacterial activity of extracts and isolated constituents (scopoletin, 
umckalin, 5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, 6,8-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, 
(+)-catechin, gallic acid and its methyl ester) of Pelargonium sidoides and 
Pelargonium reniforme (Geraniaceae), plant species used in folk medicine by the 
Southern African native population, was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, 
including 3 Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 
beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 1451) and 5 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia 
coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
Haemophilus influenzae). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied with 
the preparation of the extracts and microorganisms tested, from about 0.6 mg/ml 
for aqueous phases to over 10 mg/ml for crude Pelargonium extracts. With the 
exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially active compounds 
exhibited antibacterial activities with MICs of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. The 
results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of the titled 
Pelargonium species.

The E. coli anti-sigma factor Rsd: studies on the specificity and regulation of 
its expression.

Hofmann N(1), Wurm R, Wagner R.

Author information:

Düsseldorf, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Among the seven different sigma factors in E. coli σ(70) has the 
highest concentration and affinity for the core RNA polymerase. The E. coli 
protein Rsd is regarded as an anti-sigma factor, inhibiting σ(70)-dependent 
transcription at the onset of stationary growth. Although binding of Rsd to 
σ(70) has been shown and numerous structural studies on Rsd have been performed 
the detailed mechanism of action is still unknown.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have performed studies to unravel the 
function and regulation of Rsd expression in vitro and in vivo. Cross-linking 
and affinity binding revealed that Rsd is able to interact with σ(70), with the 
core enzyme of RNA polymerase and is able to form dimers in solution. 
Unexpectedly, we find that Rsd does also interact with σ(38), the stationary 
phase-specific sigma factor. This interaction was further corroborated by gel 
retardation and footprinting studies with different promoter fragments and 
σ(38)- or σ(70)-containing RNA polymerase in presence of Rsd. Under competitive 
in vitro transcription conditions, in presence of both sigma factors, a 
selective inhibition of σ(70)-dependent transcription was prevailing, however. 
Analysis of rsd expression revealed that the nucleoid-associated proteins H-NS 
and FIS, StpA and LRP bind to the regulatory region of the rsd promoters. 
Furthermore, the major promoter P2 was shown to be down-regulated in vivo by 
RpoS, the stationary phase-specific sigma factor and the transcription factor 
DksA, while induction of the stringent control enhanced rsd promoter activity. 
Most notably, the dam-dependent methylation of a cluster of GATC sites turned 
out to be important for efficient rsd transcription.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results contribute to a better understanding of 
the intricate mechanism of Rsd-mediated sigma factor specificity changes during 
stationary phase.

Characterization of a bordetella pertussis diaminopimelate (DAP) biosynthesis 
locus identifies dapC, a novel gene coding for an N-succinyl-L,L-DAP

The functional complementation of two Escherichia coli strains defective in the 
succinylase pathway of meso-diaminopimelate (meso-DAP) biosynthesis with a 
Bordetella pertussis gene library resulted in the isolation of a putative dap 
operon containing three open reading frames (ORFs). In line with the successful 
complementation of the E. coli dapD and dapE mutants, the deduced amino acid 
sequences of two ORFs revealed significant sequence similarities with the DapD 
and DapE proteins of E. coli and many other bacteria which exhibit 
tetrahydrodipicolinate succinylase and N-succinyl-L,L-DAP desuccinylase 
activity, respectively. The first ORF within the operon showed significant 
sequence similarities with transaminases and contains the characteristic 
pyridoxal-5'-phosphate binding motif. Enzymatic studies revealed that this ORF 
encodes a protein with N-succinyl-L,L-DAP aminotransferase activity converting 
N-succinyl-2-amino-6-ketopimelate, the product of the succinylase DapD, to 
N-succinyl-L,L-DAP, the substrate of the desuccinylase DapE. Therefore, this 
gene appears to encode the DapC protein of B. pertussis. Apart from the 
pyridoxal-5'-phosphate binding motif, the DapC protein does not show further 
amino acid sequence similarities with the only other known enzyme with 
N-succinyl-L,L-DAP aminotransferase activity, ArgD of E. coli.

An intracellular iron chelator pleiotropically suppresses enzymatic and growth 
defects of superoxide dismutase-deficient Escherichia coli.

Maringanti S(1), Imlay JA.

USA.

Mutants of Escherichia coli that lack cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
exhibit auxotrophies for sulfur-containing, branched-chain, and aromatic amino 
acids and cannot catabolize nonfermentable carbon sources. A secondary-site 
mutation substantially relieved all of these growth defects. The requirement for 
fermentable carbon and the branched-chain auxotrophy occur because superoxide 
(O2-) leaches iron from the [4Fe-4S] clusters of a family of dehydratases, 
thereby inactivating them; the suppression of these phenotypes was mediated by 
the restoration of activity to these dehydratases, evidently without changing 
the intracellular concentration of O2-. Cloning, complementation, and sequence 
analysis identified the suppressor mutation to be in dapD, which encodes 
tetrahydrodipicolinate succinylase, an enzyme involved in diaminopimelate and 
lysine biosynthesis. A block in dapB, which encodes dihydrodipicolinate 
reductase in the same pathway, conferred similar protection. Genetic analysis 
indicated that the protection stems from the intracellular accumulation of 
tetrahydro- or dihydrodipicolinate. Heterologous expression in the SOD mutants 
of the dipicolinate synthase of Bacillus subtilis generated dipicolinate and 
similarly protected them. Dipicolinates are excellent iron chelators, and their 
accumulation in the cell triggered derepression of the Fur regulon and a large 
increase in the intracellular pool of free iron, presumably as a dipicolinate 
chelate. A fur mutation only partially relieved the auxotrophies, indicating 
that Fur derepression assists but is not sufficient for suppression. It seems 
plausible that the abundant internal iron permits efficient reactivation of 
superoxide-damaged iron-sulfur clusters. This result provides circumstantial 
evidence that the sulfur and aromatic auxotrophies of SOD mutants are also 
directly or indirectly linked to iron metabolism.

To generate a hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 (HEV-3)-specific monoclonal 
antibody (mAb), the Escherichia coli-expressed carboxy-terminal part of its 
capsid protein was used to immunise BALB/c mice. The immunisation resulted in 
the induction of HEV-specific antibodies of high titre. The mAb G117-AA4 of IgG1 
isotype was obtained showing a strong reactivity with the homologous E. coli, 
but also yeast-expressed capsid protein of HEV-3. The mAb strongly cross-reacted 
with ratHEV capsid protein derivatives produced in both expression systems and 
weaker with an E. coli-expressed batHEV capsid protein fragment. In addition, 
the mAb reacted with capsid protein derivatives of genotypes HEV-2 and HEV-4 and 
common vole hepatitis E virus (cvHEV), produced by the cell-free synthesis in 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cell lysates. 
Western blot and line blot reactivity of the mAb with capsid protein derivatives 
of HEV-1 to HEV-4, cvHEV, ratHEV and batHEV suggested a linear epitope. Use of 
truncated derivatives of ratHEV capsid protein in ELISA, Western blot, and a 
Pepscan analysis allowed to map the epitope within a partially surface-exposed 
region with the amino acid sequence LYTSV. The mAb was also shown to bind to 
human patient-derived HEV-3 from infected cell culture and to hare HEV-3 and 
camel HEV-7 capsid proteins from transfected cells by immunofluorescence assay. 
The novel mAb may serve as a useful tool for further investigations on the 
pathogenesis of HEV infections and might be used for diagnostic purposes. KEY 
POINTS: • The antibody showed cross-reactivity with capsid proteins of different 
hepeviruses. • The linear epitope of the antibody was mapped in a partially 
surface-exposed region. • The antibody detected native HEV-3 antigen in infected 
mammalian cells.

Phytochrome photoreceptors regulate vital adaptations of plant development, 
growth, and physiology depending on the ratio of red and far-red light. The 
light-triggered Z/E isomerization of a covalently bound bilin chromophore 
underlies phytochrome photoconversion between the red-absorbing Pr and 
far-red-absorbing Pfr states. Compared to bacterial phytochromes, the molecular 
mechanisms of signal propagation to the C-terminal module and its regulation are 
little understood in plant phytochromes, not least owing to a dearth of 
structural information. To address this deficit, we studied the Arabidopsis 
thaliana phytochrome A (AtphyA) at full length by cryo-electron microscopy 
(cryo-EM). Following heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, we optimized 
the solvent conditions to overcome protein aggregation and thus obtained 
photochemically active, near-homogenous AtphyA. We prepared grids for cryo-EM 
analysis of AtphyA in its Pr state and conducted single-particle analysis. The 
resulting two-dimensional class averages and the three-dimensional electron 
density map at 17 Å showed a homodimeric head-to-head assembly of AtphyA. 
Docking of domain structures into the electron density revealed a separation of 
the AtphyA homodimer at the junction of its photosensor and effector modules, as 
reflected in a large void in the middle of map. The overall architecture of 
AtphyA resembled that of bacterial phytochromes, thus hinting at commonalities 
in signal transduction and mechanism between these receptors. Our work paves the 
way toward future studies of the structure, light response, and interactions of 
full-length phytochromes by cryo-EM.

The assembly of ribosomal subunits is an essential prerequisite for protein 
biosynthesis in all domains of life. Although biochemical and biophysical 
approaches have advanced our understanding of ribosome assembly, our mechanistic 
comprehension of this process is still limited. Here, we perform an in vitro 
reconstitution of the Escherichia coli 50S ribosomal subunit. Late 
reconstitution products were subjected to high-resolution cryo-electron 
microscopy and multiparticle refinement analysis to reconstruct five distinct 
precursors of the 50S subunit with 4.3-3.8 Å resolution. These assembly 
intermediates define a progressive maturation pathway culminating in a late 
assembly particle, whose structure is more than 96% identical to a mature 50S 
subunit. Our structures monitor the formation and stabilization of structural 
elements in a nascent particle in unprecedented detail and identify the 
maturation of the rRNA-based peptidyl transferase center as the final critical 
step along the 50S assembly pathway.

is found in eye lens, spleen, lung, kidney, cornea, skin, but also in brain. 
Several studies revealed roles of αA/αB-crystallin in regulating cell viability 
and protection in the central nervous system. We previously demonstrated that 
α-crystallin serves as an intracellular protectant in astrocytes. Compared to 
well-studied intracellular functions of α-crystallin, there is limited proof for 
the role of α-crystallin as extracellular protectant. In order to clarify 
protective effects of extracellular αA/αB-crystallin, we exposed astrocytes to 
the toxic agents, staurosporine or C2-ceramide, or serum-starvation in the 
presence of αA/αB-crystallin. Extracellular αA/αB-crystallin protected 
astrocytes from staurosporine- and C2-ceramide-induced cell death. In addition, 
extracellular αB-crystallin/HSPB5 effectively promoted astrocytes viability 
through phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTOR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 
(ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38) and c-Jun N-terminal 
kinases (JNK) signaling pathways under serum-deprivation. Furthermore, 
αB-crystallin/HSPB5 decreases the staurosporine-mediated cleavage of caspase 3 
through PI3K/Akt signaling preventing apoptosis of astrocytes. Thus, the current 
study indicates that extracellular αA/αB-crystallin protects astrocytes exposed 
to various harmful stimuli. Furthermore, application of αB-crystallin/HSPB5 to 
isolated rat brain mitochondria inhibits ROS generation induced by complex III 
inhibition with Antimycin A.

Single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently made significant 
progress in high-resolution structure determination of macromolecular complexes 
due to improvements in electron microscopic instrumentation and computational 
image analysis. However, cryo-EM structures can be highly non-uniform in local 
resolution and all structures available to date have been limited to resolutions 
above 3 Å. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the 70S ribosome from 
Escherichia coli in complex with elongation factor Tu, aminoacyl-tRNA and the 
antibiotic kirromycin at 2.65-2.9 Å resolution using spherical aberration 
(Cs)-corrected cryo-EM. Overall, the cryo-EM reconstruction at 2.9 Å resolution 
is comparable to the best-resolved X-ray structure of the E. coli 70S ribosome 
(2.8 Å), but provides more detailed information (2.65 Å) at the functionally 
important ribosomal core. The cryo-EM map elucidates for the first time the 
structure of all 35 rRNA modifications in the bacterial ribosome, explaining 
their roles in fine-tuning ribosome structure and function and modulating the 
action of antibiotics. We also obtained atomic models for flexible parts of the 
ribosome such as ribosomal proteins L9 and L31. The refined cryo-EM-based model 
presents the currently most complete high-resolution structure of the E. coli 
ribosome, which demonstrates the power of cryo-EM in structure determination of 
large and dynamic macromolecular complexes.

CTB-MPR is a fusion protein between the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) and the 
membrane-proximal region of gp41 (MPR), the transmembrane envelope protein of 
Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), and has previously been shown to induce 
the production of anti-HIV-1 antibodies with antiviral functions. To further 
improve the design of this candidate vaccine, X-ray crystallography experiments 
were performed to obtain structural information about this fusion protein. 
Several variants of CTB-MPR were designed, constructed and recombinantly 
expressed in Escherichia coli. The first variant contained a flexible GPGP 
linker between CTB and MPR, and yielded crystals that diffracted to a resolution 
of 2.3 Å, but only the CTB region was detected in the electron-density map. A 
second variant, in which the CTB was directly attached to MPR, was shown to 
destabilize pentamer formation. A third construct containing a polyalanine 
linker between CTB and MPR proved to stabilize the pentameric form of the 
protein during purification. The purification procedure was shown to produce a 
homogeneously pure and monodisperse sample for crystallization. Initial 
crystallization experiments led to pseudo-crystals which were ordered in only 
two dimensions and were disordered in the third dimension. Nanocrystals obtained 
using the same precipitant showed promising X-ray diffraction to 5 Å resolution 
in femtosecond nanocrystallography experiments at the Linac Coherent Light 
Source at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The results demonstrate the 
utility of femtosecond X-ray crystallography to enable structural analysis based 
on nano/microcrystals of a protein for which no macroscopic crystals ordered in 
three dimensions have been observed before.

We introduce a general hybrid approach for determining the structures of 
supramolecular assemblies. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data define the 
overall envelope of the assembly and rigid-body orientation of the subunits 
while solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) chemical shifts and 
distance constraints define the local secondary structure, protein fold and 
inter-subunit interactions. Finally, Rosetta structure calculations provide a 
general framework to integrate the different sources of structural information. 
Combining a 7.7-Å cryo-EM density map and 996 ssNMR distance constraints, the 
structure of the type-III secretion system needle of Shigella flexneri is 
determined to a precision of 0.4 Å. The calculated structures are 
cross-validated using an independent data set of 691 ssNMR constraints and 
scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. The hybrid model 
resolves the conformation of the non-conserved N terminus, which occupies a 
protrusion in the cryo-EM density, and reveals conserved pore residues forming a 
continuous pattern of electrostatic interactions, thereby suggesting a mechanism 
for effector protein translocation.

coli.

The acyl esterase Aes effectively inhibits the transcriptional activity of 
MalT-the central activator of maltose and maltodextrin utilizing genes in 
Escherichia coli. To provide better insight into the nature of the interaction 
between Aes and MalT, we determined two different crystal structures of Aes-in 
its native form and covalently modified by a phenylmethylsulfonyl moiety at its 
active site serine. Both structures show distinct space groups and were refined 
to a resolution of 1.8 Å and 2.3 Å, respectively. The overall structure of Aes 
resembles a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold, which is extended by a funnel-like cap 
structure that forms the substrate-binding site. The catalytic triad of Aes, 
comprising residues Ser165, His292, and Asp262, is located at the bottom of this 
funnel. Analysis of the crystal-packing contacts of the two different space 
groups as well as analytical size-exclusion chromatography revealed a 
homodimeric arrangement of Aes. The Aes dimer adopts an antiparallel contact 
involving both the hydrolase core and the cap, with its twofold axis 
perpendicular to the largest dimension of Aes. To identify the surface area of 
Aes that is responsible for the interaction with MalT, we performed a 
structure-based alanine-scanning mutagenesis to pinpoint Aes residues that are 
significantly impaired in MalT inhibition, but still exhibit wild-type 
expression and enzymatic activity. These residues map to a shallow slightly 
concave surface patch of Aes at the opposite site of the dimerization interface 
and indicate the surface area that interacts with MalT.

Dynamic enzyme docking to the ribosome coordinates N-terminal processing with 
polypeptide folding.

Newly synthesized polypeptides undergo various cotranslational maturation steps, 
including N-terminal enzymatic processing, chaperone-assisted folding and 
membrane targeting, but the spatial and temporal coordination of these steps is 
unclear. We show that Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase (MAP) 
associates with ribosomes through a charged loop that is crucial for 
nascent-chain processing and cell viability. MAP competes with peptide 
deformylase (PDF), the first enzyme to act on nascent chains, for binding sites 
at the ribosomal tunnel exit. PDF has extremely fast association and 
dissociation kinetics, which allows it to frequently sample ribosomes and ensure 
the processing of nascent chains after their emergence. Premature recruitment of 
the chaperone trigger factor, or polypeptide folding, negatively affect 
processing efficiency. Thus, the fast ribosome association kinetics of PDF and 
MAP are crucial for the temporal separation of nascent-chain processing from 
later maturation events, including chaperone recruitment and folding.

Visualizing evolution in real time to determine the molecular mechanisms of 
n-butanol tolerance in Escherichia coli.

Toxicity of products or feedstock components poses a challenge in the 
biocatalyst-based production of fuels and chemicals. The genetic determinants 
that are involved in increased resistance to an inhibitor form the adaptive 
landscape for the phenotype; so in order to engineer more robust biocatalysts, a 
better understanding of the adaptive landscape is required. Here, we used an 
adaptive laboratory evolution method called visualizing evolution in real time 
(VERT) to help map out part of the adaptive landscape of Escherichia coli 
tolerance to the biofuel n-butanol. VERT enables identification of adaptive 
events (population expansions triggered by adaptive mutants) via visualization 
of the relative proportions of different fluorescently-labeled cells. Knowledge 
of the occurrence of adaptive events allows for a more systematic isolation of 
adaptive mutants while simultaneously reducing the number of missed adaptive 
mutants (and the underlying adaptive mechanisms) that result from clonal 
interference during the course of in vitro evolution. Based on the evolutionary 
dynamics observed, clonal interference was found to play a significant role in 
shaping the population structure of E. coli during exposure to n-butanol, and 
VERT helped to facilitate the isolation of adaptive mutants from the population. 
We further combined adaptive laboratory evolution with genome shuffling to 
significantly enhance the desired n-butanol tolerance phenotype. Subsequent 
transcriptome analysis of the isolated adaptive mutants revealed different 
mechanisms of n-butanol resistance in different lineages. In one 
fluorescently-marked subpopulation, members of the Fur regulon were upregulated; 
which was not observed in the other subpopulation. In addition, genome 
sequencing of several adaptive mutants revealed the genetic basis for some of 
the observed transcriptome profiles. We further elucidated the potential role of 
the iron-related gene in n-butanol tolerance via overexpression and deletion 
studies and hypothesized that the upregulation of the iron-related genes 
indirectly led to modifications in the outer membrane, which contributed to 
enhanced n-butanol tolerance.

Lipoproteins of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria carry a thioether-bound 
diacylglycerol but differ by a fatty acid amide bound to the alpha-amino group 
of the universally conserved cysteine. In Escherichia coli the N-terminal 
acylation is catalyzed by the N-acyltransferase Lnt. Using E. coli Lnt as a 
query in a BLASTp search, we identified putative lnt genes also in Gram-positive 
mycobacteria. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoprotein LppX, heterologously 
expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis, was N-acylated at the N-terminal cysteine, 
whereas LppX expressed in a M. smegmatis lnt::aph knock-out mutant was 
accessible for N-terminal sequencing. Western blot analyses of a truncated and 
tagged form of LppX indicated a smaller size of about 0.3 kDa in the lnt::aph 
mutant compared with the parental strain. Matrix-assisted laser desorption 
ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight analyses of a trypsin digest of LppX 
proved the presence of the diacylglycerol modification in both strains, the 
parental strain and lnt::aph mutant. N-Acylation was found exclusively in the M. 
smegmatis parental strain. Complementation of the lnt::aph mutant with M. 
tuberculosis ppm1 restored N-acylation. The substrate for N-acylation is a C16 
fatty acid, whereas the two fatty acids of the diacylglycerol residue were 
identified as C16 and C19:0 fatty acid, the latter most likely tuberculostearic 
acid. We demonstrate that mycobacterial lipoproteins are triacylated. For the 
first time to our knowledge, we identify Lnt activity in Gram-positive bacteria 
and assigned the responsible genes. In M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis the open 
reading frames are annotated as MSMEG_3860 and M. tuberculosis ppm1, 
respectively.

A modified pathway for the production of acetone in Escherichia coli.

A modified synthetic acetone operon was constructed. It consists of two genes 
from Clostridium acetobutylicum (thlA coding for thiolase and adc coding for 
acetoacetate decarboxylase) and one from Bacillus subtilis or Haemophilus 
influenzae (teII(srf) or ybgC, respectively, for thioesterase). Expression of 
this operon in Escherichia coli resulted in the production of acetone starting 
from the common metabolite acetyl-CoA via acetoacetyl-CoA and acetoacetate. The 
thioesterases do not need a CoA acceptor for acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolysis. Thus, 
in contrast to the classic acetone pathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum and 
related microorganisms which employ a CoA transferase, the new pathway is 
acetate independent. The genetic background of the host strains was crucial. 
Only E. coli strains HB101 and WL3 were able to produce acetone via the modified 
plasmid based pathway, up to 64mM and 42mM in 5-ml cultures, respectively. Using 
glucose fed-batch cultures the concentration could be increased up to 122mM 
acetone with HB101 carrying the recombinant plasmid pUC19ayt (thioesterase from 
H. influenzae). The formation of acetone led to a decreased acetate production 
by E. coli.

Iron acquisition in the dental pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans: 
what does it use as a source and how does it get this essential metal?

Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans requires iron to grow under limiting 
conditions imposed by synthetic and natural chelators. Although none of the 
strains tested used hemoglobin, lactoferrin or transferrin, all of them used 
FeCl3 and hemin as iron sources under chelated conditions. Dot-blot binding 
assays showed that all strains bind lactoferrin, hemoglobin, and hemin but not 
transferrin. When compared with smooth strains, the rough isolates showed higher 
hemin binding activity, which was sensitive to proteinase K treatment. A. 
actinomycetemcomitans harbors the Fur-regulated afeABCD locus coding for iron 
acquisition in isogenic and non-isogenic cell backgrounds. The genome of this 
oral pathogen also harbors several other predicted iron uptake genes including 
the hitABC locus, which restored iron acquisition in the E. coli 1017 ent 
mutant. However, the disruption of this locus in the parental strain did not 
affect iron acquisition as drastically as the inactivation of AfeABCD, 
suggesting that the latter system could be more involved in iron transport than 
the HitABC system. The genome of this oral pathogen also harbors an active copy 
of the exbBexbDtonB operon, which could provide the energy needed for hemin 
acquisition. However, inactivation of each coding region of this operon did not 
affect the hemin and iron acquisition phenotypes of isogenic derivatives. This 
observation suggests that the function of these proteins could be replaced by 
those coded for by tolQ, tolR and tolA as it was described for other bacterial 
transport systems. Interruption of a hasR homolog, an actively transcribed gene 
that is predicted to code for an outer membrane hemophore receptor protein, did 
not affect the ability of an isogenic derivative to bind and use hemin under 
chelated conditions. This result also indicates that A. actinomycetemcomitans 
could produce more than one outer membrane hemin receptor as it was described in 
other human pathogens. All strains tested formed biofilms on plastic under 
iron-rich and iron-chelated conditions. However, smooth strains attached poorly 
and formed weaker biofilms when compared with rough isolates. The incubation of 
rough cells in the presence of FeCl3 or hemin resulted in an increased number of 
smaller aggregates and microcolonies as compared to the fewer but larger 
aggregates formed when cells were grown in the presence of dipyridyl.

RegA, iron, and growth phase regulate expression of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa

The tol-oprL region in Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be involved in pyocin 
uptake and required for cell viability. The complete nucleotide sequences of the 
tolQRA and oprL genes as well as the incomplete sequences of tolB and orf2 have 
been previously reported. In addition, the sequence of a P. aeruginosa 
iron-regulated gene (pig6) has been described and found to share homology with 
an open reading frame located upstream of the Escherichia coli tolQRA genes (U. 
A. Ochsner and M. L. Vasil, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:4409-4414, 1996). In 
this study, we cloned the remainder of the P. aeruginosa tol-oprL gene cluster 
and determined its nucleotide sequence. This cluster was found to consist of 
seven genes in the order orf1 tolQ tolR tolA tolB oprL orf2. Transcriptional 
analysis of this gene cluster was performed by detecting the presence of mRNAs 
spanning adjacent genes as well as by using a promoterless lacZ reporter gene 
fused to each of the seven genes contained in the tol-oprL locus. The results 
show that there are three major transcriptional units or operons in this region, 
orf1-tolQRA, tolB, and oprL-orf2, in contrast to the E. coli tol-pal region, 
where there are only two operons, orf1-tolQRA and tolB-pal-orf2. Analysis of 
gene expression indicated that the tol-oprL genes of P. aeruginosa are both iron 
and growth phase modulated. The first operon, orf1-tolQRA, is iron regulated 
throughout growth, but iron-regulated expression of tolB and oprL fusions occurs 
only in late log phase. The expression of the three operons was significantly 
less repressed by iron in fur mutants than in the wild-type strain, suggesting 
the involvement of Fur in the iron regulation of all three operons. RegA is a 
positive yet nonessential regulator of tol-oprL expression.

The tolQRA genes have been recently identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO. In 
this study, we examined the effect of iron and temperature on tolQRA expression. 
A promoterless lacZ gene was introduced downstream of plasmid-encoded tolQ and 
tolA, and expression was monitored by measuring beta-galactosidase activity of 
cultures. Addition of 25 microM FeCl3 to the culture medium reduced tolQRA 
expression by 50 to 60% in PAO but by only 25% in the fur mutant PAO A4. 
Northern hybridization analysis revealed that iron regulation occurs at the 
level of transcription and involves the P. aeruginosa ferric uptake regulator 
(Fur). Primer extension analysis was used to identify the proposed 
transcriptional start site of tolA. Although a putative Fur box was identified 
20 bp upstream of the proposed start site, purified Fur did not bind to the tolA 
or tolQR promoter regions in an in vitro gel retardation assay. Therefore, iron 
regulation of the tol genes appears to involve an intermediate regulatory gene. 
Expression of tolQR and tolA was optimal at 37 degrees C and was reduced by 40 
to 50% when cultures were grown at either 42 or 25 degreesC. Growth in high-iron 
medium at 25 degrees C further reduced tolQR and tolA expression.

Gene repression by the ferric uptake regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: cycle 
selection of iron-regulated genes.

The expression of at least 24 distinct genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is 
under direct control of the "ferric uptake regulator" (Fur). Novel targets of 
the Fur protein were isolated in a powerful SELEX (systematic evolution of 
ligands by exponential enrichment)-like cycle selection consisting of in vitro 
DNA-Fur interaction, binding to anti-Fur antibody, purification on protein G, 
and PCR amplification. DNA fragments obtained after at least three exponential 
enrichment cycles were cloned and subjected to DNA mobility-shift assays and 
DNase I footprint analyses to verify the specific interaction with the Fur 
protein in vitro. Iron-dependent expression of the corresponding genes in vivo 
was monitored by RNase protection analysis. In total, 20 different DNA fragments 
were identified which represent actual Pseudomonas iron-regulated genes (PIGs). 
While four PIGs are identical to already known genes (pfeR, pvdS, tonB, and 
fumC, respectively), 16 PIGs represent previously unknown genes. Homology 
studies of the putative proteins encoded by the PIGs allowed us to speculate 
about their possible function. Two PIG products were highly similar to 
siderophore receptors from various species, and three PIG products were 
significantly homologous to alternative sigma factors. Furthermore, homologs of 
the Escherichia coli ORF1-tolQ, nuoA, stringent starvation protein Ssp, and of a 
two-component regulatory system similar to the Pseudomonas syringae LemA sensor 
kinase were identified. The putative gene products of seven additional PIGs did 
not show significant homologies to any known proteins. The PIGs were mapped on 
the P.aeruginosa chromosome. Their possible role in iron metabolism and 
virulence of P. aeruginosa is discussed.

what does it use as a source and how does it get this essential metal?

Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans requires iron to grow under limiting 
conditions imposed by synthetic and natural chelators. Although none of the 
strains tested used hemoglobin, lactoferrin or transferrin, all of them used 
FeCl3 and hemin as iron sources under chelated conditions. Dot-blot binding 
assays showed that all strains bind lactoferrin, hemoglobin, and hemin but not 
transferrin. When compared with smooth strains, the rough isolates showed higher 
hemin binding activity, which was sensitive to proteinase K treatment. A. 
actinomycetemcomitans harbors the Fur-regulated afeABCD locus coding for iron 
acquisition in isogenic and non-isogenic cell backgrounds. The genome of this 
oral pathogen also harbors several other predicted iron uptake genes including 
the hitABC locus, which restored iron acquisition in the E. coli 1017 ent 
mutant. However, the disruption of this locus in the parental strain did not 
affect iron acquisition as drastically as the inactivation of AfeABCD, 
suggesting that the latter system could be more involved in iron transport than 
the HitABC system. The genome of this oral pathogen also harbors an active copy 
of the exbBexbDtonB operon, which could provide the energy needed for hemin 
acquisition. However, inactivation of each coding region of this operon did not 
affect the hemin and iron acquisition phenotypes of isogenic derivatives. This 
observation suggests that the function of these proteins could be replaced by 
those coded for by tolQ, tolR and tolA as it was described for other bacterial 
transport systems. Interruption of a hasR homolog, an actively transcribed gene 
that is predicted to code for an outer membrane hemophore receptor protein, did 
not affect the ability of an isogenic derivative to bind and use hemin under 
chelated conditions. This result also indicates that A. actinomycetemcomitans 
could produce more than one outer membrane hemin receptor as it was described in 
other human pathogens. All strains tested formed biofilms on plastic under 
iron-rich and iron-chelated conditions. However, smooth strains attached poorly 
and formed weaker biofilms when compared with rough isolates. The incubation of 
rough cells in the presence of FeCl3 or hemin resulted in an increased number of 
smaller aggregates and microcolonies as compared to the fewer but larger 
aggregates formed when cells were grown in the presence of dipyridyl.

The tol-oprL region in Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be involved in pyocin 
uptake and required for cell viability. The complete nucleotide sequences of the 
tolQRA and oprL genes as well as the incomplete sequences of tolB and orf2 have 
been previously reported. In addition, the sequence of a P. aeruginosa 
iron-regulated gene (pig6) has been described and found to share homology with 
an open reading frame located upstream of the Escherichia coli tolQRA genes (U. 
A. Ochsner and M. L. Vasil, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:4409-4414, 1996). In 
this study, we cloned the remainder of the P. aeruginosa tol-oprL gene cluster 
and determined its nucleotide sequence. This cluster was found to consist of 
seven genes in the order orf1 tolQ tolR tolA tolB oprL orf2. Transcriptional 
analysis of this gene cluster was performed by detecting the presence of mRNAs 
spanning adjacent genes as well as by using a promoterless lacZ reporter gene 
fused to each of the seven genes contained in the tol-oprL locus. The results 
show that there are three major transcriptional units or operons in this region, 
orf1-tolQRA, tolB, and oprL-orf2, in contrast to the E. coli tol-pal region, 
where there are only two operons, orf1-tolQRA and tolB-pal-orf2. Analysis of 
gene expression indicated that the tol-oprL genes of P. aeruginosa are both iron 
and growth phase modulated. The first operon, orf1-tolQRA, is iron regulated 
throughout growth, but iron-regulated expression of tolB and oprL fusions occurs 
only in late log phase. The expression of the three operons was significantly 
less repressed by iron in fur mutants than in the wild-type strain, suggesting 
the involvement of Fur in the iron regulation of all three operons. RegA is a 
positive yet nonessential regulator of tol-oprL expression.

To initiate infection of Escherichia coli, phage fd uses its gene-3-protein 
(G3P) to bind first to an F pilus and then to the TolA protein at the cell 
surface. G3P is normally auto-inhibited because a tight interaction between the 
two N-terminal domains N1 and N2 buries the TolA binding site. Binding of N2 to 
the pilus activates G3P by initiating long-range conformational changes that are 
relayed to the domain interface and to a proline timer. We discovered that the 
23-28 loop of the N1 domain is critical for propagating these conformational 
signals. The analysis of the stability and the folding dynamics of G3P variants 
with a shortened loop combined with TolA interaction studies and phage infection 
experiments reveal how the contact between the N2 domain and the 23-28 loop of 
N1 is energetically linked with the interdomain region and the proline timer and 
how it affects phage infectivity. Our results illustrate how conformational 
transitions and prolyl cis/trans isomerization can be coupled energetically and 
how conformational signals to and from prolines can be propagated over long 
distances in proteins.

Infection of Escherichia coli by the filamentous phage fd starts with the 
binding of the N2 domain of the phage gene-3-protein to an F pilus. This 
interaction triggers partial unfolding of the gene-3-protein, cis → trans 
isomerization at Pro-213, and domain disassembly, thereby exposing its binding 
site for the ultimate receptor TolA. The trans-proline sets a molecular timer to 
maintain the binding-active state long enough for the phage to interact with 
TolA. We elucidated the changes in structure and local stability that lead to 
partial unfolding and thus to the activation of the gene-3-protein for phage 
infection. Protein folding and TolA binding experiments were combined with 
real-time NMR spectroscopy, amide hydrogen exchange measurements, and phage 
infectivity assays. In combination, the results provide a molecular picture of 
how a local unfolding reaction couples with prolyl isomerization not only to 
generate the activated state of a protein but also to maintain it for an 
extended time.

Structural and energetic basis of infection by the filamentous bacteriophage 
IKe.

Filamentous phage use the two N-terminal domains of their gene-3-proteins to 
initiate infection of Escherichia coli. One domain interacts with a pilus, and 
then the other domain binds to TolA at the cell surface. In phage fd, these two 
domains are tightly associated with each other, which renders the phage robust 
but non-infectious, because the TolA binding site is inaccessible. Activation 
for infection requires partial unfolding, domain disassembly and prolyl 
isomerization. Phage IKe infects E. coli less efficiently than phage fd. Unlike 
in phage fd, the pilus- and TolA-binding domains of phage IKe are independent of 
each other in stability and folding. The site for TolA binding is thus always 
accessible, but the affinity is very low. The structures of the two domains, 
analysed by X-ray crystallography and by NMR spectroscopy, revealed a unique 
fold for the N-pilus-binding domain and a conserved fold for the TolA-binding 
domain. The absence of an activation mechanism as in phage fd and the low 
affinity for TolA probably explain the low infectivity of phage IKe. They also 
explain why, in a previous co-evolution experiment with a mixture of phage fd 
and phage IKe, all hybrid phage adopted the superior infection mechanism of 
phage fd.

Reprogramming the infection mechanism of a filamentous phage.

When they infect Escherichia coli cells, the filamentous phages IF1 and fd first 
interact with a pilus and then target TolA as their common receptor. They use 
the domains N2 and N1 of their gene-3-proteins (G3P) for these interactions but 
differ in the mechanism of infection. In G3P of phage IF1, N1 and N2 are 
independent modules that are permanently binding-active. G3P of phage fd is 
usually in a closed state in which N1 and N2 are tightly associated. The TolA 
binding site is thus inaccessible and the phage incompetent for infection. 
Partial unfolding and prolyl isomerization must occur to abolish the domain 
interactions and expose the TolA binding site. This complex mechanism of phage 
fd could be changed to the simple infection mechanism of phage IF1 by 
reprogramming its G3P following physicochemical rules of protein stability. The 
redesigned phage fd was robust and as infectious as wild-type phage fd.

The filamentous phages fd and IF1 use different mechanisms to infect Escherichia 
coli.

The filamentous phage fd uses its gene 3 protein (G3P) to target Escherichia 
coli cells in a two-step process. First, the N2 domain of G3P attaches to an F 
pilus, and then the N1 domain binds to TolA-C. N1 and N2 are tightly associated, 
rendering the phage robust but noninfectious because the binding site for TolA-C 
is buried at the domain interface. Binding of N2 to the F pilus initiates 
partial unfolding, domain disassembly, and prolyl cis-to-trans isomerization in 
the hinge between N1 and N2. This activates the phage, and trans-Pro213 
maintains this state long enough for N1 to reach TolA-C. Phage IF1 targets I 
pili, and its G3P contains also an N1 domain and an N2 domain. The pilus-binding 
N2 domains of the phages IF1 and fd are unrelated, and the N1 domains share a 
31% sequence identity. We show that N2 of phage IF1 mediates binding to the I 
pilus, and that N1 targets TolA. Crystallographic and NMR analyses of the 
complex between N1 and TolA-C indicate that phage IF1 interacts with the same 
site on TolA-C as phage fd. In IF1-G3P, N1 and N2 are independently folding 
units, however, and the TolA binding site on N1 is permanently accessible. 
Activation by unfolding and prolyl isomerization, as in the case of phage fd, is 
not observed. In IF1-G3P, the absence of stabilizing domain interactions is 
compensated for by a strong increase in the stabilities of the individual 
domains. Apparently, these closely related filamentous phages evolved different 
mechanisms to reconcile robustness with high infectivity.

A conformational unfolding reaction activates phage fd for the infection of 
Escherichia coli.

Unfolding usually leads to the loss of the biological function of a protein. 
Here, we show that an unfolding reaction activates the gene-3-protein of the 
filamentous phage fd for its function during the infection of Escherichia coli. 
Before infection, the gene-3-protein is in a fully folded locked form, in which 
the binding site for the phage receptor TolA is buried at the domain interface. 
To expose this binding site, the gene-3-protein must be activated, and 
previously we identified the cis-to-trans isomerization at Pro213 in the hinge 
region between the two domains as a key step of activation. We now report that 
Pro213 isomerization destabilizes the protein and leads to a loss of folded 
structure, presumably in the hinge region. The partially unfolded form of the 
gene-3-protein is metastable, and trans-Pro213 arrests the protein in this 
activated form for an extended time, long enough to find the receptor TolA. The 
partial unfolding and its timing by prolyl isomerization are essential for the 
biological function.

A proline switch controls folding and domain interactions in the gene-3-protein

The amino-terminal domains N1 and N2 of the gene-3-protein of phage fd form a 
bilobal structural and functional entity that protrudes from the phage tip. 
Domain N2 initiates the infection of Escherichia coli by binding to the F pilus. 
This binding results in the dissociation of the two domains and allows N1 to 
interact with the TolA receptor at the cell surface. The refolding of the N1-N2 
fragment begins with the folding of domain N1, which takes a few milliseconds, 
followed by the folding of domain N2, which is complete within five minutes. The 
subsequent domain assembly is unusually slow and shows a time-constant of 6200 s 
at 25 degrees C. We found that the rate of this reaction is controlled by the 
trans to cis isomerization of the Gln212-Pro213 bond in the hinge subdomain of 
N2, a region that provides many interactions between N1 and N2 in the 
gene-3-protein. The substitution of Pro213 by Gly accelerated domain association 
30-fold and revealed that the folding of the two individual domains and their 
assembly are indeed sequential steps in the refolding of the gene-3-protein. In 
the course of infection, the domains must separate to expose the binding site 
for TolA on domain N1. The kinetic block of domain reassembly caused by Pro213 
isomerization could ensure that after the initial binding of N2 to the F pilus 
the open state persists until N1 and TolA are close enough for their mutual 
interaction. Pro213 isomerization might thus serve as a slow conformational 
switch in the function of the gene-3-protein.

The gene-3 protein (G3P) of filamentous phages is essential for the infection of 
Escherichia coli. The carboxy-terminal domain anchors this protein in the phage 
coat, whereas the two amino-terminal domains N1 and N2 protrude from the phage 
surface. We analyzed the folding mechanism of the two-domain fragment N1-N2 of 
G3P (G3P(*)) and the interplay between folding and domain assembly. For this 
analysis, a variant of G3P(*) was used that contained four stabilizing mutations 
(IIHY-G3P(*)). The observed refolding kinetics extend from 10 ms to several 
hours. Domain N1 refolds very rapidly (with a time constant of 9.4 ms at 0.5 M 
guanidinium chloride, 25 degrees C) both as a part of IIHY-G3P(*) and as an 
isolated protein fragment. The refolding of domain N2 is slower and involves two 
reactions with time constants of seven seconds and 42 seconds. These folding 
reactions of the individual domains are followed by a very slow, 
spectroscopically silent docking process, which shows a time constant of 6200 
seconds. This reaction was detected by a kinetic unfolding assay for native 
molecules. Before docking, N1 and N2 unfold fast and independently, after 
docking they unfold slowly in a correlated fashion. A high energy barrier is 
thus created by domain docking, which protects G3P kinetically against 
unfolding. The slow domain docking is possibly important for the infection of 
E.coli by the phage. Upon binding to the F pilus, the N2 domain separates from 
N1 and the binding site for TolA on domain N1 is exposed. Since domain 
reassembly is so slow, this binding site remains accessible until pilus 
retraction has brought N1 close to TolA on the bacterial surface.

principles that govern the thermodynamic stability of two-domain proteins.

The gene-3-protein (G3P) of filamentous phage is essential for their 
propagation. It consists of three domains. The CT domain anchors G3P in the 
phage coat, the N2 domain binds to the F pilus of Escherichia coli and thus 
initiates infection, and the N1 domain continues by interacting with the TolA 
receptor. Phage are thus only infective when the three domains of G3P are 
tightly linked, and this requirement is exploited by Proside, an in vitro 
selection method for proteins with increased stability. In Proside, a repertoire 
of variants of the protein to be stabilized is inserted between the N2 and the 
CT domains of G3P. Stabilized variants can be selected because they resist 
cleavage by a protease and thus maintain the essential linkage between the 
domains. The method is limited by the proteolytic stability of G3P itself. We 
improved the stability of G3P by subjecting the phage without a guest protein to 
rounds of random in vivo mutagenesis and proteolytic Proside selections. 
Variants of G3P with one to four mutations were selected, and the temperature at 
which the corresponding phage became accessible for a protease increased in a 
stepwise manner from 40 degrees C to almost 60 degrees C. The N1-N2 fragments of 
wild-type gene-3-protein and of the four selected variants were purified and 
their stabilities towards thermal and denaturant-induced unfolding were 
determined. In the biphasic transitions of these proteins domain dissociation 
and unfolding of N2 occur in a concerted reaction in the first step, followed by 
the independent unfolding of domain N1 in the second step. N2 is thus less 
stable than N1, and it unfolds when the interactions with N1 are broken. The 
strongest stabilizations were caused by mutations in domain N2, in particular in 
its hinge subdomain, which provides many stabilizing interactions between the N1 
and N2 domains. These results reveal how the individual domains and their 
assembly contribute to the overall stability of two-domain proteins and how 
mutations are optimally placed to improve the stability of such proteins.

Antibody phage display is a key technology for the generation of recombinant 
(human) antibodies for research, diagnostics and therapy. Most antibody 
fragments can only be folded correctly in the oxidizing environment of the 
periplasm of Escherichia coli. A multitude of leader peptides has been used for 
secretion of antibody::pIII fusion proteins into the periplasm, but a systematic 
study of their impact on the performance of antibody phage display systems has 
not been reported so far. In this work we have analysed the influence of various 
leader peptides on antibody phage display efficiency and production yields of 
soluble antibody fragments. Four leader peptides using the Sec pathway (PelB, 
OmpA, PhoA and pIII) and three using the SRP pathway (DsbA, TorT and TolB) were 
compared. Both pathways are compatible with antibody phage display and the 
production of soluble antibody fragments. The applicability of the SRP pathway 
to antibody phage display and the production of functional scFvs is shown here 
for the first time.

The tol-oprL region in Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be involved in pyocin 
uptake and required for cell viability. The complete nucleotide sequences of the 
tolQRA and oprL genes as well as the incomplete sequences of tolB and orf2 have 
been previously reported. In addition, the sequence of a P. aeruginosa 
iron-regulated gene (pig6) has been described and found to share homology with 
an open reading frame located upstream of the Escherichia coli tolQRA genes (U. 
A. Ochsner and M. L. Vasil, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:4409-4414, 1996). In 
this study, we cloned the remainder of the P. aeruginosa tol-oprL gene cluster 
and determined its nucleotide sequence. This cluster was found to consist of 
seven genes in the order orf1 tolQ tolR tolA tolB oprL orf2. Transcriptional 
analysis of this gene cluster was performed by detecting the presence of mRNAs 
spanning adjacent genes as well as by using a promoterless lacZ reporter gene 
fused to each of the seven genes contained in the tol-oprL locus. The results 
show that there are three major transcriptional units or operons in this region, 
orf1-tolQRA, tolB, and oprL-orf2, in contrast to the E. coli tol-pal region, 
where there are only two operons, orf1-tolQRA and tolB-pal-orf2. Analysis of 
gene expression indicated that the tol-oprL genes of P. aeruginosa are both iron 
and growth phase modulated. The first operon, orf1-tolQRA, is iron regulated 
throughout growth, but iron-regulated expression of tolB and oprL fusions occurs 
only in late log phase. The expression of the three operons was significantly 
less repressed by iron in fur mutants than in the wild-type strain, suggesting 
the involvement of Fur in the iron regulation of all three operons. RegA is a 
positive yet nonessential regulator of tol-oprL expression.

Two isoforms of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) have been isolated as cDNA 
sequences from the hornwort Anthoceros agrestis. The encoded enzymes convert 
L-phenylalanine and to lower extents L-tyrosine and L-histidine. Thus, the 
functional presence of the general phenylpropanoid pathway in one of the 
earliest land plant groups is established. The hornwort Anthoceros agrestis has 
an elaborated phenolic metabolism resulting in phenolic compounds, such as 
rosmarinic acid or megacerotonic acid. The general phenylpropanoid pathway is 
involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds. Two phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 
(PAL) genes, AaPAL1 and AaPAL2, have been identified in Anthoceros agrestis and 
the protein with an N-terminal 6xHis-tag heterologously synthesized in 
Escherichia coli for a full biochemical characterization. Both PAL proteins 
accept L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine as well as L-histidine as substrates, 
although the activity is explicitly the highest with L-phenylalanine. Km values 
as well as catalytic efficiencies were determined for phenylalanine (Km AaPAL1 
39 µM, AaPAL2 18 µM) and tyrosine (Km AaPAL1 3.3 mM, AaPAL2 3.5 mM). In 
suspension cultures of Anthoceros agrestis, PAL genes were transcribed in 
parallel to rosmarinic acid (RA) accumulation and both showed highest abundance 
in the early growth phase. In a phylogenetic tree, both AaPAL amino acid 
sequences grouped within a clade with PAL amino acid sequences of diverse origin 
ranging from non-vascular to vascular plants, while most PALs from eudicots and 
monocots were mainly found in two other clades. The similarity of the hornwort 
PAL amino acid sequences to PAL sequences from vascular plants is more than 80% 
showing a strong conservation within the land plants. With this characterization 
of PALs from Anthoceros agrestis together with former investigations concerning 
cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase and 4-coumaric acid CoA-ligase, the functional 
presence of the general phenylpropanoid pathway in this hornwort is proven.

Evolution of antibiotic resistance in microbes is frequently achieved by 
acquisition of spontaneous mutations during antimicrobial therapy. Here, we 
demonstrate that inactivation of a central transcriptional regulator of iron 
homeostasis (Fur) facilitates laboratory evolution of ciprofloxacin resistance 
in Escherichia coli. To decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms, we first 
performed a global transcriptome analysis and demonstrated that the set of genes 
regulated by Fur changes substantially in response to antibiotic treatment. We 
hypothesized that the impact of Fur on evolvability under antibiotic pressure is 
due to the elevated intracellular concentration of free iron and the consequent 
enhancement of oxidative damage-induced mutagenesis. In agreement with 
expectations, overexpression of iron storage proteins, inhibition of iron 
transport, or anaerobic conditions drastically suppressed the evolution of 
resistance, whereas inhibition of the SOS response-mediated mutagenesis had only 
a minor effect. Finally, we provide evidence that a cell permeable iron chelator 
inhibits the evolution of resistance. In sum, our work revealed the central role 
of iron metabolism in the de novo evolution of antibiotic resistance, a pattern 
that could influence the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.

cell cultures.

Sorbus aucuparia cell cultures accumulate biphenyl and dibenzofuran phytoalexins 
in response to elicitor treatment. These polyketide derivatives arise from the 
starter substrate benzoyl-CoA, the biosynthesis of which is largely unresolved. 
Two CoA ligases involved are cinnamate:CoA ligase and benzoate:CoA ligase, which 
were assumed to be related in S. aucuparia to the ubiquitous 4-coumarate:CoA 
ligase (4CL). cDNAs encoding three distinct 4CLs from elicitor-treated S. 
aucuparia cell cultures were isolated using RT-PCR and RACE techniques and 
functionally expressed in Escherichia coli as His(6)-tagged proteins (Sa4CL2 and 
Sa4CL3) or GST-fusion protein (Sa4CL1). All three isoenzymes preferred 
4-coumaric acid over cinnamic acid in spectrophotometric assays and failed to 
utilize benzoic acid in radioisotopic assays. After elicitor treatment of S. 
aucuparia cell cultures, the transcript levels of all three Sa4CLs increased but 
were significantly lower than the maximum expression rates of the phenylalanine 
ammonia-lyase (PAL) and biphenyl synthase 1 (BIS1) genes. The substrate 
specificities and the expression profiles indicate that the three 4CL isoenzymes 
are not involved in benzoyl-CoA biosynthesis in S. aucuparia cell cultures. 
Sa4CL3 and PAL transcripts also accumulated in response to light treatment. 
Phylogenetically, Sa4CL1 and Sa4CL2 belong to the class I cluster and Sa4CL3 
groups in the class II cluster. Sa4CL3 contains a 49-amino acid N-terminal 
extension, which includes a chloroplast sorting signal.

Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis, Lamiaceae) is a well-known medicinal plant. 
Amongst the biologically active ingredients are a number of phenolic compounds, 
the most prominent of which is rosmarinic acid. To obtain better knowledge of 
the biosynthesis of these phenolic compounds, two enzymes of the general 
phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and 
4-coumarate:coenzyme A-ligase (4CL), were investigated in suspension cultures of 
lemon balm. MoPAL1 and Mo4CL1 cDNAs were cloned and heterologously expressed in 
Escherichia coli and the enzymes characterised. Expression analysis of both 
genes showed a correlation with the enzyme activities and rosmarinic acid 
content during a cultivation period of the suspension culture. Southern-blot 
analysis suggested the presence of most probably two gene copies in the M. 
officinalis genome of both PAL and 4CL. The genomic DNA sequences of MoPAL1 and 
Mo4CL1 were amplified and sequenced. MoPAL1 contains one phase 2 intron of 836 
bp at a conserved site, whilst Mo4CL1 was devoid of introns.

The non-conventional dimorphic thermo- and salt-resistant yeast Arxula 
adeninivorans has been developed as a host for heterologous gene expression. For 
assessment of the system two model genes have been selected: the GFP gene 
encoding the intracellular green fluorescent protein, and the HSA gene encoding 
the secreted human serum albumin. The expression system includes two host 
strains, namely A. adeninivorans LS3, which forms budding cells at 30 degrees C 
and mycelia at >42 degrees C, and the strain A. adeninivorans 135, which forms 
mycelia at temperatures as low as 30 degrees C. For expression control the 
constitutive A. adeninivorans-derived TEF1-promoter and S. cerevisiae-derived 
PHO5-terminator were selected. The basic A. adeninivorans 
transformation/expression vector pAL-HPH1 is further equipped with the 
Escherichia coli-derived hph gene conferring hygromycin B resistance and the 25S 
rDNA from A. adeninivorans for rDNA targeting. Transformants were obtained for 
both budding cells and mycelia. In both cell types similar expression levels 
were achieved and the GFP was localised in the cytoplasm while more than 95% of 
the HSA accumulated in the culture medium. In initial fermentation trials on a 
200-ml shake flask scale maximal HSA product levels were observed after 96 h of 
cultivation.

Expression of ecdysteroid receptor and ultraspiracle from Chironomus tentans 
(Insecta, Diptera) in E. coli and purification in a functional state.

Full length clones of ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP) from 
Chironomus tentans were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and purified 
by affinity chromatography. The absence of detergents during the purification 
procedure is essential for retaining receptor function, especially ligand 
binding. Presence of USP is mandatory for ligand binding to EcR, but no other 
cofactors or posttranslational modifications seem to be important, since 
Scatchard plots revealed the same characteristics (two high affinity binding 
sites for Ponasterone A with K(D1)=0.24+/-0.1nM and K(D2)=3.9+/-1.3.nM) as found 
in 0.4 M NaCl extracts of Chironomus cells. Gel mobility shift assays showed 
binding of the heterodimer to PAL and DR5 even after removal of the GST-tag, 
whereas EcR binding to PAL1 is GST-dependent. USP binds preferentially to DR5. 
Addition of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate improves ligand binding only 
slightly. Removal of GST has no effect on (3)H-ponasterone A binding, but alters 
DNA binding characteristics. Calculation of specific binding (5.3+3.0 nmol/mg 
GST EcR) revealed that 47+/-26% of purified receptor protein was able to bind 
ligand. The addition of purified EcR to cell extracts of hormone resistant 
subclones of the epithelial cell line from C. tentans, which have lost their 
ability to bind ligand, restores specific binding of (3)H-ponasterone A.

Cloning and characterization of the gene cluster for palatinose metabolism from 
the phytopathogenic bacterium Erwinia rhapontici.

Erwinia rhapontici is able to convert sucrose into isomaltulose (palatinose, 
6-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-D-fructose) and trehalulose 
(1-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-D-fructose) by the activity of a sucrose isomerase. 
These sucrose isomers cannot be metabolized by plant cells and most other 
organisms and therefore are possibly advantageous for the pathogen. This view is 
supported by the observation that in vitro yeast invertase activity can be 
inhibited by palatinose, thus preventing sucrose consumption. Due to the lack of 
genetic information, the role of sucrose isomers in pathogenicity has not been 
evaluated. Here we describe for the first time the cloning and characterization 
of the palatinose (pal) genes from Erwinia rhapontici. To this end, a 15-kb 
chromosomal DNA fragment containing nine complete open reading frames (ORFs) was 
cloned. The pal gene products of Erwinia rhapontici were shown to be homologous 
to proteins involved in uptake and metabolism of various sugars from other 
microorganisms. The palE, palF, palG, palH, palK, palQ, and palZ genes were 
oriented divergently with respect to the palR and palI genes, and sequence 
analysis suggested that the first set of genes constitutes an operon. Northern 
blot analysis of RNA extracted from bacteria grown under various conditions 
implies that the expression of the palI gene and the palEFGHKQZ genes is 
oppositely regulated at the transcriptional level. Genes involved in palatinose 
uptake and metabolism are down regulated by sucrose and activated by palatinose. 
Palatinose activation is inhibited by sucrose. Functional expression of palI and 
palQ in Escherichia coli revealed sucrose isomerase and palatinase activity, 
respectively.

The tol-oprL region in Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be involved in pyocin

tolQRA and oprL genes as well as the incomplete sequences of tolB and orf2 have 
been previously reported. In addition, the sequence of a P. aeruginosa

this study, we cloned the remainder of the P. aeruginosa tol-oprL gene cluster 
and determined its nucleotide sequence. This cluster was found to consist of 
seven genes in the order orf1 tolQ tolR tolA tolB oprL orf2. Transcriptional 
analysis of this gene cluster was performed by detecting the presence of mRNAs

fused to each of the seven genes contained in the tol-oprL locus. The results 
show that there are three major transcriptional units or operons in this region, 
orf1-tolQRA, tolB, and oprL-orf2, in contrast to the E. coli tol-pal region, 
where there are only two operons, orf1-tolQRA and tolB-pal-orf2. Analysis of 
gene expression indicated that the tol-oprL genes of P. aeruginosa are both iron 
and growth phase modulated. The first operon, orf1-tolQRA, is iron regulated 
throughout growth, but iron-regulated expression of tolB and oprL fusions occurs 
only in late log phase. The expression of the three operons was significantly 
less repressed by iron in fur mutants than in the wild-type strain, suggesting 
the involvement of Fur in the iron regulation of all three operons. RegA is a 
positive yet nonessential regulator of tol-oprL expression.

Structural and catalytic properties of the four phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 
isoenzymes from parsley (Petroselinum crispum Nym.).

Near-full-length cDNAs for the four phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) isoenzymes 
in parsley (Petroselium crispum Nym.) were cloned and the complete amino acid 
sequences deduced. Fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase were expressed 
in Escherichia coli, purified and cleaved. All of the resulting phenylalanine 
ammonia-lyase proteins, as well as the fusion proteins, were catalytically 
active. The turnover number of one selected isoenzyme, PAL-1, was estimated to 
be around 22 s-1 for each active site. In contrast to a certain degree of 
differential expression in various parts of parsley plants, the four 
phenylalanine ammonia-lyase isoenzymes exhibited very similar apparent Km values 
for L-phenylalanine (15-24.5 microM) as well as identical temperature (58 
degrees C) and pH (8.5) optima. All of them were competitively inhibited by 
(E)-cinnamate with similar efficiency (Ki values: 9.1-21.5 microM), lacked 
cooperative behaviour, and accepted L-tyrosine as a substrate with low affinity 
(Km values: 2.6-7.8 mM). These results suggest that the occurrence of multiple 
gene copies has a function other than encoding isoenzymes with different enzyme 
kinetic properties.

Cloning, genetic analysis, and nucleotide sequence of a determinant coding for a 
19-kilodalton peptidoglycan-associated protein (Ppl) of Legionella pneumophila.

A genomic library of Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires 
disease in humans, was constructed in Escherichia coli K-12, and the recombinant 
clones were screened by immuno-colony blots with an antiserum raised against 
heat-killed L. pneumophila. Twenty-three clones coding for a Legionella-specific 
protein of 19 kDa were isolated. The 19-kDa protein, which represents an outer 
membrane protein, was found to be associated with the peptidoglycan layer both 
in L. pneumophila and in the recombinant E. coli clones. This was shown by 
electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis of bacterial cell membrane 
fractions with a monospecific polyclonal 19-kDa protein-specific antiserum. The 
protein was termed peptidoglycan-associated protein of L. pneumophila (Ppl). The 
corresponding genetic determinant, ppl, was subcloned on a 1.8-kb ClaI fragment. 
DNA sequence studies revealed that two open reading frames, pplA and pplB, 
coding for putative proteins of 18.9 and 16.8 kDa, respectively, were located on 
the ClaI fragment. Exonuclease III digestion studies confirmed that pplA is the 
gene coding for the peptidoglycan-associated 19-kDa protein of L. pneumophila. 
The amino acid sequence of PplA exhibits a high degree of homology to the 
sequences of the Pal lipoproteins of E. coli K-12 and Haemophilus influenzae.

Properties of an alpha-galactosidase, and structure of its gene galA, within an 
alpha-and beta-galactoside utilization gene cluster of the hyperthermophilic 
bacterium Thermotoga maritima.

Thermotoga maritima represents one of the few hyperthermophilic bacteria 
currently known. The chromosomal alpha-galactosidase gene of T. maritima strain 
MSB8 has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The gene, 
designated galA, has coding capacity for a 552 residue polypeptide with a 
calculated molecular mass of 63,653 Da. GalA was found to be flanked by other 
genes probably involved in galactoside breakdown and utilization. The previously 
sequenced beta-galactosidase gene, lacZ, is localized immediately upstream of 
galA while two open reading frames that putatively encode enzymes of galactose 
catabolism, i.e. galactose-1-phosphate uridylytransferase (galT) and 
galactokinase (galK), were found downstream of galA. The identified genes are 
extremely close together or even overlap and have the same orientation, so they 
could all be part of one galactoside utilization operon of T. maritima MSB8. 
GalA displayed low-level amino acid sequence similarity with alpha-galactoside 
of glycosyl hydrolase family 36. However, GalA is smaller than the other members 
of this enzyme family. The galA gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the 
recombinant alpha-galactosidase was purified and characterized. The molecular 
mass of the recombinant enzyme was estimated at about 62 kDa by denaturting gel 
electrophoresis. Maximal hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate 
p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside was measured at pH 5.0-5.5 and 90-95 
degrees C (5 min assay). Divalent cations were not required for activity. The 
enzyme released galactose from raffinose, melibiose and the synthetic substrates 
p-nitrophenyl-and omicron-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside. The T. maritima 
alpha-galactosidase thus was highly specific for the galactose moiety and the 
alpha-anomeric configuration of the glycosidic linkage. Its extreme thermal 
stability (t 1/2 = 6.5 h at 85 degrees C) makes this enzyme an interesting 
candidate for biotechnological applications.

The mannitol utilization genes of Pseudomonas fluorescens are regulated by an 
activator: cloning, nucleotide sequence and expression of the mtlR gene.

A plasmid with the galK gene under control of the promoter of the mannitol 
utilization genes (mtl) from Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 50106 was constructed 
to isolate the mtl regulatory gene. An Escherichia coli galK- mtl- strain with 
this plasmid was used to screen a genomic library of P. fluorescens for the 
presence of the regulatory gene by plating on McConkey agar plates supplemented 
with galactose and mannitol. Clones carrying the regulatory gene were isolated 
and by complemention assays, deletion analysis and DNA sequencing an open 
reading frame (mtlR) of 906nt identified encoding the regulator. The deduced 
protein MtlR with a calculated molecular mass of 34.7kDa showed a low overall 
similarity to several other regulatory proteins of the XylS/AraC family. When 
mtlR was cloned and expressed in E. coli, the protein was produced as inclusion 
bodies. Complete denaturation followed by subsequent slow refolding led to low 
amounts of active protein. The activity was shown in gel mobility shift assays 
by binding of MtlR to a DNA fragment containing the promoter/operator region of 
the P. fluorescens mtl genes.

The Bacillus subtilis galE gene is essential in the presence of glucose and 
galactose.

Bacillus subtilis is unable to grow by consuming galactose because it is unable 
to transport it into the cell. The transcription of galE is not influenced by 
galactose but is repressed by glucose. Galactose is toxic for galE-negative 
bacteria because it results in elevated levels of metabolic intermediates. These 
negative effects are reduced in galK and galT mutants. Glucose is also toxic for 
galE-negative strains.

Genetics of galactose metabolism of Erwinia amylovora and its influence on 
polysaccharide synthesis and virulence of the fire blight pathogen.

Galactose metabolism mutants of Erwinia amylovora were created by transposon 
insertions and characterized for their growth properties and interaction with 
plant tissue. The nucleotide sequence of the galE gene was determined. The gene, 
which encodes UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, shows homology to the galE genes of 
Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Rhizobium meliloti, and other 
gram-negative bacteria. Cloned DNA with the galE and with the galT and galK 
genes did not share borders, as judged by the lack of common fragments in 
hybridization with chromosomal DNA. These genes are thus located separately on 
the bacterial chromosome. In contrast to the gal operon of E. coli, the galE 
gene of E. amylovora is constitutively expressed, independently of the presence 
of galactose in the medium. The function of the galE gene but not of the galT or 
galK gene is required for bacterial virulence on pear fruits and seedlings. In 
the absence of galactose, the galE mutant was deficient in amylovoran synthesis. 
Subsequently, the galE mutant cells elicited host defense reactions, and they 
were not stained by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled lectin, which 
efficiently binds to amylovoran capsules of E. amylovora. The mutation affected 
the side chains of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, but an intact O antigen was not 
required for virulence. This was shown with another mutant, which could be 
complemented for virulence but not for side chain synthesis of 
lipopolysaccharide.

Expression of the laminin-A chain is down-regulated by a non-canonical 
polyadenylation signal.

It is well accepted that 3' untranslated regions (UTR) are an essential part of 
mRNA. However, little is known in detail about the contribution of different 
regions of 3' UTR on synthesis, stability and translatability of their mRNA. In 
addition to the highly conserved hexanucleotide AAUAAA, some consensus sequences 
for 3'-end processing and polyadenylation have been characterized, but most of 
this work has been done with viral mRNA or beta-globin mRNA. We have studied the 
influence of the 3' UTR of the mRNA for the three chains A, B1, B2 of laminin on 
the expression of a reporter gene (galK). Laminin is a large glycoprotein of 
basement membranes and all three polypeptide chains are needed in equal amounts 
for a functional molecule. The three 3' UTR of the laminin mRNA differ widely 
with respect to length, number of polyadenylation signals and other consensus 
sequences. Nevertheless, all three 3' UTR reduce the expression of the reporter 
gene at least three-fold, when the corresponding cDNA sequences are inserted 
downstream of the reporter gene instead of the 3' UTR of simian virus 40 early 
genes. The 3' UTR of laminin-A mRNA contains the non-canonical polyadenylation 
signal AUUAAA which seems to be responsible for the limiting amounts of 
laminin-A mRNA and protein compared to those for laminin B1 and B2 [Speth and 
Oberbäumer (1993) Exp. Cell Res. 204, 302-310]. Mutation of the laminin-A 
polyadenylation signal to the canonical form AAUAAA increases expression by a 
factor of 2.5.

Improvement of recombinant gene expression in Escherichia coli for 
glucose-controlled continuous and fed-batch cultures.

Republic of Germany.

Escherichia coli TG1 (pHRW500) permanently expressed the human interferon alpha 
1 gene (ifn alpha 1) directed by the tryptophan promoter (trpP.O) during 
continuous and fed-batch cultivation with a limited supply of glucose. The 
expression of ifn alpha 1 could be improved after insertion of the catabolite 
activator region (cap) upstream to trpP.O during cultivation of the modified E. 
coli TG1(pHRW500cap) in glucose-controlled continuous and fed-batch cultures. 
The cap-mediated stimulatory effect on the expression of cap-trpP.O-ifn alpha 1 
increased with decreasing dilution rate. These results are in line with the 
increase in the level of cAMP with declining dilution rate and the well-known 
positive effects of cAMP-catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) at the 
transcriptional level. In addition, expression of the galactokinase gene 
(trpP.O-galK) in E. coli TG1(pDR720) could be improved in the same way with 
cap-trpP.O-galK in E. coli TG1(pDR720cap). Determinations of plasmid copy 
numbers, cellular amounts of galactokinase-mRNA, activity of galactokinase 
(AGalK) and the concentration of galactokinase at various dilution rates (D) 
strengthen the conclusion that the increase in AGalK with decreasing D was 
indeed due to the cap-mediated enhancement of transcription of the galK gene. We 
suggest that expression of other recombinant genes directed by various promoters 
that allow permanent transcription during growth with limited glucose supply in 
chemostat and fed-batch fermentors can be improved by appropriate insertion of 
the cap region.

We have constructed a genetic assay which selects positively for a functional 
interaction between Tet repressor and its cognate operator in Escherichia coli. 
In this strain Tet repressor blocks expression of lacI and lacZ. This leads to 
derepression of a lacPO controlled galK gene. The strain can be selected by 
growth on galactose as the sole carbon source and screened for the 
beta-galactosidase phenotype. These features allow the identification of one 
candidate among 10(8) false clones on a single plate. The assay was applied to 
select mutants with a ts DNA binding phenotype and to screen oligonucleotide 
generated Tet repressor mutants. Analysis of these mutations revealed that they 
affect DNA and inducer binding and possibly the dimerization domains. These 
mutations are located at residues 21, 48, 49, 89 and at the C terminus of the 
protein (193), respectively.

Republic of Germany.

In the active orientation the DnaA protein/dnaA box complex blocks transcribing 
RNA polymerase. The extent of transcription termination at different dnaA boxes 
was used to determine in vivo their various affinities to the DnaA protein. The 
rate of transcription distal to the respective dnaA box was monitored by the 
expression of the reporter gene galK. The dnaA boxes (5'-TTATACACA and 
5'-TTATCCAAA), present in oriC, showed the strongest binding affinity. The dnaA 
box 5'-TTTTCCACA was mutated at eight positions such that the boxes differed 
from the consensus sequence, 5'-TT(A/T)T(A/C)CA(A/C)A, defined so far. Based on 
the different properties of the dnaA boxes, a new consensus sequence was 
derived: 5'-(T/C)(T/C)(A/T/C)T(A/C)C(A/G)(A/C/T(A/C).

Quantitative analysis of Tn10 Tet repressor binding to a complete set of tet

A saturating oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of both tet operators in the 
tet regulatory sequence was performed yielding mutants with four identical base 
pair exchanges at equivalent positions in the four tet operator half sides. The 
mutants were cloned between bipolar lacZ and galK indicator genes on a multicopy 
plasmid allowing the quantitative analysis of their effects in vivo. In the 
absence of Tet repressor the mutations lead to considerably different expression 
levels of both genes. They are discussed with respect to the promoter consensus 
sequences. In particular, the -10 region of the in vivo active tetPR2 promoter 
is unambiguously defined by these results. In the presence of Tet repressor most 
of the mutants exhibit a lower affinity for that protein as determined 
quantitatively by their reduced expression levels. In general, tet operator 
recognition is most strongly affected by alterations of base pairs near the 
center of the palindromic sequence. The most important position is the third 
base pair, followed by base pairs two, four, five and six, the latter showing 
similar effects as base pair one. At each position, the four possible base pairs 
show different affinities for Tet repressor. They are discussed according to 
their exposure of H-bond donors and -acceptors in the major and minor grooves of 
the B-DNA. The results are in agreement with major groove contacts at positions 
two, three and five. At position four a low potential correlation of 
efficiencies with the H-bonding in the minor groove is found, while mutations at 
position six seem to influence repressor binding by other mechanisms.

Termination of the Escherichia coli asnC transcript. The DnaA protein/dnaA box 
complex blocks transcribing RNA polymerase.

Genes clockwise of oriC, the Escherichia coli replication origin 
(oriC-mioC-asnC), show anticlockwise transcription. The intergenic region 
between mioC and asnC contains both a terminator and a consensus 
DnaA-protein-binding site (dnaA box). We analysed termination in this region 
using galK expression to monitor for transcription. About 50% of the asnC 
transcripts were not terminated, and about 25% terminated at the asnC 
terminator. We found that the DnaA protein/dnaA box complex acts as a terminator 
of transcription for about 25% of the transcripts. Its efficiency could be 
increased by raising the level of DnaA protein, or it could be inactivated by 
deletion in the dnaA box or by thermal denaturation of the DnaA protein.

The Thermus thermophilus TH125 alpha-galactosidase gene, agaT, and flanking 
sequences were cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced as well as flanking 
sequences of the previously cloned agaT from Thermus brockianus ITI360. 
Different structures of putative alpha-galactosidase operons in the two Thermus 
strains were revealed. Downstream of and overlapping with the 
alpha-galactosidase genes of both strains, a gene was identified that is similar 
to the galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase gene (galT) of E. coli and 
Streptomyces lividans. Upstream of the agaT of T. brockianus ITI360, four open 
reading frames were observed. The deduced translation products displayed 
similarity to components of bacterial binding protein-dependent transport 
systems and a beta-galactosidase. No galactoside utilization genes were 
identified upstream of agaT in T. thermophilus TH125. The inactivation of the 
alpha-galactosidase genes of both strains by insertional mutagenesis led to an 
inability to use melibiose or galactose as a single carbohydrate source. An 
attempt was made to isolate a gene encoding the enzyme responsible for 
para-nitrophenyl-(pNP-) beta-galactoside hydrolyzing activity in T. thermophilus 
TH125. A gene designated bglT was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The 
inactivation of the bglT gene led to 55% reduction of the pNP-beta-galactoside 
hydrolyzing activity in the mutant strain in comparison to the wild type.

UDP-xylose and UDP-galactose synthesis in Trichomonas vaginalis.

The presence of xylose and galactose residues in the structure of trichomonad 
lipoglycans was indicated by previous studies and the modification of any 
glycoconjugate with either monosaccharide requires the respective presence of 
the nucleotide sugars, UDP-xylose and UDP-galactose. Biosynthesis of UDP-xylose 
de novo is mediated by UDP-xylose synthase (UXS; UDP-glucuronic acid 
decarboxylase), which converts UDP-glucuronic acid to UDP-xylose, whereas 
UDP-galactose can be generated from UDP-glucose by UDP-galactose epimerases 
(GalE). Trichomonas vaginalis cDNAs, encoding proteins with homology to these 
enzymes from other eukaryotes, were isolated. The recombinant T. vaginalis 
UDP-xylose synthase and UDP-galactose epimerase were expressed in Escherichia 
coli and tested via high pressure liquid chromatography to demonstrate their 
enzymatic activities. Thereby, in this first report on enzymes involved in 
glycoconjugate biosynthesis in this organism, we demonstrate the existence of 
xylose and galactose synthesising pathways in T. vaginalis.

isolates with intact O antigen but altered core oligosaccharide which were also 
affected in galactose catabolism; this strains have mutations in the galU gene. 
We inactivated another gal gene, galE, and the mutant was also found to be 
defective in the catabolism of exogenous galactose but synthesized an apparently 
normal lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both gal mutants as well as a rough LPS (R-LPS) 
mutant were investigated for the ability to colonize the mouse small intestine. 
The galU and R-LPS mutants, but not the galE mutant, were defective in 
colonization, a phenotype also associated with O-antigen-negative mutants. By 
investigating several parameters in vitro, we could show that galU and R-LPS 
mutants were more sensitive to short-chain organic acids, cationic antimicrobial 
peptides, the complement system, and bile salts as well as other hydrophobic 
agents, indicating that their outer membrane no longer provides an effective 
barrier function. O-antigen-negative strains were found to be sensitive to 
complement and cationic peptides, but they displayed significant resistance to 
bile salts and short-chain organic acids. Furthermore, we found that galU and 
galE are essential for the formation of a biofilm in a spontaneous 
phage-resistant rugose variant, suggesting that the synthesis of UDP-galactose 
via UDP-glucose is necessary for biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide. In 
addition, we provide evidence that the production of exopolysaccharide limits 
the access of phage K139 to its receptor, the O antigen. In conclusion, our 
results indicate involvement of galU in V. cholerae virulence, correlated with 
the observed change in LPS structure, and a role for galU and galE in 
environmental survival of V. cholerae.

The Bacillus subtilis galE gene is essential in the presence of glucose and 
galactose.

Bacillus subtilis is unable to grow by consuming galactose because it is unable 
to transport it into the cell. The transcription of galE is not influenced by 
galactose but is repressed by glucose. Galactose is toxic for galE-negative 
bacteria because it results in elevated levels of metabolic intermediates. These 
negative effects are reduced in galK and galT mutants. Glucose is also toxic for 
galE-negative strains.

Gonococcal rfaF mutants express Rd2 chemotype LPS and do not enter epithelial 
host cells.

We have investigated the function of the Isi-1 gene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae 
previously implicated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inner-core biosynthesis 
(Petricoin et al., 1991). Disruption of the gene in gonococcal strain MS11 
resulted in the production of LPS that migrated faster than that from an 
isogenic galE mutant, typical for a mutation that influences the inner-core 
region. Complementation of a panel of Salmonella typhimurium mutants with 
defined defects in rfa loci demonstrated conclusively that the Isi-1 gene of 
MS11 is functionally homologous to the rfaF gene, which encodes 
heptosyltransferase II in both E. coli and S. typhimurium. Comparison of deduced 
amino acid sequences of the gonococcal and the Salmonella RfaF demonstrated 70% 
similarity, including 47% identical amino acid residues. Immunochemical analysis 
of the LPS using monoclonal antibodies directed against chemically defined 
inner-core glycoconjugates revealed that the gonococcal and Salmonella 
Rd2-chemotypes were antigenically similar, further extending the genetic and 
functional homology. Infection experiments in vitro demonstrated that the Isi-1 
mutant could not invade human Chang epithelial cells despite expression of a 
genetically defined invasion-promoting gonococcal opacity protein. These data 
imply that the LPS phenotype is a critical factor for gonococcal invasiveness.

The identification of cryptic rhamnose biosynthesis genes in Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae and their relationship to lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae synthesizes a rough lipopolysaccharide that does not 
contain any of the repetitive units characteristic of the smooth 
lipopolysaccharide of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Three gonococcal 
homologs of Salmonella serovar typhimurium genes involved in the synthesis of 
the rhamnose component of the repetitive subunits have been isolated. Gonococcal 
homologs for rfbB, rfbA, and rfbD were found downstream of the galE gene in a 
region of the chromosome which shows overall homology with the meningococcal 
capsule gene complex region D. Sequence alignment demonstrated that the 
gonococcal gene products have 69, 65, and 54% amino acid identity with the 
Salmonella proteins RfbB, RfbA, and RfbD. The gonococcal RfbB and RfbA amino 
acid sequences share even more identical residues (73 and 65%, respectively) 
with the amino acid sequences derived from Escherichia coli genes o355 and o292, 
respectively. These genes are clustered with the genes involved in the 
biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen, and o355 is listed in the 
GenBank and Swiss Protein data banks as rffE (encoding UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase). 
However, complementation studies demonstrated that o355 does not encode the 
enzyme UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase. Gonococcal strains constructed with null 
mutations in the rfbBAD genes were unchanged in lipopolysaccharide phenotype and 
in the synthesis of gonococcal carbohydrate-containing C antigen. We were unable 
to detect any changes in gonococcal phenotype with respect to lipopolysaccharide 
sialylation, monoclonal-antibody binding, serum sensitivity, or interaction with 
eukaryotic cells in vitro. We conclude that the absence of a homolog for rfbC 
precludes the existence of a functional dTDP-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway in 
the gonococcal strains examined and that these genes are only maintained in N. 
gonorrhoeae either because of the presence of the galE gene or because of 
another as yet unrecognized function.

Contribution of genes from the capsule gene complex (cps) to lipooligosaccharide 
biosynthesis and serum resistance in Neisseria meningitidis.

Within the capsule gene complex (cps) of Neisseria meningitidis B a 5.5 kb DNA 
fragment encodes proteins with strong homologies to enzymes of the 
lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway of Salmonella typhimurium and 
Escherichia coli, GalE, RfbB, RfbC and RfbD. A meningococcal galE mutant 
expressed a truncated lipooligosaccharide (LOS), which terminated at the glucose 
residue between inner and outer core, and a second galE gene present outside the 
cps cluster was found to be transcriptionally and functionally inactive and, 
thus, unable to complement this defect. Because of the defect in the outer core, 
the LOS of the galE-defective meningococcal mutant was not sialylated. In 
contrast, carbohydrate analysis of the LOS of an rfb-defective meningococcal 
mutant revealed no difference from the LOS of the wild-type strain, suggesting 
that the rfb genes are inactive. This was supported by Northern blot analysis, 
which showed that expression of the rfb gene products was transcriptionally 
regulated. The inability of the meningococcal galE mutant, which cannot 
sialylate the LOS, allowed us to investigate the significance of LOS sialylation 
in relation to the presence of the polysialic acid capsule. Sialylated LOS, but 
not the polysialic acid capsule, is necessary to confer complete serum 
resistance on the meningococcus by inhibition of the alternative complement 
pathway.

Genetics of galactose metabolism of Erwinia amylovora and its influence on 
polysaccharide synthesis and virulence of the fire blight pathogen.

Galactose metabolism mutants of Erwinia amylovora were created by transposon 
insertions and characterized for their growth properties and interaction with 
plant tissue. The nucleotide sequence of the galE gene was determined. The gene, 
which encodes UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, shows homology to the galE genes of 
Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Rhizobium meliloti, and other 
gram-negative bacteria. Cloned DNA with the galE and with the galT and galK 
genes did not share borders, as judged by the lack of common fragments in 
hybridization with chromosomal DNA. These genes are thus located separately on 
the bacterial chromosome. In contrast to the gal operon of E. coli, the galE 
gene of E. amylovora is constitutively expressed, independently of the presence 
of galactose in the medium. The function of the galE gene but not of the galT or 
galK gene is required for bacterial virulence on pear fruits and seedlings. In 
the absence of galactose, the galE mutant was deficient in amylovoran synthesis. 
Subsequently, the galE mutant cells elicited host defense reactions, and they 
were not stained by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled lectin, which 
efficiently binds to amylovoran capsules of E. amylovora. The mutation affected 
the side chains of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, but an intact O antigen was not 
required for virulence. This was shown with another mutant, which could be 
complemented for virulence but not for side chain synthesis of 
lipopolysaccharide.

The role of galE in the biosynthesis and function of gonococcal 
lipopolysaccharide.

Germany.

Lipopolysaccharide is an essential component of the outer membrane of 
Gram-negative bacteria and an important virulence factor of many pathogens, such 
as Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We have cloned the gonococcal galE gene which was 
found to be located in the gonococcal homologue of the meningococcal capsule 
gene complex region D. Sequence alignment indicated extensive homology with the 
Escherichia coli and Salmonella GalE proteins. Mutants with insertions in the 
galE gene were used as a tool to characterize the structure and function of 
gonococcal lipopolysaccharide. They displayed deep rough phenotypes, and 
chemical analysis confirmed the loss of galactose from the mutant 
lipopolysaccharide. Functional analysis indicated that the terminal 
oligosaccharides contain galactose and that these are lost in galE mutants. The 
importance of these oligosaccharides in gonococcal biology is clear from the 
fact that they contain the epitopes that are the targets for killing by normal 
human serum, and the acceptor site for sialic acid, which acts to protect the 
gonococcus from this killing. Furthermore, infection experiments in vitro 
indicate that the galE mutants exhibit unaltered intergonococcal adhesion as 
well as adhesion to, and invasion of, epithelial cells.

The Rhizobium meliloti exoZl exoB fragment of megaplasmid 2: ExoB functions as a

leguminosarum biovar viciae strain TOM.

A 2.6 kb ClaI-BamHI DNA fragment of megaplasmid 2 of Rhizobium meliloti 2011 was 
found to carry genes involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis and infection of 
alfalfa nodules. The analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this DNA fragment 
revealed the existence of two open reading frames (ORFs) running in opposite 
directions. Plasmid integration mutagenesis showed that these ORFs are organized 
as two monocistronic transcription units. One of the ORFs represents a new exo 
gene designated exoZ, which is involved in, but not essential for, the 
production of acidic exopolysaccharide. However, exoZ is not necessary for 
nodule formation with alfalfa. The ExoZ protein was found to show homology 
(23.3%) to the NodX protein of the R. leguminosarum biovar viciae strain TOM, 
known to be essential for nodulating the primitive Afghanistan pea. The second 
identified ORF corresponds to the exoB locus. The deduced amino acid sequence of 
the ExoB protein is homologous (39.6%) to that of the Escherichia coli GalE 
protein. In R. meliloti, exoB codes for a UDP-glucose 4-epimerase. A deficiency 
in the activity of this enzyme fully accounts for all the multiple carbohydrate 
defects that have been observed in exoB mutants.

The interaction of the recognition helix of lac repressor with lac operator.

We have constructed a system which allows systematic testing of 
repressor--operator interactions. The system consists of two plasmids. One of 
them carries a lac operon in which lac operator has been replaced by a unique 
restriction site into which synthetic operators can be cloned. The other plasmid 
carries the gene coding for the repressor, in our case a semisynthetic lacI gene 
of which parts can be exchanged in a cassette-like manner. A galE host allows us 
to select for mutants which express repressors with altered specificities. Here 
we report the change of specificity in the lac system by changing residues 1 and 
2 of the recognition helix of lac repressor. The specificity changes are brought 
about cooperatively by the change of both residues. Exchanges of just one 
residue broaden the specificity. Our results hint that the recognition helix of 
lac repressor may possibly have the opposite orientation to those in Lambda cro 
protein or 434 CI repressor.

There is increasing experimental evidence that ADP-ribosylation of host proteins 
is an important means to regulate gene expression of bacteriophage T4. 
Surprisingly, this phage codes for three different ADP-ribosyltransferases, gene 
products Alt, ModA, and ModB, modifying partially overlapping sets of host 
proteins. While gene product Alt already has been isolated as a recombinant 
protein and its action on host RNA polymerases and transcription regulation have 
been studied, the nucleotide sequences of the two mod genes was published only 
recently. Their mode of action in the course of the infection cycle and the 
consequences of the ADP-ribosylations catalyzed by these enzymes remain to be 
investigated. Here we describe the cloning of the genes, the overexpression, 
purification, and partial characterization of ADP-ribosyltransferases ModA and 
ModB. Both proteins seem to act independently, and the ADP-ribosyl moieties are 
transferred to different sets of host proteins. While gene product ModA, 
similarly to the Alt protein, acts also on the alpha-subunit of host RNA 
polymerase, the ModB activity serves another set of proteins, one of which was 
identified as the S1 protein associated with the 30S subunit of the E. coli 
ribosomes.

Activity of the molybdopterin-containing xanthine dehydrogenase of Rhodobacter 
capsulatus can be restored by high molybdenum concentrations in a moeA mutant 
defective in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis.

Mikroorganismen, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.

During the screening for Rhodobacter capsulatus mutants defective in xanthine 
degradation, one Tn5 mutant which was able to grow with xanthine as a sole 
nitrogen source only in the presence of high molybdate concentrations (1 mM), a 
phenotype resembling Escherichia coli mogA mutants, was identified. 
Unexpectedly, the corresponding Tn5 insertion was located within the moeA gene. 
Partial DNA sequence analysis and interposon mutagenesis of regions flanking R. 
capsulatus moeA revealed that no further genes essential for molybdopterin 
biosynthesis are located in the vicinity of moeA and revealed that moeA forms a 
monocistronic transcriptional unit in R. capsulatus. Amino acid sequence 
alignments of R. capsulatus MoeA (414 amino acids [aa]) with E. coli MogA (195 
aa) showed that MoeA contains an internal domain homologous to MogA, suggesting 
similar functions of these proteins in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum 
cofactor. Interposon mutants defective in moeA did not exhibit dimethyl 
sulfoxide reductase or nitrate reductase activity, which both require the 
molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) cofactor, even after addition of 1 mM 
molybdate to the medium. In contrast, the activity of xanthine dehydrogenase, 
which binds the molybdopterin (MPT) cofactor, was restored to wild-type levels 
after the addition of 1 mM molybdate to the growth medium. Analysis of 
fluorescent derivatives of the molybdenum cofactor of purified xanthine 
dehydrogenase isolated from moeA and modA mutant strains, respectively, revealed 
that MPT is inserted into the enzyme only after molybdenum chelation, and both 
metal chelation and Mo-MPT insertion can occur only under high molybdate 
concentrations in the absence of MoeA. These data support a model for the 
biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor in which the biosynthesis of MPT and MGD 
are split at a stage when the molybdenum atom is added to MPT.

A gene cluster consisting of homologs to Escherichia coli moaA, moeA, moaC and 
moaE, which encode enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of molybdopterin 
cofactor (MoCo), and to modA, modB and modC, which encode a high-affinity 
molybdate transporter, were identified on pAO1 of Arthrobacter nicotinovorans 
near genes of molybdopterin-dependent enzymes involved in nicotine degradation. 
This gene arrangement suggests a coordinated expression of the MoCo-dependent 
and the MoCo-biosynthesis genes and shows that catabolic plasmids may carry the 
transport and biosynthetic machinery for the synthesis of the cofactors needed 
for the functioning of the enzymes they encode. pAO1 MoeA functionally 
complemented E. coli moeA mutants. The overexpressed and purified protein, of 
molecular mass 44,500 Da, associated into high-molecular-mass complexes and 
spontaneously formed gels at concentrations above 1 mg/ml. Transmission electron 
microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that MoeA forms fibrilar 
structures. In the presence of Mg2+ MoeA exhibited ATPase activity (0.020 pmol 
ATP x pmol protein(-1) x min(-1)). ATP, ADP or AMP induced the disassembly of 
the MoeA fibers into aggregates. pAO1 MoeA shows 39% identity to the C-terminal 
domain of the rat neuroprotein gephyrin. Like gephyrin it binds to neurotubulin, 
but binds with preference to tubulin dimers.

Molecular analysis of the molybdate uptake operon, modABCD, of Escherichia coli 
and modR, a regulatory gene.

Bielefeld, Germany.

The nucleotide sequence of a 6.8-kb chromosomal subfragment of plasmid pHW100 
complementing an Escherichia coli modC (chlD) mutant has been determined. This 
DNA region encodes the genes of a high-affinity uptake system for molybdate 
arranged in an operon with the genes modABCD. Since the modA product has a 
signal peptide at the N-terminus it probably is the periplasmic binding-protein 
for molybdate. The products of modB (chlJ) and modC (chlD) have been described 
earlier as the inner membrane protein and the ATP-binding protein of the 
molybdate transport system, respectively. At present, there is no information on 
possible functions of the fourth gene of the operon, modD. Upstream of the mod 
operon, two other gene loci, termed modR and an open reading frame ORF6 could be 
identified. ModR shares homology with a molybdenum-pterin binding protein of 
Clostridium pasteurianum. ORF6 has extensive homology to ModC and other 
nucleotide-binding proteins of E. coli. Insertional inactivation of modR and 
ORF6 using a gentamicin resistance gene cartridge has no effect on molybdoenzyme 
activities, indicating that none of the two gene products is essential for 
molybdate uptake or molybdenum cofactor synthesis. However, by using a plasmid 
carrying a modA-lacZ gene fusion we observed that inactivation of modR releases 
repression of the mod operon independent of the molybdate concentration in the 
medium. This indicates that modR is a component of the mod operon regulation or 
the repressor itself.

The alternative, heterometal-free nitrogenase of Rhodobacter capsulatus is 
repressed by traces of molybdenum in the medium. Strains carrying mutations 
located downstream of nifB copy II were able to express the alternative 
nitrogenase even in the presence of high molybdate concentrations. DNA sequence 
analysis of a 5.5-kb fragment of this region revealed six open reading frames, 
designated modABCD, mopA, and mopB. The gene products of modB and modC are 
homologous to ChlJ and ChlD of Escherichia coli and represent an integral 
membrane protein and an ATP-binding protein typical of high-affinity transport 
systems, respectively. ModA and ModD exhibited no homology to known proteins, 
but a leader peptide characteristic of proteins cleaved during export to the 
periplasm is present in ModA, indicating that ModA might be a periplasmic 
molybdate-binding protein. The MopA and MopB proteins showed a high degree of 
amino acid sequence homology to each other. Both proteins contained a tandem 
repeat of a domain encompassing 70 amino acid residues, which had significant 
sequence similarity to low-molecular-weight molybdenum-pterin-binding proteins 
from Clostridium pasteurianum. Compared with that for the parental nifHDK 
deletion strain, the molybdenum concentrations necessary to repress the 
alternative nitrogenase were increased 4-fold in a modD mutant and 500-fold in 
modA, modB, and modC mutants. No significant inhibition of the heterometal-free 
nitrogenase by molybdate was observed for mopA mopB double mutants. The uptake 
of molybdenum by mod and mop mutants was estimated by measuring the activity of 
the conventional molybdenum-containing nitrogenase. Molybdenum transport was not 
affected in a mopA mopB double mutant, whereas strains carrying lesions in the 
binding-protein-dependent transport system were impaired in molybdenum uptake.

A gene cluster consisting of homologs to Escherichia coli moaA, moeA, moaC and 
moaE, which encode enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of molybdopterin 
cofactor (MoCo), and to modA, modB and modC, which encode a high-affinity 
molybdate transporter, were identified on pAO1 of Arthrobacter nicotinovorans 
near genes of molybdopterin-dependent enzymes involved in nicotine degradation. 
This gene arrangement suggests a coordinated expression of the MoCo-dependent 
and the MoCo-biosynthesis genes and shows that catabolic plasmids may carry the 
transport and biosynthetic machinery for the synthesis of the cofactors needed 
for the functioning of the enzymes they encode. pAO1 MoeA functionally 
complemented E. coli moeA mutants. The overexpressed and purified protein, of 
molecular mass 44,500 Da, associated into high-molecular-mass complexes and 
spontaneously formed gels at concentrations above 1 mg/ml. Transmission electron 
microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that MoeA forms fibrilar 
structures. In the presence of Mg2+ MoeA exhibited ATPase activity (0.020 pmol 
ATP x pmol protein(-1) x min(-1)). ATP, ADP or AMP induced the disassembly of 
the MoeA fibers into aggregates. pAO1 MoeA shows 39% identity to the C-terminal 
domain of the rat neuroprotein gephyrin. Like gephyrin it binds to neurotubulin, 
but binds with preference to tubulin dimers.

Molecular analysis of the molybdate uptake operon, modABCD, of Escherichia coli 
and modR, a regulatory gene.

Bielefeld, Germany.

The nucleotide sequence of a 6.8-kb chromosomal subfragment of plasmid pHW100 
complementing an Escherichia coli modC (chlD) mutant has been determined. This 
DNA region encodes the genes of a high-affinity uptake system for molybdate 
arranged in an operon with the genes modABCD. Since the modA product has a 
signal peptide at the N-terminus it probably is the periplasmic binding-protein 
for molybdate. The products of modB (chlJ) and modC (chlD) have been described 
earlier as the inner membrane protein and the ATP-binding protein of the 
molybdate transport system, respectively. At present, there is no information on 
possible functions of the fourth gene of the operon, modD. Upstream of the mod 
operon, two other gene loci, termed modR and an open reading frame ORF6 could be 
identified. ModR shares homology with a molybdenum-pterin binding protein of 
Clostridium pasteurianum. ORF6 has extensive homology to ModC and other 
nucleotide-binding proteins of E. coli. Insertional inactivation of modR and 
ORF6 using a gentamicin resistance gene cartridge has no effect on molybdoenzyme 
activities, indicating that none of the two gene products is essential for 
molybdate uptake or molybdenum cofactor synthesis. However, by using a plasmid 
carrying a modA-lacZ gene fusion we observed that inactivation of modR releases 
repression of the mod operon independent of the molybdate concentration in the 
medium. This indicates that modR is a component of the mod operon regulation or 
the repressor itself.

The alternative, heterometal-free nitrogenase of Rhodobacter capsulatus is 
repressed by traces of molybdenum in the medium. Strains carrying mutations 
located downstream of nifB copy II were able to express the alternative 
nitrogenase even in the presence of high molybdate concentrations. DNA sequence 
analysis of a 5.5-kb fragment of this region revealed six open reading frames, 
designated modABCD, mopA, and mopB. The gene products of modB and modC are 
homologous to ChlJ and ChlD of Escherichia coli and represent an integral 
membrane protein and an ATP-binding protein typical of high-affinity transport 
systems, respectively. ModA and ModD exhibited no homology to known proteins, 
but a leader peptide characteristic of proteins cleaved during export to the 
periplasm is present in ModA, indicating that ModA might be a periplasmic 
molybdate-binding protein. The MopA and MopB proteins showed a high degree of 
amino acid sequence homology to each other. Both proteins contained a tandem 
repeat of a domain encompassing 70 amino acid residues, which had significant 
sequence similarity to low-molecular-weight molybdenum-pterin-binding proteins 
from Clostridium pasteurianum. Compared with that for the parental nifHDK 
deletion strain, the molybdenum concentrations necessary to repress the 
alternative nitrogenase were increased 4-fold in a modD mutant and 500-fold in 
modA, modB, and modC mutants. No significant inhibition of the heterometal-free 
nitrogenase by molybdate was observed for mopA mopB double mutants. The uptake 
of molybdenum by mod and mop mutants was estimated by measuring the activity of 
the conventional molybdenum-containing nitrogenase. Molybdenum transport was not 
affected in a mopA mopB double mutant, whereas strains carrying lesions in the 
binding-protein-dependent transport system were impaired in molybdenum uptake.

Global role for ClpP-containing proteases in stationary-phase adaptation of 
Escherichia coli.

Strasse 12-16, 14195 Berlin, Germany. weichart@zedat.fu-berlin.de

To elucidate the involvement of proteolysis in the regulation of 
stationary-phase adaptation, the clpA, clpX, and clpP protease mutants of 
Escherichia coli were subjected to proteome analysis during growth and during 
carbon starvation. For most of the growth-phase-regulated proteins detected on 
our gels, the clpA, clpX, or clpP mutant failed to mount the growth-phase 
regulation found in the wild type. For example, in the clpP and clpA mutant 
cultures, the Dps protein, the WrbA protein, and the periplasmic 
lysine-arginine-ornithine binding protein ArgT did not display the induction 
typical for late-stationary-phase wild-type cells. On the other hand, in the 
protease mutants, a number of proteins accumulated to a higher degree than in 
the wild type, especially in late stationary phase. The proteins affected in 
this manner include the LeuA, TrxB, GdhA, GlnA, and MetK proteins and alkyl 
hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC). These proteins may be directly degraded by ClpAP 
or ClpXP, respectively, or their expression could be modulated by a 
protease-dependent mechanism. From our data we conclude that the levels of most 
major growth-phase-regulated proteins in E. coli are at some point controlled by 
the activity of at least one of the ClpP, ClpA, and ClpX proteins. Cultures of 
the strains lacking functional ClpP or ClpX also displayed a more rapid loss of 
viability during extended stationary phase than the wild type. Therefore, 
regulation by proteolysis seems to be more important, especially in resting 
cells, than previously suspected.

The human hemofiltrate peptide HF6478, a putative serine proteinase inhibitor, 
which is part of the precursor protein LEKTI, was cloned, overexpressed, and 
purified. HF6478 contains two disulfide bridges with 1-4, 2-3 connectivity, 
sharing partial homology to Kazal-type domains and other serine proteinase 
inhibitors. It was expressed as thioredoxin (Trx) fusion protein, and disulfide 
formation occurred in the oxidative cytoplasm of Escherichia coli Origami (DE3) 
strain which carries a trxB(-)/gor522(-) double mutation. The soluble fusion 
protein was purified using metal-chelating affinity chromatography. Cleavage of 
the Trx fusion protein with factor Xa and subsequent purification yielded the 
final product in amounts sufficient for structural studies. Characterization of 
recombinant HF6478 was done by amino acid sequencing, mass spectrometry, 
capillary zone electrophoresis, and CD spectroscopy. Taking the blood filtrate 
peptide HF6478 as example, we present a strategy which should facilitate the 
expression of different extracellular proteins in the E. coli cytoplasm.

PerR controls oxidative stress resistance and iron storage proteins and is 
required for virulence in Staphylococcus aureus.

Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, England.

The Staphylococcus aureus genome encodes three ferric uptake regulator (Fur) 
homologues: Fur, PerR, and Zur. To determine the exact role of PerR, we 
inactivated the gene by allelic replacement using a kanamycin cassette, creating 
strain MJH001 (perR). PerR was found to control transcription of the genes 
encoding the oxidative stress resistance proteins catalase (KatA), alkyl 
hydroperoxide reductase (AhpCF), bacterioferritin comigratory protein (Bcp), and 
thioredoxin reductase (TrxB). Furthermore, PerR regulates transcription of the 
genes encoding the iron storage proteins ferritin (Ftn) and the ferritin-like 
Dps homologue, MrgA. Transcription of perR was autoregulated, and PerR repressed 
transcription of the iron homeostasis regulator Fur, which is a positive 
regulator of catalase expression. PerR functions as a manganese-dependent, 
transcriptional repressor of the identified regulon. Elevated iron 
concentrations produced induction of the PerR regulon. PerR may act as a 
peroxide sensor, since addition of external hydrogen peroxide to 8325-4 (wild 
type) resulted in increased transcription of most of the PerR regulon, except 
for fur and perR itself. The PerR-regulated katA gene encodes the sole catalase 
of S. aureus, which is an important starvation survival determinant but is 
surprisingly not required for pathogenicity in a murine skin abscess model of 
infection. In contrast, PerR is not necessary for starvation survival but is 
required for full virulence (P < 0.005) in this model of infection. PerR of S. 
aureus may act as a redox sentinel protein during infection, analogous to the in 
vitro activities of OxyR and PerR of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, 
respectively. However, it differs in its response to the metal balance within 
the cell and has the added capability of regulating iron uptake and storage.

Two closely linked genes encoding thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase in 
Clostridium litorale.

The genes encoding thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase of Clostridium litorale 
were cloned and sequenced. The thioredoxin reductase gene (trxB) encoded a 
protein of 33.9 kDa, and the deduced amino acid sequence showed 44% identity to 
the corresponding protein from Escherichia coli. The gene encoding thioredoxin 
(trxA) was located immediately downstream of trxB. TrxA and TrxB were each 
encoded by two gene copies, both copies presumably located on the chromosome. 
Like other thioredoxins from anaerobic, amino-acid-degrading bacteria 
investigated to date by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, thioredoxin from C. 
litorale exhibited characteristic deviations from the consensus sequence, e.g., 
GCVPC instead of WCGPC at the redox-active center. Using heterologous enzyme 
assays, neither thioredoxin nor thioredoxin reductase were interchangeable with 
the corresponding proteins of the thioredoxin system from E. coli. To elucidate 
the molecular basis of that incompatibility, Gly-31 in C. litorale thioredoxin 
was substituted with Trp (the W in the consensus sequence) by site-directed 
mutagenesis. The mutant protein was expressed in E. coli and was purified to 
homogeneity. Enzyme assays using the G31W thioredoxin revealed that Gly-31 was 
not responsible for the observed incompatibility with the E. coli thioredoxin 
reductase, but it was essential for activity of the thioredoxin system in C. 
litorale.

Glycine reductase of Clostridium litorale. Cloning, sequencing, and molecular

A 2.8-kb HindIII fragment, containing three open reading frames, has been cloned 
and sequenced from Clostridium litorale. The first gene grdA encoded the 
selenocysteine-containing protein PA of the glycine reductase complex, a protein 
of 159 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 16.7 kDa. The second gene 
(grdB) encoded the 47-kDa subunit of the substrate-specific selenoprotein PB 
glycine that is composed of 437 amino acids. The third gene contained the 
5'-region of the gene for thioredoxin reductase, trxB. All gene products shared 
high similarity with the corresponding proteins from Eubacterium 
acidaminophilum. In both genes grdA and grdB, the opal termination codon (TGA) 
was found inframe, indicating the presence of selenocysteine in both 
polypeptides. Northern-blot analysis showed that grdA and grdB are organized as 
one operon. Unlike Escherichia coli, no stable secondary structures of the 
corresponding mRNA were found immediately downstream of the UGA codons to direct 
an insertion of selenocysteine into the grdA and grdB transcripts of C. 
litorale. Instead, a secondary structure was identified in the 3'-untranslated 
region of grdB.

Synthetic competition between cytoplasmic folding and translocation of a soluble 
membrane protein domain.

Uhland K(1), Zander T, Ehrmann M.

(1)Fakultät für Biologie, Universität Konstanz, Germany.

In wild-type strains of Escherichia coli, alkaline phosphatase (AP), either when 
present as a soluble protein or when fused to a membrane protein, is only active 
after translocation to the periplasm. In thioredoxin reductase (trxB) mutants, 
however, cytoplasmically localized AP can form disulphide bonds and can reach an 
active conformation. Once it has folded in the cytoplasm, it can no longer be 
translocated. On the other hand, when AP is fused to periplasmic domains of a 
membrane protein, translocation can be more rapid than folding. Thus, expressing 
hybrids of AP and integral membrane proteins in a trxB mutant generates 
competition between folding of AP in the cytoplasm and its translocation to the 
periplasm. The cellular localization of AP can be monitored in phosphoserine 
phosphatase (serB) mutants causing auxotrophy for L-serine. Cytoplasmically but 
not periplasmically localized AP can compensate for the lack of SerB, leading to 
growth on indicator plates. As expected, when AP was fused to cytoplasmic 
domains of membrane proteins, serB-mediated auxotrophy was abolished. 
Surprisingly, AP fusions to periplasmic domains exhibited a non-uniform response 
pattern. Fusions that translocate AP rapidly did not complement the SerB defect, 
while those that export AP only slowly could do so. The usefulness of these 
strains for studying a variety of aspects related to membrane protein biogenesis 
is discussed.

Components of glycine reductase from Eubacterium acidaminophilum. Cloning,

(1)Institut für Mikrobiologie, Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Germany.

The genes encoding thioredoxin reductase (trxB), thioredoxin (trxA), protein PA 
of glycine reductase (grdA) and the first 23 amino acids of the large subunit of 
protein PC of glycine reductase (grdC) belonging to the reductive deamination 
systems present in Eubacterium acidaminophilum were cloned and sequenced. The 
proteins were products of closely linked genes with 314 codons (thioredoxin 
reductase), 110 codons (thioredoxin), and 158 codons (protein PA). The protein 
previously called 'atypically small lipoamide dehydrogenase' or 'electron 
transferring flavoprotein' could now conclusively be identified as a thioredoxin 
reductase (subunit mass of 34781 Da) by the alignment with the enzyme of 
Escherichia coli showing the same typical order of the corresponding domains. 
The thioredoxin (molecular mass of 11742 Da) deviated considerably from the 
known consensus sequence, even in the most strongly conserved redox-active 
segment WCGPC that was now GCVPC. The selenocysteine of protein PA (molecular 
mass of 16609 Da) was encoded by TGA. The protein was highly similar to those of 
Clostridium purinolyticum and Clostridium sticklandii involved in glycine 
reductase. Thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin of E. acidaminophilum could be 
successfully expressed in E. coli.

EfeUOB (YcdNOB) is a tripartite, acid-induced and CpxAR-regulated, low-pH Fe2+ 
transporter that is cryptic in Escherichia coli K-12 but functional in E. coli 
O157:H7.

Escherichia coli possesses iron transporters specific for either Fe2+ or Fe3+. 
Although Fe2+ is far more soluble than Fe3+, it rapidly oxidizes aerobically at 
pH > or = 7. Thus, FeoAB, the major Fe2+ transporter of E. coli, operates 
anaerobically. However, Fe2+ remains stable aerobically under acidic conditions, 
although a low-pH Fe2+ importer has not been previously identified. Here we show 
that ycdNOB (efeUOB) specifies the first such transporter. efeUOB is repressed 
at high pH by CpxAR, and is Fe2+-Fur repressed. EfeU is homologous to the 
high-affinity iron permease, Ftr1p, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi. 
EfeO is periplasmic with a cupredoxin N-terminal domain; EfeB is also 
periplasmic and is haem peroxidase-like. All three Efe proteins are required for

Escherichia coli possesses iron transporters specific for either Fe2+ or Fe3+. 
Although Fe2+ is far more soluble than Fe3+, it rapidly oxidizes aerobically at 
pH > or = 7. Thus, FeoAB, the major Fe2+ transporter of E. coli, operates 
anaerobically. However, Fe2+ remains stable aerobically under acidic conditions, 
although a low-pH Fe2+ importer has not been previously identified. Here we show 
that ycdNOB (efeUOB) specifies the first such transporter. efeUOB is repressed 
at high pH by CpxAR, and is Fe2+-Fur repressed. EfeU is homologous to the 
high-affinity iron permease, Ftr1p, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi. 
EfeO is periplasmic with a cupredoxin N-terminal domain; EfeB is also 
periplasmic and is haem peroxidase-like. All three Efe proteins are required for 
Efe function. The efeU gene of E. coli K-12 is cryptic due to a frameshift 
mutation - repair of the single-base-pair deletion generates a functional EfeUOB 
system. In contrast, the efeUOB operon of the enterohaemorrhagic strain, 
O157:H7, lacks any frameshift and is functional. A 'wild-type' K-12 strain 
bearing a functional EfeUOB displays a major growth advantage under aerobic, 
low-pH, low-iron conditions when a competing metal is provided. 55Fe transport

A c-di-GMP-Based Switch Controls Local Heterogeneity of Extracellular Matrix 
Synthesis which Is Crucial for Integrity and Morphogenesis of Escherichia coli 
Macrocolony Biofilms.

The extracellular matrix in macrocolony biofilms of Escherichia coli is arranged 
in a complex large-scale architecture, with homogenic matrix production close to 
the surface, whereas zones further below display pronounced local heterogeneity 
of matrix production, which results in distinct three-dimensional architectural 
structures. Combining genetics, cryosectioning and fluorescence microscopy of 
macrocolony biofilms, we demonstrate here in situ that this local matrix 
heterogeneity is generated by a c-di-GMP-dependent molecular switch 
characterized by several nested positive and negative feedback loops. In this 
switch, the trigger phosphodiesterase PdeR is the key component for establishing 
local heterogeneity in the activation of the transcription factor MlrA, which in 
turn activates expression of the major matrix regulator CsgD. Upon its release 
of direct inhibition by PdeR, the second switch component, the diguanylate 
cyclase DgcM, activates MlrA by direct interaction. Antagonistically acting PdeH 
and DgcE provide for a PdeR-sensed c-di-GMP input into this switch and-via their 
spatially differentially controlled expression-generate the long-range vertical 
asymmetry of the matrix architecture. Using flow cytometry, we show 
heterogeneity of CsgD expression to also occur in spatially unstructured 
planktonic cultures, where it is controlled by the same c-di-GMP circuitry as in 
macrocolony biofilms. Quantification by flow cytometry also showed CsgDON 
subpopulations with distinct CsgD expression levels and revealed an additional 
fine-tuning feedback within the PdeR/DgcM-mediated switch that depends on 
c-di-GMP synthesis by DgcM. Finally, local heterogeneity of matrix production 
was found to be crucial for the tissue-like elasticity that allows for 
large-scale wrinkling and folding of macrocolony biofilms.

The green tea polyphenol EGCG inhibits E. coli biofilm formation by impairing 
amyloid curli fibre assembly and downregulating the biofilm regulator CsgD via 
the σ(E) -dependent sRNA RybB.

In bacterial biofilms, which are often involved in chronic infections, cells are 
surrounded by a self-produced extracellular matrix that contains amyloid fibres, 
exopolysaccharides and other biopolymers. The matrix contributes to the 
pronounced resistance of biofilms against antibiotics and host immune systems. 
Being highly inflammatory, matrix amyloids such as curli fibres of Escherichia 
coli can also play a role in pathogenicity. Using macrocolony biofilms of 
commensal and pathogenic E. coli as a model system, we demonstrate here that the 
green tea polyphenol epigallocatachin gallate (EGCG) is a potent antibiofilm 
agent. EGCG virtually eliminates the biofilm matrix by directly interfering with 
the assembly of curli subunits into amyloid fibres, and by triggering the σ(E) 
cell envelope stress response and thereby reducing the expression of CsgD - a 
crucial activator of curli and cellulose biosynthesis - due to csgD mRNA 
targeting by the σ(E) -dependent sRNA RybB. These findings highlight EGCG as a 
potential adjuvant for antibiotic therapy of biofilm-associated infections. 
Moreover, EGCG may support therapies against pathogenic E. coli that produce 
inflammatory curli fibres along with Shigatoxin.

Vertical stratification of matrix production is essential for physical integrity

Bacterial macrocolony biofilms grow into intricate three-dimensional structures 
that depend on self-produced extracellular polymers conferring protection, 
cohesion and elasticity to the biofilm. In Escherichia coli, synthesis of this 
matrix - consisting of amyloid curli fibres and cellulose - requires CsgD, a 
transcription factor regulated by the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS, and 
occurs in the nutrient-deprived cells of the upper layer of macrocolonies. Is 
this asymmetric matrix distribution functionally important or is it just a 
fortuitous by-product of an unavoidable nutrient gradient? In order to address 
this question, the RpoS-dependent csgD promoter was replaced by a vegetative 
promoter. This re-wiring of csgD led to CsgD and matrix production in both 
strata of macrocolonies, with the lower layer transforming into a rigid 'base 
plate' of growing yet curli-connected cells. As a result, the two strata broke 
apart followed by desiccation and exfoliation of the top layer. By contrast, 
matrix-free cells at the bottom of wild-type macrocolonies maintain colony 
contact with the humid agar support by flexibly filling the space that opens up 
under buckling areas of the macrocolony. Precisely regulated stratification in 
matrix-free and matrix-producing cell layers is thus essential for the physical 
integrity and architecture of E. coli macrocolony biofilms.

Amyloid curli fibers and cellulose are extracellular matrix components produced 
in the stationary phase top layer of E. coli macrocolonies, which confer 
physical protection, strong cohesion, elasticity, and wrinkled morphology to 
these biofilms. Curli and cellulose synthesis is controlled by a three-level 
transcription factor (TF) cascade with the RpoS sigma subunit of RNA polymerase 
at the top, the MerR-like TF MlrA, and the biofilm regulator CsgD, with two 
c-di-GMP control modules acting as key switching devices. Additional signal 
input and fine-tuning is provided by an entire series of small RNAs-ArcZ, DsrA, 
RprA, McaS, OmrA/OmrB, GcvB, and RydC--that differentially control all three TF 
modules by direct mRNA interaction. This review not only summarizes the 
mechanisms of action of these sRNAs, but also addresses the question of how 
these sRNAs and the regulators they target contribute to building the intriguing 
three-dimensional microarchitecture and macromorphology of these biofilms.

C-di-GMP-which is produced by diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and degraded by 
specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs)-is a ubiquitous second messenger in bacterial 
biofilm formation. In Escherichia coli, several DGCs (YegE, YdaM) and PDEs 
(YhjH, YciR) and the MerR-like transcription factor MlrA regulate the 
transcription of csgD, which encodes a biofilm regulator essential for producing 
amyloid curli fibres of the biofilm matrix. Here, we demonstrate that this 
system operates as a signalling cascade, in which c-di-GMP controlled by the 
DGC/PDE pair YegE/YhjH (module I) regulates the activity of the YdaM/YciR pair 
(module II). Via multiple direct interactions, the two module II proteins form a 
signalling complex with MlrA. YciR acts as a connector between modules I and II 
and functions as a trigger enzyme: its direct inhibition of the DGC YdaM is 
relieved when it binds and degrades c-di-GMP generated by module I. As a 
consequence, YdaM then generates c-di-GMP and-by direct and specific 
interaction-activates MlrA to stimulate csgD transcription. Trigger enzymes may 
represent a general principle in local c-di-GMP signalling.

Bacterial biofilms are highly structured multicellular communities whose 
formation involves flagella and an extracellular matrix of adhesins, amyloid 
fibers, and exopolysaccharides. Flagella are produced by still-dividing 
rod-shaped Escherichia coli cells during postexponential growth when nutrients 
become suboptimal. Upon entry into stationary phase, however, cells stop 
producing flagella, become ovoid, and generate amyloid curli fibers. These 
morphological changes, as well as accompanying global changes in gene expression 
and cellular physiology, depend on the induction of the stationary-phase sigma 
subunit of RNA polymerase, σ(S) (RpoS), the nucleotide second messengers cyclic 
AMP (cAMP), ppGpp, and cyclic-di-GMP, and a biofilm-controlling transcription 
factor, CsgD. Using flagella, curli fibers, a CsgD::GFP reporter, and cell 
morphology as "anatomical" hallmarks in fluorescence and scanning electron 
microscopy, different physiological zones in macrocolony biofilms of E. coli 
K-12 can be distinguished at cellular resolution. Small ovoid cells encased in a 
network of curli fibers form the outer biofilm layer. Inner regions are 
characterized by heterogeneous CsgD::GFP and curli expression. The bottom zone 
of the macrocolonies features elongated dividing cells and a tight mesh of 
entangled flagella, the formation of which requires flagellar motor function. 
Also, the cells in the outer-rim growth zone produce flagella, which wrap around 
and tether cells together. Adjacent to this growth zone, small chains and 
patches of shorter curli-surrounded cells appear side by side with flagellated 
curli-free cells before curli coverage finally becomes confluent, with 
essentially all cells in the surface layer being encased in "curli baskets."
IMPORTANCE: Heterogeneity or cellular differentiation in biofilms is a commonly 
accepted concept, but direct evidence at the microscale has been difficult to 
obtain. Our study reveals the microanatomy and microphysiology of an Escherichia 
coli macrocolony biofilm at an unprecedented cellular resolution, with 
physiologically different zones and strata forming as a function of known global 
regulatory networks that respond to biofilm-intrinsic gradients of nutrient 
supply. In addition, this study identifies zones of heterogeneous and 
potentially bistable CsgD and curli expression, shows bacterial curli networks 
to strikingly resemble Alzheimer plaques, and suggests a new role of flagella as 
an architectural element in biofilms.

Biofilm formation in Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria involves the 
inverse regulation of the synthesis of flagella and biofilm matrix components 
such as amyloid curli fibres, cellulose, colanic acid and 
poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PGA). Physiologically, these processes reflect the 
transition from growth to stationary phase. At the molecular level, they are 
tightly controlled by various sigma factors competing for RNA polymerase, a 
series of transcription factors acting in hierarchical regulatory cascades and 
several nucleotide messengers, including cyclic-di-GMP. In addition, a 
surprisingly large number of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) have been shown to 
directly or indirectly modulate motility and/or biofilm formation. This review 
aims at giving an overview of these sRNA regulators and their impact in biofilm 
formation in E. coli and Salmonella. Special emphasis will be put on sRNAs, that 
have known targets such as the mRNAs of the flagellar master regulator FlhDC, 
the stationary phase sigma factor σS (RpoS) and the key biofilm regulator CsgD 
that have recently been shown to act as major hubs for regulation by multiple 
sRNAs.

Molecular function and potential evolution of the biofilm-modulating blue

Escherichia coli senses blue light via the BLUF-EAL protein BluF (YcgF). The 
degenerate EAL domain of BluF does not have cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase 
activity, but BluF directly antagonizes the MerR-like repressor BluR (YcgE), 
which leads to expression of the ycgZ-ymgABC operon and activation of the Rcs 
system (Tschowri et al., 2009; Genes Dev 23: 522-534). While bluR, bluF and ycgZ 
have individual transcriptional start sites, comparative genome analysis 
indicates that the bluR-bluF-ycgZ-ymgAB region represents a functional unit in 
various enteric bacteria that is characterized by bluF alleles encoding 
degenerate EAL domains. Re-introducing conserved amino acids involved in 
phosphodiesterase activity of EAL domains did not restore enzymatic activity or 
c-di-GMP binding of BluF, but weakened its ability to antagonize BluR and 
improved a residual interaction with the BluR paralogue MlrA, which controls 
expression of the biofilm regulator CsgD and curli fibres. We identified the 
BluR binding site in the ycgZ promoter and observed that BluR also has residual 
affinity for the MlrA-dependent csgD promoter. Altogether, we propose that BluF 
evolved from a blue light-regulated PDE into a specific antagonist of a 
duplicate of MlrA that became BluR, which controls not only curli but various 
biofilm functions via the Ymg/Rcs pathway.

Targeting of csgD by the small regulatory RNA RprA links stationary phase,

RprA is a small regulatory RNA known to weakly affect the translation of σ(S) 
(RpoS) in Escherichia coli. Here we demonstrate that csgD, which encodes a 
stationary phase-induced biofilm regulator, as well as ydaM, which encodes a 
diguanylate cyclase involved in activating csgD transcription, are novel 
negatively controlled RprA targets. As shown by extensive mutational analysis, 
direct binding of RprA to the 5'-untranslated and translational initiation 
regions of csgD mRNA inhibits translation and reduces csgD mRNA levels. In the 
case of ydaM mRNA, RprA base-pairs directly downstream of the translational 
start codon. In a feedforward loop, RprA can thus downregulate > 30 
YdaM/CsgD-activated genes including those for adhesive curli fimbriae. However, 
during early stationary phase, when csgD transcription is strongly activated, 
the synthesis of csgD mRNA exceeds that of RprA, which allows the accumulation 
of CsgD protein. This situation is reversed when csgD transcription is shut off 
- for instance, later in stationary phase or during biofilm formation - or by 
conditions that further activate RprA expression via the Rcs two-component 
system. Thus, antagonistic regulation of csgD and RprA at the mRNA level 
integrates cell envelope stress signals with global gene expression during 
stationary phase and biofilm formation.

Switching from the motile planktonic bacterial lifestyle to a biofilm existence 
is stimulated by the signalling molecule bis-(3'-5')-cyclic-diguanosine 
monophosphate (cyclic-di-GMP), which is antagonistically controlled by 
diguanylate cyclases (DGCs; characterized by GGDEF domains) and specific 
phosphodiesterases (PDEs; mostly featuring EAL domains). Here, we present the 
expression patterns of all 28 genes that encode GGDEF/EAL domain proteins in 
Escherichia coli K-12. Twenty-one genes are expressed in Luria-Bertani medium, 
with 15 being under sigma(S) control. While a small subset of GGDEF/EAL proteins 
(YeaJ and YhjH) is dominant and modulates motility in post-exponentially growing 
cells, a diverse battery of GGDEF/EAL proteins is deployed during entry into 
stationary phase, especially in cells grown at reduced temperature (28 degrees 
C). This suggests that multiple signal input into cyclic-di-GMP control is 
particularly important in growth-restricted cells in an extra-host environment. 
Six GGDEF/EAL genes differentially control the expression of adhesive curli 
fimbriae. Besides the previously described ydaM, yciR, yegE and yhjH genes, 
these are yhdA (csrD), which stimulates the expression of the DGC YdaM and the 
major curli regulator CsgD, and yeaP, which contributes to expression of the 
curli structural operon csgBAC. Finally, we discuss why other GGDEF/EAL 
domain-encoding genes, despite being expressed, do not influence motility and/or 
curli formation.

Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and 
physiology in bacteria. RyhB is an iron-responsive sRNA well characterized in 
Escherichia coli and conserved in other Enterobacteriaceae. In this study, we 
identified and characterized two RyhB homologs (named RyhB-1 and RyhB-2) in the 
fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri. We found that, as in other Enterobacteriaceae, 
both RyhB-1 and RyhB-2 are induced under iron starvation, repressed by the Fur 
regulator, and depend on Hfq for stability. Despite these similarities in 
expression, the mutant strains of Y. ruckeri lacking RyhB-1 (ΔryhB-1) or RyhB-2 
(ΔryhB-2) exhibited differential phenotypes. In comparison with the wild type, 
the ΔryhB-1 strain showed a hypermotile phenotype, reduced biofilm formation, 
increased replication rate, faster growth, and increased ATP levels in bacterial 
cultures. By contrast, in salmon cell cultures, the ΔryhB-1 strain exhibited an 
increased survival. On the other hand, the ΔryhB-2 strain was non-motile and 
showed augmented biofilm formation as compared to the wild type. The expression 
of a subset of RyhB conserved targets, selected from different bacterial 
species, was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in wild type, ΔryhB-1, ΔryhB-2, and 
ΔryhB-1 ΔryhB-2 strains cultured in iron-depleted media. RyhB-1 negatively 
affected the expression of most analyzed genes (sodB, acnA, sdhC, bfr, fliF, 
among others), whose functions are related to metabolism and motility, involving 
iron-containing proteins. Among the genes analyzed, only sdhC and bfr appeared 
as targets for RyhB-2. Taken together, these results indicate that Y. ruckeri 
RyhB homologs participate in the modulation of the bacterial physiology with 
non-redundant roles.

Aconitases (Acn) are iron-sulfur proteins that catalyse the reversible 
isomerization of citrate and isocitrate via the intermediate cis-aconitate in 
the Krebs cycle. Some Acn proteins are bi-functional and under conditions of 
iron starvation and oxidative stress lose their iron-sulfur clusters and become 
post-transcriptional regulators by binding specific mRNA targets. Many bacterial 
species possess two genetically distinct aconitase proteins, AcnA and AcnB. 
Current understanding of the regulation and functions of AcnA and AcnB in dual 
Acn bacteria is based on a model developed in Escherichia coli. Thus, AcnB is 
the major Krebs cycle enzyme expressed during exponential growth, whereas AcnA 
is a more stable, stationary phase and stress-induced enzyme, and both E. coli 
Acns are bi-functional. Here a second dual Acn bacterium, Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), has been analysed. Phenotypic traits of S. 
Typhimurium acn mutants were consistent with AcnB acting as the major Acn 
protein. Promoter fusion experiments indicated that acnB transcription was 
~10-fold greater than that of acnA and that acnA expression was regulated by the 
cyclic-AMP receptor protein (CRP, glucose starvation), the fumarate nitrate 
reduction regulator (FNR, oxygen starvation), the ferric uptake regulator (Fur, 
iron starvation) and the superoxide response protein (SoxR, oxidative stress). 
In contrast to E. coli, S. Typhimurium acnA was not induced in the stationary 
phase. Furthermore, acnA expression was enhanced in an acnB mutant, presumably 
to partially compensate for the lack of AcnB activity. Isolated S. Typhimurium 
AcnA protein had kinetic and mRNA-binding properties similar to those described 
for E. coli AcnA. Thus, the work reported here provides a second example of the 
regulation and function of AcnA and AcnB proteins in a dual Acn bacterium.

RyhB control.

BACKGROUND: It is well established in E. coli and Vibrio cholerae that strains 
harboring mutations in the ferric uptake regulator gene (fur) are unable to 
utilize tricarboxylic acid (TCA) compounds, due to the down-regulation of key 
TCA cycle enzymes, such as AcnA and SdhABCD. This down-regulation is mediated by 
a Fur-regulated small regulatory RNA named RyhB. It is unclear in the 
γ-proteobacterium S. oneidensis whether TCA is also regulated by Fur and RyhB.
RESULTS: In the present study, we showed that a fur deletion mutant of S. 
oneidensis could utilize TCA compounds. Consistently, expression of the TCA 
cycle genes acnA and sdhA was not down-regulated in the mutant. To explore this 
observation further, we identified a ryhB gene in Shewanella species and 
experimentally demonstrated the gene expression. Further experiments suggested 
that RyhB was up-regulated in fur mutant, but that AcnA and SdhA were not 
controlled by RyhB.
CONCLUSIONS: These cumulative results delineate an important difference of the 
Fur-RyhB regulatory cycle between S. oneidensis and other γ-proteobacteria. This 
work represents a step forward for understanding the unique regulation in S. 
oneidensis.

Mutants with defects in components of the glutathione-glutaredoxin (GSH/Grx) 
system of Rhodobacter capsulatus were constructed to study its role in defense 
against oxidative stress and the redox-dependent formation of photosynthetic 
complexes. The lack of the glutaredoxin 3 gene (grxC) or the glutathione 
synthetase B gene (gshB) resulted in lower growth rates under aerobic conditions 
and higher sensitivity to oxidative stress, confirming the role of the GSH/Grx 
system in oxidative stress defense. Both mutants are highly sensitive to 
disulfide stress, indicating a major contribution of the GSH/Grx system to the 
thiol-disulfide redox buffer in the cytoplasm. Like mutations in the thioredoxin 
system, mutations in the GSH/Grx system affected the formation of photosynthetic 
complexes, which is redox dependent in R. capsulatus. Expression of the genes 
grxC, gshB, grxA for glutaredoxin 1, and gorA for glutathione reductase, all 
encoding components of the GSH/Grx system, was not induced by oxidative stress. 
Other genes, for which a role in oxidative stress was established in Escherichia 
coli, acnA, fpr, fur, and katG, were strongly induced by oxidative stress in R. 
capsulatus. Mutations in the grxC, and/or gshB, and/or trxC (thioredoxin 2) 
genes affected expression of these genes, indicating an interplay of the 
different defense systems against oxidative stress. The OxyR and the SoxRS 
regulons control the expression of many genes involved in oxidative stress 
defense in E. coli in response to H2O2 and superoxide, respectively. Our data 
and the available genome sequence of R. capsulatus suggest that a SoxRS system 
is lacking but an alternative superoxide specific regulator exists in R. 
capsulatus. While the expression of gorA and grxA is regulated by H2O2 in E. 
coli this is not the case in R. capsulatus, indicating that the OxyR regulons of 
these two species are significantly different.

A small RNA regulates the expression of genes involved in iron metabolism in 
Escherichia coli.

5132, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

A small RNA, RyhB, was found as part of a genomewide search for novel small RNAs 
in Escherichia coli. The RyhB 90-nt RNA down-regulates a set of iron-storage and 
iron-using proteins when iron is limiting; it is itself negatively regulated by 
the ferric uptake repressor protein, Fur (Ferric uptake regulator). RyhB RNA 
levels are inversely correlated with mRNA levels for the sdhCDAB operon, 
encoding succinate dehydrogenase, as well as five other genes previously shown 
to be positively regulated by Fur by an unknown mechanism. These include two 
other genes encoding enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, acnA and fumA, two 
ferritin genes, ftnA and bfr, and a gene for superoxide dismutase, sodB. Fur 
positive regulation of all these genes is fully reversed in an ryhB mutant. Our 
results explain the previously observed inability of fur mutants to grow on 
succinate. RyhB requires the RNA-binding protein, Hfq, for activity. Sequences 
within RyhB are complementary to regions within each of the target genes, 
suggesting that RyhB acts as an antisense RNA. In sdhCDAB, the complementary 
region is at the end of the first gene of the sdhCDAB operon; full-length 
sdhCDAB message disappears and a truncated message, equivalent in size to the 
region upstream of the complementarity, is detected when RyhB is expressed. RyhB 
provides a mechanism for the cell to down-regulate iron-storage proteins and 
nonessential iron-containing proteins when iron is limiting, thus modulating 
intracellular iron usage to supplement mechanisms for iron uptake directly 
regulated by Fur.

Transcriptional regulation of the aconitase genes (acnA and acnB) of Escherichia

Escherichia coli contains two differentially regulated aconitase genes, acnA and 
acnB. Two acnA promoters transcribing from start points located 407 bp (P1acnA) 
and 50 bp (P2acnA) upstream of the acnA coding region, and one acnB promoter 
(PacnB) with a start point 95 bp upstream of the acnB coding region, were 
identified by primer extension analysis. A 2.8 kb acnA monocistronic transcript 
was detected by Northern blot hybridization, but only in redox-stressed 
(methyl-viologen-treated) cultures, and a 2.5 kb acnB monocistronic transcript 
was detected in exponential- but not stationary-phase cultures. These findings 
are consistent with previous observations that acnA is specifically subject to 
SoxRS-mediated activation, whereas acnB encodes the major aconitase that is 
synthesized earlier in the growth cycle than AcnA. Further studies with acn-lacZ 
gene fusions and a wider range of transcription regulators indicated that acnA 
expression is initiated by sigma 38 from P1acnA, and from P2acnA it is activated 
directly or indirectly by CRP, FruR, Fur and SoxRS, and repressed by ArcA and 
FNR. In contrast, acnB expression is activated by CRP and repressed by ArcA, 
FruR and Fis from PacnB. Comparable studies with fum-lacZ fusions indicated that 
transcription of fumC, but not of fumA or fumB, is initiated by RNA polymerase 
containing sigma 38. It is concluded that AcnB is the major citric acid cycle 
enzyme, whereas AcnA is an aerobic stationary-phase enzyme that is specifically 
induced by iron and redox-stress.

Two genetically-distinct and differentially-regulated aconitases (AcnA and AcnB) 
in Escherichia coli.

An acnA mutant of Escherichia coli was constructed by replacing the chromosomal 
acnA gene by an internally deleted derivative containing a kanR cassette. 
Southern and Western blotting confirmed that the acnA gene had been replaced by 
the disrupted gene and that the aconitase A protein was no longer expressed. 
However, the mutant failed to exhibit the anticipated glutamate auxotrophy and 
it retained a residual aconitase activity. This activity was due to an analogous 
unstable enzyme(s) designated aconitase B. Studies on the regulation of 
aconitase A synthesis using an acnA-lacZ translational fusion showed that the 
acnA gene resembles other citric acid cycle genes in being subject to 
CRP-mediated catabolite repression and ArcA-mediated anaerobic repression. In 
addition to being activated by the SoxRS oxidative stress regulatory system, the 
acnA gene appeared to be activated by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur). It was 
concluded that the acnA gene belongs to at least four global regulatory 
networks, crp, arcA, fur and soxRS. In contrast, the aconitase B activity 
decreased after exposure to oxidative stress and was less affected by 
anaerobiosis. Comparable studies with the fumarase genes (fumA, B and C) 
indicated that fumA (encoding the unstable aerobic iron-sulphur-containing 
fumarase) is activated by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) and fumC (encoding 
the stable fumarase) is activated by the SoxRS oxidative stress regulatory 
system.

Post-transcriptional regulatory processes may change transcript levels and 
affect cell-to-cell variability or noise. We study small-RNA downregulation to 
elucidate its effects on noise in the iron homeostasis network of Escherichia 
coli In this network, the small-RNA RyhB undergoes stoichiometric degradation 
with the transcripts of target genes in response to iron stress. Using 
single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, we measured transcript 
numbers of the RyhB-regulated genes sodB and fumA in individual cells as a 
function of iron deprivation. We observed a monotonic increase of noise with 
iron stress but no evidence of theoretically predicted, enhanced stoichiometric 
fluctuations in transcript numbers, nor of bistable behavior in transcript 
distributions. Direct detection of RyhB in individual cells shows that its noise 
is much smaller than that of these two targets, when RyhB production is 
significant. A generalized two-state model of bursty transcription that neglects 
RyhB fluctuations describes quantitatively the dependence of noise and 
transcript distributions on iron deprivation, enabling extraction of in vivo 
RyhB-mediated transcript degradation rates. The transcripts' threshold-linear 
behavior indicates that the effective in vivo interaction strength between RyhB 
and its two target transcripts is comparable. Strikingly, the bacterial cell 
response exhibits Fur-dependent, switch-like activation instead of a graded 
response to iron deprivation.

Mesaconase/Fumarase FumD in Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Promiscuity of 
Escherichia coli Class I Fumarases FumA and FumB.

Mesaconase catalyzes the hydration of mesaconate (methylfumarate) to 
(S)-citramalate. The enzyme participates in the methylaspartate pathway of 
glutamate fermentation as well as in the metabolism of various C5-dicarboxylic 
acids such as mesaconate or L-threo-β-methylmalate. We have recently shown that 
Burkholderia xenovorans uses a promiscuous class I fumarase to catalyze this 
reaction in the course of mesaconate utilization. Here we show that classical 
Escherichia coli class I fumarases A and B (FumA and FumB) are capable of 
hydrating mesaconate with 4% (FumA) and 19% (FumB) of the catalytic efficiency 
kcat/Km, compared to the physiological substrate fumarate. Furthermore, the 
genomes of 14.8% of sequenced Enterobacteriaceae (26.5% of E. coli, 90.6% of E. 
coli O157:H7 strains) possess an additional class I fumarase homologue which we 
designated as fumarase D (FumD). All these organisms are (opportunistic) 
pathogens. fumD is clustered with the key genes for two enzymes of the 
methylaspartate pathway of glutamate fermentation, glutamate mutase and 
methylaspartate ammonia lyase, converting glutamate to mesaconate. 
Heterologously produced FumD was a promiscuous mesaconase/fumarase with a 2- to 
3-fold preference for mesaconate over fumarate. Therefore, these bacteria have 
the genetic potential to convert glutamate to (S)-citramalate, but the further 
fate of citramalate is still unclear. Our bioinformatic analysis identified 
several other putative mesaconase genes and revealed that mesaconases probably 
evolved several times from various class I fumarases independently. Most, if not 
all iron-dependent fumarases, are capable to catalyze mesaconate hydration.

Functional interactions between the carbon and iron utilization regulators, Crp 
and Fur, in Escherichia coli.

In Escherichia coli, the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) controls expression of 
the iron regulon in response to iron availability while the cyclic AMP receptor 
protein (Crp) regulates expression of the carbon regulon in response to carbon 
availability. We here identify genes subject to significant changes in 
expression level in response to the loss of both Fur and Crp. Many iron 
transport genes and several carbon metabolic genes are subject to dual control, 
being repressed by the loss of Crp and activated by the loss of Fur. However, 
the sodB gene, encoding superoxide dismutase, and the aceBAK operon, encoding 
the glyoxalate shunt enzymes, show the opposite responses, being activated by 
the loss of Crp and repressed by the loss of Fur. Several other genes including 
the sdhA-D, sucA-D, and fumA genes, encoding key constituents of the Krebs 
cycle, proved to be repressed by the loss of both transcription factors. 
Finally, the loss of both Crp and Fur activated a heterogeneous group of genes 
under sigmaS control encoding, for example, the cyclopropane fatty acid 
synthase, Cfa, the glycogen synthesis protein, GlgS, the 30S ribosomal protein, 
S22, and the mechanosensitive channel protein, YggB. Many genes appeared to be 
regulated by the two transcription factors in an apparently additive fashion, 
but apparent positive or negative cooperativity characterized several putative 
Crp/Fur interactions. Relevant published data were evaluated, putative Crp and 
Fur binding sites were identified, and representative results were confirmed by 
real-time PCR. Molecular explanations for some, but not all, of these effects 
are provided.

Regulation of fumarase (fumB) gene expression in Escherichia coli in response to

products.

Three distinct fumarases, FumA, FumB and FumC, have been reported in Escherichia 
coli. While the fumA and fumC gene products are expressed under aerobic cell 
growth conditions, the FumB fumarase appears to be more abundant during 
anaerobic growth. To study the transcriptional regulation of the fumB gene, a 
fumB-lacZ operon fusion was constructed and analyzed in a single copy under a 
variety of cell culture conditions. Expression of fumB-lacZ was fourfold higher 
under anaerobic than aerobic growth conditions. This anaerobic response is 
modulated by the ArcA and Fnr proteins, which function independently as 
anaerobic activators of fumB gene expression. Cellular iron limitation in a fur 
mutant caused fumB-lacZ expression to decrease sevenfold while cellular heme 
limitation decreased fumB gene expression twofold. In addition, fumB-lacZ 
expression was shown to vary depending on the DNA superhelicity. This study 
further delineates the regulation of the fumB gene in cell growth.

Fourtythree strains of the genus Sphingomonas and close relatives were subjected 
to riboprint analyses generated after digestion of genomic DNA with the 
restriction enzyme EcoRI and hybridization with E. coli rrnB operon. The 
majority of strains were characterized by a complex banding pattern in the 
riboprints. High degrees of similarities in the riboprints were only observed 
among strains of the same species such as S. yanoikuyae, S. aromaticivorans, S. 
subarctica and S. chlorophenolica. Strains of different species including close 
phylogenetic relatives such as S. asaccharolytica, S. mali and S. pruni were 
easily distinguished by the differences in the riboprints even after visual 
evaluation. Thus, our data demonstrate that riboprint analysis is useful for 
preliminary identification of new sphingomonad isolates at the species level.

Two immunogenic proteins, Sm31 and Sm32, originating from the gut of Schistosoma 
mansoni were evaluated for their potential as recombinant immunodiagnostic 
reagents. Sm31 and Sm32 cDNA fragments were cloned and expressed in Escherichia 
coli as polypeptides fused to RNA polymerase of bacteriophage MS2. The 
recombinant proteins were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) 
with paired sera of 182 persons from Mali with S. mansoni and S. haematobium 
infections collected before and one year after treatment with praziquantel. 
Pretreatment sera of the study population gave a strong antibody response to 
Sm31 and Sm32 in immunoblots of total worm extract with the sera. The 
sensitivities of both western blotting (86%) and ELISA (75%) using Sm31 and Sm32 
fusion proteins compared well with a single egg count (84%). Chemotherapy 
resulted in an overall decline of egg counts. Posttreatment sera gave 
significantly lower reactivities than the pretreatment sera. Our results 
demonstrate the feasibility of detecting circulating antibodies with recombinant 
antigens in schistosomiasis.

Plasmid profiles of strains of Lactobacillus curvatus and L. sake isolated from 
meat or sauerkraut were analysed to investigate plasmid homology and 
distribution in relation to the ecology of these organisms in fermenting foods. 
A hybridisation probe was constructed by cloning of pLc2, a cryptic, 2.6-kbp 
plasmid from L. curvatus LTH683, into the Escherichia coli plasmid pRV50. In 
Southern hybridisations with the digoxygenine labeled pLc2 probe, pLc2-related 
small plasmids were frequently detected in meat-borne strains of L. casei subsp. 
pseudoplantarum, L. curvatus, L. sake, L. alimentarius, L. farciminis and L. 
halotolerans and in L. curvatus and L. sake isolated from sauerkraut. Among 27 
Lactobacillus type strains originally isolated from habitats other than meat 
this type of homology was detected only with plasmids of L. buchneri and L. 
mali. Restriction-enzyme mapping of six small cryptic plasmids from L. curvatus 
and L. sake revealed strong structural homology but no similarity to previously 
characterized plasmids of lactobacilli. The presence of a variable region in 
addition to a conserved one and the occurrence of deletions during cloning of 
pLc2 suggest that vectors derived from these plasmids are likely to be 
structurally unstable.

We have undertaken a systematic search for T cell epitopes within the sequence 
of the major merozoite surface antigen (GP190) of Plasmodium falciparum. 
Recombinant polypeptides expressed in E. coli were used to evaluate the 
reactivity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from both inhabitants of 
a rural community of West Africa exposed to P. falciparum transmission and from 
German patients with diagnosis of acute malaria. Although the proliferative 
response of the PBMC was in most cases very low, several T cell clones could be 
established. Deletion analysis of each gp190-derived polypeptide allowed the 
identification of six different T cell epitopes. Epitopes could be mapped within 
the dimorphic region of gp190, which also contains the sequences most frequently 
recognized by sera from adult individuals living in endemic areas.

Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and 
physiology in bacteria. RyhB is an iron-responsive sRNA well characterized in 
Escherichia coli and conserved in other Enterobacteriaceae. In this study, we 
identified and characterized two RyhB homologs (named RyhB-1 and RyhB-2) in the 
fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri. We found that, as in other Enterobacteriaceae, 
both RyhB-1 and RyhB-2 are induced under iron starvation, repressed by the Fur 
regulator, and depend on Hfq for stability. Despite these similarities in 
expression, the mutant strains of Y. ruckeri lacking RyhB-1 (ΔryhB-1) or RyhB-2 
(ΔryhB-2) exhibited differential phenotypes. In comparison with the wild type, 
the ΔryhB-1 strain showed a hypermotile phenotype, reduced biofilm formation, 
increased replication rate, faster growth, and increased ATP levels in bacterial 
cultures. By contrast, in salmon cell cultures, the ΔryhB-1 strain exhibited an 
increased survival. On the other hand, the ΔryhB-2 strain was non-motile and 
showed augmented biofilm formation as compared to the wild type. The expression 
of a subset of RyhB conserved targets, selected from different bacterial 
species, was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in wild type, ΔryhB-1, ΔryhB-2, and 
ΔryhB-1 ΔryhB-2 strains cultured in iron-depleted media. RyhB-1 negatively 
affected the expression of most analyzed genes (sodB, acnA, sdhC, bfr, fliF, 
among others), whose functions are related to metabolism and motility, involving 
iron-containing proteins. Among the genes analyzed, only sdhC and bfr appeared 
as targets for RyhB-2. Taken together, these results indicate that Y. ruckeri 
RyhB homologs participate in the modulation of the bacterial physiology with 
non-redundant roles.

BACKGROUND: Serratia plymuthica WS3236 was selected for whole genome sequencing 
based on preliminary genetic and chemical screening indicating the presence of 
multiple natural product pathways. This led to the identification of a putative 
sodorifen biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). The natural product sodorifen is a 
volatile organic compound (VOC) with an unusual polymethylated hydrocarbon 
bicyclic structure (C16H26) produced by selected strains of S. plymuthica. The 
BGC encoding sodorifen consists of four genes, two of which (sodA, sodB) are 
homologs of genes encoding enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway and are thought 
to enhance the amounts of available farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), the precursor 
of sodorifen. Proceeding from FPP, only two enzymes are necessary to produce 
sodorifen: an S-adenosyl methionine dependent methyltransferase (SodC) with 
additional cyclisation activity and a terpene-cyclase (SodD). Previous analysis 
of S. plymuthica found sodorifen production titers are generally low and vary 
significantly among different producer strains. This precludes studies on the 
still elusive biological function of this structurally and biosynthetically 
fascinating bacterial terpene.
RESULTS: Sequencing and mining of the S. plymuthica WS3236 genome revealed the 
presence of 38 BGCs according to antiSMASH analysis, including a putative 
sodorifen BGC. Further genome mining for sodorifen and sodorifen-like BGCs 
throughout bacteria was performed using SodC and SodD as queries and identified 
a total of 28 sod-like gene clusters. Using direct pathway cloning (DiPaC) we 
intercepted the 4.6 kb candidate sodorifen BGC from S. plymuthica WS3236 
(sodA-D) and transformed it into Escherichia coli BL21. Heterologous expression 
under the control of the tetracycline inducible PtetO promoter firmly linked 
this BGC to sodorifen production. By utilizing this newly established expression 
system, we increased the production yields by approximately 26-fold when 
compared to the native producer. In addition, sodorifen was easily isolated in 
high purity by simple head-space sampling.
CONCLUSIONS: Genome mining of all available genomes within the NCBI and JGI IMG 
databases led to the identification of a wealth of sod-like pathways which may 
be responsible for producing a range of structurally unknown sodorifen analogs. 
Introduction of the S. plymuthica WS3236 sodorifen BGC into the fast-growing 
heterologous expression host E. coli with a very low VOC background led to a 
significant increase in both sodorifen product yield and purity compared to the 
native producer. By providing a reliable, high-level production system, this 
study sets the stage for future investigations of the biological role and 
function of sodorifen and for functionally unlocking the bioinformatically 
identified putative sod-like pathways.

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) renders bacteria highly resistant to oxidative 
stress, but its mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we report that 
3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) is the major source of endogenous 
H2S in Escherichia coli Cellular resistance to H2O2 strongly depends on the 
activity of mstA, a gene that encodes 3MST. Deletion of the ferric uptake 
regulator (Fur) renders ∆mstA cells hypersensitive to H2O2 Conversely, induction 
of chromosomal mstA from a strong pLtetO-1 promoter (P tet -mstA) renders ∆fur 
cells fully resistant to H2O2 Furthermore, the endogenous level of H2S is 
reduced in ∆fur or ∆sodA ∆sodB cells but restored after the addition of an iron 
chelator dipyridyl. Using a highly sensitive reporter of the global response to 
DNA damage (SOS) and the TUNEL assay, we show that 3MST-derived H2S protects 
chromosomal DNA from oxidative damage. We also show that the induction of the 
CysB regulon in response to oxidative stress depends on 3MST, whereas the 
CysB-regulated l-cystine transporter, TcyP, plays the principle role in the 
3MST-mediated generation of H2S. These findings led us to propose a model to 
explain the interplay between l-cysteine metabolism, H2S production, and 
oxidative stress, in which 3MST protects E. coli against oxidative stress via 
l-cysteine utilization and H2S-mediated sequestration of free iron necessary for 
the genotoxic Fenton reaction.

Post-transcriptional regulatory processes may change transcript levels and 
affect cell-to-cell variability or noise. We study small-RNA downregulation to 
elucidate its effects on noise in the iron homeostasis network of Escherichia 
coli In this network, the small-RNA RyhB undergoes stoichiometric degradation 
with the transcripts of target genes in response to iron stress. Using 
single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, we measured transcript 
numbers of the RyhB-regulated genes sodB and fumA in individual cells as a 
function of iron deprivation. We observed a monotonic increase of noise with 
iron stress but no evidence of theoretically predicted, enhanced stoichiometric 
fluctuations in transcript numbers, nor of bistable behavior in transcript 
distributions. Direct detection of RyhB in individual cells shows that its noise 
is much smaller than that of these two targets, when RyhB production is 
significant. A generalized two-state model of bursty transcription that neglects 
RyhB fluctuations describes quantitatively the dependence of noise and 
transcript distributions on iron deprivation, enabling extraction of in vivo 
RyhB-mediated transcript degradation rates. The transcripts' threshold-linear 
behavior indicates that the effective in vivo interaction strength between RyhB 
and its two target transcripts is comparable. Strikingly, the bacterial cell 
response exhibits Fur-dependent, switch-like activation instead of a graded 
response to iron deprivation.

A mixed incoherent feed-forward loop allows conditional regulation of response 
dynamics.

Expression of the SodA superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in Escherichia coli is 
regulated by superoxide concentration through the SoxRS system and also by Fur 
(Ferric uptake regulator) through a mixed incoherent feed forward loop (FFL) 
containing the RyhB small regulatory RNA. In this work I theoretically analyze 
the function of this feed forward loop as part of the network controlling 
expression of the two cytoplasmic superoxide dismutases, SodA and SodB. I find 
that feed forward regulation allows faster response to superoxide stress at low 
intracellular iron levels compared to iron rich conditions. That is, it can 
conditionally modulate the response time of a superimposed transcriptional 
control mechanism.

The Fur regulon in anaerobically grown Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium: 
identification of new Fur targets.

BACKGROUND: The Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a transcriptional regulator 
that controls iron homeostasis in bacteria. Although the regulatory role of Fur 
in Escherichia coli is well characterized, most of the studies were conducted 
under routine culture conditions, i.e., in ambient oxygen concentration. To 
reveal potentially novel aspects of the Fur regulon in Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium under oxygen conditions similar to that encountered in the 
host, we compared the transcriptional profiles of the virulent wild-type strain 
(ATCC 14028s) and its isogenic Δfur strain under anaerobic conditions.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis of anaerobically grown Δfur S. Typhimurium 
identified 298 differentially expressed genes. Expression of several genes 
controlled by Fnr and NsrR appeared to be also dependent on Fur. Furthermore, 
Fur was required for the activity of the cytoplasmic superoxide disumutases 
(MnSOD and FeSOD). The regulation of FeSOD gene, sodB, occurred via small RNAs 
(i.e., the ryhB homologs, rfrA and rfrB) with the aid of the RNA chaperone Hfq. 
The transcription of sodA was increased in Δfur; however, the enzyme was 
inactive due to the incorporation of iron instead of manganese in SodA. 
Additionally, in Δfur, the expression of the gene coding for the ferritin-like 
protein (ftnB) was down-regulated, while the transcription of the gene coding 
for the nitric oxide (NO·) detoxifying flavohemoglobin (hmpA) was up-regulated. 
The promoters of ftnB and hmpA do not contain recognized Fur binding motifs, 
which indicated their probable indirect regulation by Fur. However, Fur 
activation of ftnB was independent of Fnr. In addition, the expression of the 
gene coding for the histone-like protein, H-NS (hns) was increased in Δfur. This 
may explain the observed down-regulation of the tdc operon, responsible for the 
anaerobic degradation of threonine, and ftnB in Δfur.
CONCLUSIONS: This study determined that Fur is a positive factor in ftnB 
regulation, while serving to repress the expression of hmpA. Furthermore, Fur is 
required for the proper expression and activation of the antioxidant enzymes, 
FeSOD and MnSOD. Finally, this work identified twenty-six new targets of Fur 
regulation, and demonstrates that H-NS repressed genes are down-regulated in 
Δfur.

Previous microarray studies have suggested that an indirect mechanism of Fur 
regulation may be present in meningococcus at the posttranscriptional level 
through a small regulatory RNA (sRNA) system analogous to that of Escherichia 
coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recently, a Fur-regulated sRNA, NrrF, was 
identified that is involved in the iron regulation of the sdhA and sdhC 
succinate dehydrogenase genes. Here we report a detailed transcriptional 
analysis of the nrrF gene and show that NrrF is a Hfq-dependent sRNA. The Hfq 
protein mediates nrrF downregulation and Fur-dependent upregulation of the 
sdhCDAB operon, the major in vivo NrrF-regulated operon. NrrF forms a duplex in 
vitro with a region of complementarity overlapping the sdhDA mRNA junction. 
Furthermore, Hfq binds to NrrF in vitro and considerably enhances the efficiency 
of the interaction of the sRNA with the identified target. Our data suggest that 
Hfq-meditated binding of NrrF to the in vivo target in the sdhCDAB mRNA may 
cause the rapid degradation of the transcript, resulting in Fur-dependent 
positive regulation of succinate dehydrogenase. In addition, while the 
upregulation of sodB and fumB by Fur is dependent on the Hfq protein, it is 
unaffected in the nrrF knockout, which suggests that there is more than one sRNA 
regulator involved in iron homeostasis in meningococcus.

Gordonia westfalica Kb1 and Gordonia polyisoprenivorans VH2 induce the formation 
of an extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) during poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) 
degradation. To investigate the function of this enzyme in G. polyisoprenivorans 
VH2, the sodA gene was disrupted. The mutants exhibited reduced growth in liquid 
mineral salt media containing poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) as the sole carbon and 
energy source, and no SOD activity was detectable in the supernatants of the 
cultures. Growth experiments revealed that SodA activity is required for optimal 
growth on poly(cis-1,4-isoprene), whereas this enzyme has no effect on aerobic 
growth in the presence of water-soluble substrates like succinate, acetate, and 
propionate. This was detected by activity staining, and proof of expression was 
by antibody detection of SOD. When SodA from G. westfalica Kb1 was 
heterologously expressed in the sodA sodB double mutant Escherichia coli QC779, 
the recombinant mutant exhibited increased resistance to paraquat, thereby 
indicating the functionality of the G. westfalica Kb1 SodA and indirectly 
protection of G. westfalica cells by SodA from oxidative damage. Both sodA from 
G. polyisoprenivorans VH2 and sodA from G. westfalica Kb1 coded for polypeptides 
comprising 209 amino acids and having approximately 90% and 70% identical amino 
acids, respectively, to the SodA from Mycobacterium smegmatis strain MC(2) 155 
and Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665. As revealed by activity staining experiments 
with the wild type and the disruption mutant of G. polyisoprenivorans, this 
bacterium harbors only one active SOD belonging to the manganese family. The 
N-terminal sequences of the extracellular SodA proteins of both Gordonia species 
showed no evidence of leader peptides for the mature proteins, like the 
intracellular SodA protein of G. polyisoprenivorans VH2, which was purified 
under native conditions from the cells. In G. westfalica Kb1 and G. 
polyisoprenivorans VH2, SodA probably provides protection against reactive 
oxygen intermediates which occur during degradation of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene).

Up-expression of NapA and other oxidative stress proteins is a compensatory 
response to loss of major Helicobacter pylori stress resistance factors.

Twenty-six Helicobacter pylori targeted mutant strains with deficiencies in 
oxidative stress combating proteins, including 12 double mutant strains were 
analyzed via physiological and proteomic approaches to distinguish the major 
expression changes caused by the mutations. Mutations were introduced into both 
a Mtz(S) and a Mtz(R) strain background. Most of the mutations caused increased 
growth sensitivity of the strains to oxygen, and they all exhibited clear 
compensatory up-expression of oxidative stress resistance proteins enabling 
survival of the bacterium. The most frequent up-expressed oxidative stress 
resistance factor (observed in 16 of the mutants) was the iron-sequestering 
protein NapA, linking iron sequestration with oxidative stress resistance. The 
up-expression of individual proteins in mutants ranged from 2 to 10 fold that of 
the wild type strain, even when incubated in a low O(2) environment. For 
example, a considerably higher level of catalase expression (4 fold of that in 
the wild-type strain) was observed in ahpC napA and ahpC sodB double mutants. A 
Fur mutant up-expressed ferritin (Pfr) protein 20-fold. In some mutant strains 
the bacterial DNA is protected from oxidative stress damage apparently via 
overexpression of oxidative stress-combating proteins such as NapA, catalase or 
MdaB (an NADPH quinone reductase). Our results show that H. pylori has a variety 
of ways to compensate for loss of major oxidative stress combating factors.

RyhB is a noncoding RNA regulated by the Fur repressor. It has previously been 
shown to cause the rapid degradation of a number of mRNAs that encode proteins 
that utilize iron. Here we examine the effect of ectopic RyhB production on 
global gene expression by microarray analysis. Many of the previously identified 
targets were found, as well as other mRNAs encoding iron-binding proteins, 
bringing the total number of regulated operons to at least 18, encoding 56 
genes. The two major operons involved in Fe-S cluster assembly showed different 
behavior; the isc operon appears to be a direct target of RyhB action, while the 
suf operon does not. This is consistent with previous findings suggesting that 
the suf genes but not the isc genes are important for Fe-S cluster synthesis 
under iron-limiting conditions, presumably for essential iron-binding proteins. 
In addition, we observed repression of Fur-regulated genes upon RyhB expression, 
interpreted as due to intracellular iron sparing resulting from reduced 
synthesis of iron-binding proteins. Our results demonstrate the broad effects of 
a single noncoding RNA on iron homeostasis.

tcf (Typhi colonization factor) is one of the 12 putative chaperone/usher 
fimbrial clusters present in the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi genome. We 
investigated the production, expression and regulation of tcf as well as its 
role during interaction with human cells. The tcf gene cluster was cloned and 
induced in Escherichia coli and S. Typhi, and the production of intertwined 
fibres similar to the Cbl (cable) pili of Burkholderia cepacia was observed on 
the bacterial surface by electron microscopy. In S. Typhi, tcf was expressed 
more after growth in M63 minimal medium than in standard Luria-Bertani medium. 
Analysis of the promoter region identified putative binding sites for the global 
regulators RcsB, ArgR and Fur. The expression of tcf was measured in isogenic 
strains lacking these global regulators. Under the conditions tested, the 
results showed that tcf expression was higher in the fur mutant and was 
regulated by iron concentration. Fur may regulate these fimbriae indirectly via 
the small RNAs RyhB1 and RyhB2. An isogenic mutant harbouring a deletion of the 
tcf cluster did not demonstrate any defect in adhesion or invasion of human 
epithelial cells, or in phagocytosis or survival in macrophages, when compared 
to the WT serovar Typhi strain. However, the tcf cluster contributed to 
adherence to human epithelial cells when introduced into E. coli. Thus, tcf 
genes encode functional fimbriae that can act as an adhesin and may contribute 
to colonization during typhoid fever.

Regulation of aspartate-derived amino acid homeostasis in potato plants (Solanum 
tuberosum L.) by expression of E. coli homoserine kinase.

The availability of the carbon backbone O-phosphohomoserine (OPHS) is critical 
to methionine (met) and threonine (thr) synthesis. OPHS derives from homoserine 
and is formed by homoserine kinase (HSK). To clarify the function of HSK in 
cellular metabolism, the E. coli HSK ortholog thrB was expressed in potato 
plants targeting the EcHSK protein to chloroplasts and to the cytosol. Both 
approaches resulted in up to 11 times increased total HSK enzyme activity. 
Transgenic plants exhibited reduced homoserine levels while met and thr did not 
accumulate significantly. However, the precursor cysteine and upstream 
intermediates of met such as cystathionine and homocysteine did indicating an 
accelerated carbon flow towards the end products. Coincidently, plants with 
elevated cytosolic levels of EcHSK exhibited a reduction in transcript levels of 
the endogenous HSK, as well as of threonine synthase (TS), cystathionine 
beta-lyase (CbL), and met synthase (MS). In all plants, cystathionine 
gamma-synthase (CgS) expression remained relatively unchanged from wild type 
levels, while S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS) expression increased. 
Feeding studies with externally supplied homoserine fostered the synthesis of 
met and thr but the regulation of synthesis of both amino acids retained the 
wild type regulation pattern. The results indicate that excess of plastidial 
localised HSK activity does not influence the de novo synthesis of met and thr. 
However, expression of HSK in the cytosol resulted in the down-regulation of 
gene expression of pathway genes probably mediated via OPHS. We integrated these 
data in a novel working model describing the regulatory mechanism of met and thr 
homeostasis.

Sulfonate-sulfur metabolism and its regulation in Escherichia coli.

In the absence of sulfate and cysteine, Escherichia coli can use aliphatic 
sulfonates as a source of sulfur for growth. Starvation for sulfate leads to the 
expression of the tauABCD and ssuEADCB genes. Each of these gene clusters 
encodes an ABC-type transport system required for uptake of aliphatic sulfonates 
and a desulfonation enzyme. The TauD protein is an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent 
dioxygenase that preferentially liberates sulfite from taurine 
(2-aminoethanesulfonic acid). SsuD is a monooxygenase that catalyzes the 
oxygenolytic desulfonation of a range of aliphatic sulfonates other than 
taurine. Its cosubstrate is FMNH2, which is provided by SsuE, an 
NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase. In contrast to many other bacteria, E. coli is 
unable to grow with arylsulfonates or with sulfate esters as sulfur source. The 
tau and ssu systems thus provide all genes for the utilization of known 
organosulfur sources by this organism, except the as yet unidentified gene(s) 
that enable some E. coli strains to grow with methanesulfonate or cysteate as a 
sulfur source. Expression of the tau and ssu genes requires the LysR-type 
transcriptional regulatory proteins CysB and Cbl. Synthesis of Cbl itself is 
under control of the CysB protein, and the CysB protein may therefore be 
regarded as the master regulator for sulfur assimilation in E. coli, while the 
Cbl protein functions as an accessory element specific for utilization of sulfur 
from organosulfur sources.

The three-dimensional structure of cystathionine beta-lyase from Arabidopsis and 
its substrate specificity.

The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL) 
catalyzes the penultimate step in the de novo biosynthesis of Met in microbes 
and plants. Absence of CBL in higher organisms makes it an important target for 
the development of antibiotics and herbicides. The three-dimensional structure 
of cystathionine beta-lyase from Arabidopsis was determined by Patterson search 
techniques, using the structure of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cystathionine 
gamma-synthase as starting point. At a resolution of 2.3 A, the model was 
refined to a final crystallographic R-factor of 24.9%. The overall structure is 
very similar to other pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes of the 
gamma-family. Exchange of a few critical residues within the active site causes 
the different substrate preferences between Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis 
CBL. Loss of interactions at the alpha-carboxyl site is the reason for the 
poorer substrate binding of Arabidopsis CBL. In addition, the binding pocket of 
Arabidopsis CBL is larger than that of E. coli CBL, explaining the similar 
binding of L-cystathionine and L-djenkolate in Arabidopsis CBL in contrast to E. 
coli CBL, where the substrate binding site is optimized for the natural 
substrate cystathionine.

The Escherichia coli ssuEADCB gene cluster is required for the utilization of 
sulfur from aliphatic sulfonates and is regulated by the transcriptional 
activator Cbl.

The growth properties of an Escherichia coli strain carrying a chromosomal 
deletion of the ssuEADCB genes (formerly designated ycbPONME) indicated that the 
products of this gene cluster are required for the utilization of sulfur from 
aliphatic sulfonates. Sequence similarity searches indicated that the proteins 
encoded by ssuA, ssuB, and ssuC are likely to constitute an ABC type transport 
system, whereas ssuD and ssuE encode an FMNH(2)-dependent monooxygenase and an 
NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase, respectively (Eichhorn, E., van der Ploeg, J. 
R., and Leisinger, T. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 26639-26646). Synthesis of 
beta-galactosidase from a transcriptional chromosomal ssuE'-lacZ fusion was 
repressed by sulfate or cystine and depended on the presence of a functional cbl 
gene, which encodes a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. Electrophoretic 
mobility shift assays with the ssu promoter region and measurements of 
beta-galactosidase from plasmid-encoded ssuE'-'lacZ fusions showed that full 
expression of the ssu operon required the presence of a Cbl-binding site 
upstream of the -35 region. CysB, the LysR transcriptional regulator for the cys 
genes, was not required for expression of a chromosomal ssuE'-lacZ fusion 
although the ssu promoter region contained three CysB-binding sites. Integration 
host factor could also occupy three binding sites in the ssu promoter region but 
had no influence on expression of a chromosomal ssuE'-lacZ fusion.

The transsulfuration enzyme cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS) catalyses the 
pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent gamma-replacement of 
O-succinyl-L-homoserine and L-cysteine, yielding L-cystathionine. The crystal 
structure of the Escherichia coli enzyme has been solved by molecular 
replacement with the known structure of cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL), and 
refined at 1.5 A resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.0%. The enzyme 
crystallizes as an alpha4 tetramer with the subunits related by 
non-crystallographic 222 symmetry. The spatial fold of the subunits, with three 
functionally distinct domains and their quaternary arrangement, is similar to 
that of CBL. Previously proposed reaction mechanisms for CGS can be checked 
against the structural model, allowing interpretation of the catalytic and 
substrate-binding functions of individual active site residues. Enzyme-substrate 
models pinpoint specific residues responsible for the substrate specificity, in 
agreement with structural comparisons with CBL. Both steric and electrostatic 
designs of the active site seem to achieve proper substrate selection and 
productive orientation. Amino acid sequence and structural alignments of CGS and 
CBL suggest that differences in the substrate-binding characteristics are 
responsible for the different reaction chemistries. Because CGS catalyses the 
only known PLP-dependent replacement reaction at Cgamma of certain amino acids, 
the results will help in our understanding of the chemical versatility of PLP.

Slow-binding inhibition of Escherichia coli cystathionine beta-lyase by 
L-aminoethoxyvinylglycine: a kinetic and X-ray study.

Klopferspitz 18a, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.

The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL) was 
previously found to be inhibited by the natural toxins rhizobitoxine and 
l-aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG). The present study characterizes the interaction 
of Escherichia coli CBL with AVG and methoxyvinylglycine (MVG) by a combination 
of kinetic methods and X-ray crystallography. Upon AVG treatment, 
time-dependent, slow-binding inhibition [Morrison, J. F. (1982) Trends Biochem. 
Sci. 7, 102-105] was observed due to the generation of a long-lived, slowly 
dissociating enzyme-inhibitor complex. Kinetic analysis revealed a one-step 
inhibition mechanism (CBL + AVG --> CBLAVG, Ki = 1.1 +/- 0.3 microM) with an 
association rate constant (k1) of 336 +/- 40 M-1 s-1. This value is several 
orders of magnitude lower than typical bimolecular rate constants of ES 
formation, suggesting that additional steps occur before formation of the first 
detectable CBLAVG complex. Loss of activity is paralleled by the conversion of 
the pyridoxaldimine 426 nm chromophore to a 341 nm-absorbing species. On the 
basis of the recently solved structure of native CBL [Clausen, T., et al. (1996) 
J. Mol. Biol. 262, 202-224], it was possible to elucidate the X-ray structure of 
the CBLAVG complex and to refine it to an R-factor of 16.4% at 2.2 A resolution. 
The refined structure reveals the geometry of the bound inhibitor and its 
interactions with residues in the active site of CBL. Both the X-ray structure 
and the absorbance spectrum of the CBLAVG complex are compatible with a ketimine 
as the reaction product. Thus, the inhibitor seems to bind in a similar way to 
CBL as the substrate, but after alpha-proton abstraction, the reaction proceeds 
in a CBL nontypical manner, i.e. protonation of PLP-C4', resulting in the 
"dead-end" ketimine PLP derivative. The CBLAVG structure furthermore suggests a 
binding mode for rhizobitoxine and explains the failure of MVG to inhibit CBL.

Cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL) is a member of the gamma-family of 
pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes (Alexander et al., 1994) that 
cleave C(beta,gamma)-S bonds of a broad variety of substrates. Recently, we 
reported the X-ray crystal structures of CBL and the CBL-trifluoroalanine 
inactivation complex at 1.83 A and 2.3 A resolution, respectively. The 
structures explicitly reveal the cofactor and substrate binding pockets. 
Spectral analysis of substrate turnover indicates a change of hydrophobicity in 
the microenvironment of the aldimine bond. In combination with further 
spectroscopic data, crystallographic evidence permits the formulation of a 
likely reaction mechanism.

Crystal structure of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate dependent cystathionine

Cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL) is a member of the gamma-family of PLP-dependent 
enzymes, that cleaves C beta-S bonds of a broad variety of substrates. The 
crystal structure of CBL from E. coli has been solved using MIR phases in 
combination with density modification. The structure has been refined to an 
R-factor of 15.2% at 1.83 A resolution using synchroton radiation diffraction 
data. The asymmetric unit of the crystal cell (space group C222(1)) contains two 
monomers related by 2-fold symmetry. A homotetramer with 222 symmetry is built 
up by crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry. Each monomer of CBL 
can be described in terms of three spatially and functionally different domains. 
The N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 60) consists of three alpha-helices and one 
beta-strand. It contributes to tetramer formation and is part of the active site 
of the adjacent subunit. The second domain (residues 61 to 256) harbors PLP and 
has an alpha/beta-structure with a seven-stranded beta-sheet as the central 
part. The remaining C-terminal domain (residues 257 to 395), connected by a long 
alpha-helix to the PLP-binding domain, consists of four helices packed on the 
solvent-accessible side of an antiparallel four-stranded beta-sheet. The fold of 
the C-terminal and the PLP-binding domain and the location of the active site 
are similar to aminotransferases. Most of the residues in the active site are 
strongly conserved among the enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway. 
Additionally, CBL is homologous to the mal gamma gene product indicating an 
evolutionary relationship between alpha and gamma-family of PLP-dependent 
enzymes. The structure of the beta, beta, beta-trifluoroalanine inactivated CBL 
has been refined at 2.3 A resolution to an R-factor of 16.2%. It suggests that 
Lys210, the PLP-binding residue, mediates the proton transfer between C alpha 
and S gamma.

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains of serogroup 0118 are the 
most prevalent group among STEC strains in diarrheic calves in Germany (L. H. 
Wieler, Ph.D. thesis, University of Giessen, 1997). To define their virulence 
properties, 42 0118 (0118:H16 [n = 38] and 0118:H- [n = 4]) strains were 
characterized. The strains displayed three different Stx combinations (Stx1 [36 
of 42], Stx1 and Stx2 [2 of 42], and Stx2 [4 of 42]). A total of 41 strains 
(97.6%) harbored a large virulence-associated plasmid containing hlyEHEC (hly 
from enterohemorrhagic E. coli). The strains' adhesive properties varied in 
relation to the eukaryotic cells tested. Only 28 of 42 strains (66.7%) showed 
localized adhesion (LA) in the human HEp-2 cell line. In contrast, in bovine 
fetal calf lung (FCL) cells, the number of LA-positive strains was much higher 
(37 of 42 [88.1%]). The locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) was detected in 41 
strains (97.6%). However, not all LEE-positive strains reacted positively in the 
fluorescence actin-staining (FAS) test, which indicated the attaching and 
effacing (AE) lesion. In HEp-2 cells, only 22 strains (52.4%) were FAS positive, 
while in FCL cells, the number of FAS-positive strains was significantly higher 
(38 of 42 [90.5%; P < 0.001]). In conclusion, the vast majority of the 0118 STEC 
strains from calves (41 of 42 [97.6%]) have a high virulence potential (stx, 
hlyEHEC, and LEE). This virulence potential and the high prevalence of STEC 0118 
strains in calves suggest that these strains could be a major health threat for 
humans in the future. In addition, the poor association between results of the 
geno- and phenotypical tests to screen for the AE ability of STEC strains calls 
the diagnostic value of the FAS test into question.

Due to their high enzymatic activity, the sugar-non-specific endonucleases from 
Serratia marcescens and Anabaena can be used for a number of applications, such 
as the removal of contaminating genetic material from biological preparations, 
footprinting studies, and the determination of nucleic acids in biochemical 
samples. These methods would benefit from immobilized nucleases. For this 
purpose, a single cysteine residue was added at the N-terminus of the Serratia 
and Anabaena nucleases and subsequently modified with a maleimide-biotin 
conjugate. Alternatively, a biotin acceptor domain was fused to the Anabaena 
nuclease, allowing biotinylation during expression in E. coli without a further 
chemical step. The attachment of biotin-modified nucleases to 
streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads and to streptavidin-coated surface 
plasmon resonance sensor chips (to study interactions with substrate and 
inhibitor) worked well when aggregates present in the protein preparations were 
removed by ultrafiltration. These methods should be of general use for similar 
enzyme systems.

The glycan repeats of the surface layer glycoprotein of Aneurinibacillus 
thermoaerophilus L420-91T contain d-rhamnose and 
3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose, both of which are also constituents of 
lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative plant and human pathogenic bacteria. The 
two genes required for biosynthesis of the nucleotide-activated precursor 
GDP-d-rhamnose, gmd and rmd, were cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in 
Escherichia coli. The corresponding enzymes Gmd and Rmd were purified to 
homogeneity, and functional studies were performed. GDP-d-mannose dehydratase 
(Gmd) converted GDP-d-mannose to GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose, with NADP+ as 
cofactor. The reductase Rmd catalyzed the second step in the pathway, namely the 
reduction of the keto-intermediate to the final product GDP-d-rhamnose using 
both NADH and NADPH as hydride donor. The elution behavior of the intermediate 
and end product was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to identify the structure of the final 
product of the reaction sequence as GDP-alpha-d-rhamnose. This is the first 
characterization of a GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase. In addition, Gmd 
has been shown to be a bifunctional enzyme with both dehydratase and reductase 
activities. So far, no enzyme catalyzing these two types of reactions has been 
identified. Both Gmd and Rmd are members of the SDR (short chain 
dehydrogenase/reductase) protein family.

The RcsAB box. Characterization of a new operator essential for the regulation

The interaction of the two transcriptional regulators RcsA and RcsB with a 
specific operator is a common mechanism in the activation of capsule 
biosynthesis in enteric bacteria. We describe RcsAB binding sites in the wza 
promoter of the operon for colanic acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli K-12, 
in the galF promoter of the operon for K2 antigen biosynthesis in Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, and in the tviA (vipR) promoter of the operon for Vi antigen 
biosynthesis in Salmonella typhi. We further show the interaction of RcsAB with 
the rcsA promoters of various species, indicating that rcsA autoregulation also 
depends on the presence of both proteins. The compilation of all identified 
RcsAB binding sites revealed the conserved core sequence TaAGaatatTCctA, which 
we propose to be termed RcsAB box. The RcsAB box is also part of Bordetella 
pertussis BvgA binding sites and may represent a more distributed recognition 
motif within the LuxR superfamily of transcriptional regulators. The RcsAB box 
is essential for the induction of Rcs-regulated promoters. Site-specific 
mutations of conserved nucleotides in the RcsAB boxes of the E. coli wza and 
rcsA promoters resulted in an exopolysaccharide-negative phenotype and in the 
reduction of reporter gene expression.

The Sinorhizobium meliloti nlpD gene consists of 1,539 nucleotides and codes for 
512 amino acids. Expression of the nlpD gene as a histidine-tagged protein in 
Escherichia coli resulted in the production of a 57-kDa protein. The deduced 
polypeptide sequence of NlpD contains one unusual hexamer repeat (KVQRGQ), one 
tetramer (TVTV) and two direct and inverted trimer repeats (KAA, AAK). The 
N-terminal amino acid residues displayed similarity with signal peptides of 
secreted bacterial lipoproteins. Mutations of the S. meliloti nlpD gene caused 
decreased survival of cells in the stationary phase.

The nonmevalonate isoprenoid pathway is an established target for antiinfective 
drug development. This paper describes high-throughput methods for the screening 
of 2C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase (IspC protein), 
4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase (IspD protein), 
4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (IspE protein), and 
2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF protein) against 
large compound libraries. The assays use up to three auxiliary enzymes. They are 
all monitored photometrically at 340 nm and are robust as documented by 
Z-factors of >or=0.86. 13C NMR assays designed for hit verification via direct 
detection of the primary reaction product are also described. Enzyme-assisted 
methods for the preparation, on a multigram scale, of isoprenoid biosynthesis 
intermediates required as substrates for these assays are reported. Notably, 
these methods enable the introduction of single or multiple 13C labels as 
required for NMR-monitored assays. The preparation of 
4-diphosphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2-phosphate in multigram 
quantities is described for the first time.

Isoprenoids are biosynthesized from isopentenyl diphosphate and the isomeric 
dimethylallyl diphosphate via the mevalonate pathway or a mevalonate-independent 
pathway that was identified during the last decade. The non-mevalonate pathway 
is present in many bacteria, some algae and in certain protozoa such as the 
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and in the plastids of higher plants, but 
not in mammals and archaea. Therefore, these enzymes have been recognised as 
promising drug targets. We report the crystal structure of Escherichia coli 2C- 
methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF), which converts 
4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2-phosphate into 
2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate and CMP in a Mg-dependent reaction. 
The protein forms homotrimers that tightly bind one zinc ion per subunit at the 
active site, which helps to position the substrate for direct attack of the 
2-phosphate group on the beta-phosphate.

The putative catalytic domain of an open reading frame from Plasmodium 
falciparum with similarity to the ispF gene of Escherichia coli specifying 
2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase was expressed in a 
recombinant E. coli strain. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity 
and was found to catalyze the formation of 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 
2,4-cyclodiphosphate from 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2-phosphate 
at a rate of 4.3 micromol x mg(-1) x min(-1). At lower rates, the recombinant 
protein catalyzes the formation of 2-phospho-2C-methyl-D-erythritol 
3,4-cyclophosphate from 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2-phosphate 
and the formation of 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 3,4-cyclophosphate from 
4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol. Divalent metal ions such as magnesium 
or manganese are required for catalytic activity. The enzyme has a pH optimum at 
pH 7.0. Recombinant expression of the full-length open reading frame afforded 
insoluble protein that could not be folded in vitro. The enzyme is a potential 
target for antimalarial drugs directed at the nonmevalonate pathway of 
isoprenoid biosynthesis.

In many microorganisms, the putative orthologs of the Escherichia coli ygbB gene 
are tightly linked or fused to putative orthologs of ygbP, which has been shown 
earlier to be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. The ygbB gene of E. coli was 
expressed in a recombinant E. coli strain and was shown to direct the synthesis 
of a soluble, 17-kDa polypeptide. The recombinant protein was found to convert 
4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2-phosphate into 
2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate and CMP. The structure of the 
reaction product was established by NMR spectroscopy using (13)C-labeled 
substrate samples. The enzyme-catalyzed reaction requires Mn(2+) or Mg(2+) but 
no other cofactors. Radioactivity from [2-(14)C]2C-methyl-D-erythritol 
2,4-cyclodiphosphate was diverted efficiently to carotenoids by isolated 
chromoplasts from Capsicum annuum and, thus, was established as an intermediate 
in the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. YgbB protein 
also was found to convert 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol into 
2C-methyl-D-erythritol 3,4-cyclophosphate. This compound does not serve as 
substrate for the formation of carotenoids by isolated chromoplasts and is 
assumed to be an in vitro product without metabolic relevance.

2-C-methylerythritol 4-phosphate has been established recently as an 
intermediate of the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway used for biosynthesis of 
terpenoids in plants and in many microorganisms. We show that an enzyme isolated 
from cell extract of Escherichia coli converts 2-C-methylerythritol 4-phosphate 
into 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol by reaction with CTP. The enzyme is 
specified by the hitherto unannotated ORF ygbP of E. coli. The cognate protein 
was obtained in pure form from a recombinant hyperexpression strain of E. coli 
harboring a plasmid with the ygbP gene under the control of a T5 promoter and 
lac operator. By using the recombinant enzyme, 
4-diphosphocytidyl-[2-(14)C]2-C-methylerythritol was prepared from 
[2-(14)C]2-C-methylerythritol 4-phosphate. The radiolabeled 
4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol was shown to be efficiently incorporated 
into carotenoids by isolated chromoplasts of Capsicum annuum. The E. coli ygbP 
gene appears to be part of a small operon also comprising the unannotated ygbB 
gene. Genes with similarity to ygbP and ygbB are present in the genomes of many 
microorganisms, and their occurrence appears to be correlated with that of the 
deoxyxylulose pathway of terpenoid biosynthesis. Moreover, several 
microorganisms have genes specifying putative fusion proteins with ygbP and ygbB 
domains, suggesting that both the YgbP protein and the YgbB protein are involved 
in the deoxyxylulose pathway. A gene from Arabidopsis thaliana with similarity 
to ygbP carries a putative plastid import sequence, which is well in line with 
the assumed localization of the deoxyxylulose pathway in the plastid compartment 
of plants.

Enzymes of the nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis are attractive 
targets for the development of herbicides and drugs against infectious diseases. 
While this pathway is essential for many pathogens and plants, mammals do not 
depend on it for the synthesis of isoprenoids. IspD, the third enzyme of the 
nonmevalonate pathway, is unique in that it has an allosteric regulatory site. 
We elucidated the binding mode of phenylisoxazoles, a new class of allosteric 
inhibitors. Allosteric inhibition is effected by large conformational changes of 
a loop region proximal to the active site. We investigated the different roles 
of residues in this loop by mutation studies and identified repulsive 
interactions with Asp291 and Asp292 to be responsible for inhibition. 
Crystallographic data and the response of mutant enzymes to three different 
classes of allosteric inhibitors provide an in-depth understanding of the 
allosteric mechanism. The obtained mutant enzymes show selective resistance to 
allosteric inhibitors and provide conceptually valuable information for future 
engineering of herbicide-resistant crops. We found that the isoprenoid 
precursors IPP and DMAPP are natural inhibitors of Arabidopsis thaliana IspD; 
however, they do not seem to bind to the allosteric site.

The enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis are 
attractive targets for the development of novel drugs against malaria and 
tuberculosis. This pathway is used exclusively by the corresponding pathogens, 
but not by humans. A series of water-soluble, cytidine-based inhibitors that 
were originally designed for the fourth enzyme in the pathway, IspD, were shown 
to inhibit the subsequent enzyme, the kinase IspE (from Escherichia coli). The 
binding mode of the inhibitors was verified by co-crystal structure analysis, 
using Aquifex aeolicus IspE. The crystal structures represent the first reported 
example of a co-crystal structure of IspE with a synthetic ligand and confirmed 
that ligand binding affinity originates mainly from the interactions of the 
nucleobase moiety in the cytidine binding pocket of the enzyme. In contrast, the 
appended benzimidazole moieties of the ligands adopt various orientations in the 
active site and establish only poor intermolecular contacts with the protein. 
Defined binding sites for sulfate ions and glycerol molecules, components in the 
crystallization buffer, near the well-conserved ATP-binding Gly-rich loop of 
IspE were observed. The crystal structures of A. aeolicus IspE nicely complement 
the one from E. coli IspE for use in structure-based design, namely by providing 
invaluable structural information for the design of inhibitors targeting IspE 
from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. Similar to the 
enzymes from these pathogens, A. aeolicus IspE directs the OH group of a 
tyrosine residue into a pocket in the active site. In the E. coli enzyme, on the 
other hand, this pocket is lined by phenylalanine and has a more pronounced 
hydrophobic character.

A hypothetical gene with similarity to the ispD gene of Escherichia coli was 
cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA. The ORF of 909 bp specifies a protein of 
302 amino acid residues. The cognate chromosomal gene consists of 2,071 bp and

acid residues 76-302 was expressed in a recombinant E. coli strain. The protein 
was purified to homogeneity and was shown to catalyze the formation of 
4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol from 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 
4-phosphate with a specific activity of 67 micromol small middle dotmin(-1)

The nucleotide second messenger c-di-GMP nearly ubiquitously promotes bacterial 
biofilm formation, with enzymes that synthesize and degrade c-di-GMP being 
controlled by diverse N-terminal sensor domains. Here, we describe a novel class 
of widely occurring c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases (PDE) that feature a periplasmic 
"CSS domain" with two highly conserved cysteines that is flanked by two 
transmembrane regions (TM1 and TM2) and followed by a cytoplasmic EAL domain 
with PDE activity. Using PdeC, one of the five CSS domain PDEs of Escherichia 
coli K-12, we show that DsbA/DsbB-promoted disulfide bond formation in the CSS 
domain reduces PDE activity. By contrast, the free thiol form is enzymatically 
highly active, with the TM2 region promoting dimerization. Moreover, this form 
is processed by periplasmic proteases DegP and DegQ, yielding a highly active 
TM2 + EAL fragment that is slowly removed by further proteolysis. Similar redox 
control and proteolysis was also observed for a second CSS domain PDE, PdeB. At 
the physiological level, CSS domain PDEs modulate production and supracellular 
architecture of extracellular matrix polymers in the deeper layers of mature 
E. coli biofilms.

Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a global transcription regulator that is 
ubiquitous to Gram-negative bacteria and regulates diverse biological processes, 
including iron uptake, cellular metabolism, stress response, and production of 
virulence determinants. As a result, for many pathogenic bacteria, Fur plays a 
crucial role in the course of infection and disease development. In this study, 
the fur gene was cloned from a pathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens strain, TSS, 
isolated from diseased Japanese flounder cultured in a local farm. TSS Fur can 
partially complement the defective phenotype of an Escherichia coli fur mutant. 
A TSS fur null mutant, TFM, was constructed. Compared to TSS, TFM exhibits 
reduced growth ability, aberrant production of outer membrane proteins, 
decreased resistance against host serum bactericidal activity, impaired ability 
to disseminate in host blood and tissues, and drastic attenuation in overall 
bacterial virulence in a Japanese flounder infection model. When used as a live 
vaccine administered via the injection, immersion, and oral routes, TFM affords 
high levels of protection upon Japanese flounder against not only P. fluorescens 
infection but also Aeromonas hydrophila infection. Furthermore, a plasmid, pJAQ, 
was constructed, which expresses the coding element of the Vibrio harveyi 
antigen AgaV-DegQ. TFM harboring pJAQ can secret AgaV-DegQ into the 
extracellular milieu. Vaccination of Japanese flounder with live TFM/pJAQ 
elicited strong immunoprotection against both V. harveyi and A. hydrophila 
infections.

In the framework of the international project aimed at the sequencing of the 
Bacillus subtilis genome, five DNA fragments in the region between rrnB (275 
degrees) and pai (284 degrees) were cloned by inverse and combinatorial 
long-range PCR and their nucleotide sequences were determined and analysed. 
Together these sequences constituted a contig of 62229 bp. On the basis of the 
position of Not1 and Stil restriction sites, the orientation and order of known 
genetic markers was determined to be pai (284 degrees)-degQ comQ comP comAA 
comAB-pbpD-kapB kinB patB-mcpB tipA mcpA tipB-rrnB (275 degrees). Fifty-four 
ORFs were detected. Thirteen of these coincided with known B. subtilis genes, 
and 41 new ORFs were found. Of the predicted new gene products, 12 showed no 
significant similarity to other known proteins, whereas ten showed strong 
similarity to proteins of other organisms with unknown function. Nineteen 
predicted proteins showed strong similarity to known proteins of other 
organisms, for instance a Na+/H+ antiporter system of Bacillus alcalophilus, a 
sugar transport system found in Mycoplasma genitalium, NADH-dependent butanol 
dehydrogenase of Clostridium acetobutylicum, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase A of 
B, subtilis, exo-1,4-alpha-glucosidase activity of Bacillus stearothermophilus 
and L-rhamnose isomerase of Escherichia coli.

A new gene locus of Bordetella pertussis defines a novel family of prokaryotic 
transcriptional accessory proteins.

Recently, a novel type of regulatory mutation causing differential effects on 
the expression of virulence genes due to a slight overexpression of the RNA 
polymerase alpha subunit (RpoA) was found in Bordetella pertussis (N. H. 
Carbonetti, T. M. Fuchs, A. A. Patamawenu, T. J. Irish, H. Deppisch, and R. 
Gross, J. Bacteriol. 176:7267-7273, 1994). To gather information on the 
molecular events behind this phenomenon, we isolated suppressor mutants of the 
RpoA-overexpressing strains after random mutagenesis. Genetic characterization 
of these suppressor strains revealed the existence of at least three distinct 
groups of dominant alleles. Mutations occurred either in the rpoA locus itself, 
in the bvg locus, or in unknown gene loci. One mutant of the latter group was 
further characterized. By the introduction of a cosmid library containing 
genomic B. pertussis DNA into this suppressor strain, we isolated a cosmid which 
suppressed the phenotype of the suppressor strain, thus restoring the negative 
effect on transcription of the ptx and cya toxin genes. Mutagenesis of the 
cosmid with Tn5 led to the identification of the gene locus responsible for this 
phenomenon. Its DNA sequence revealed the presence of an open reading frame 
(ORF) consisting of 2,373 bp coding for a hypothetical 86-kDa protein with 
extensive sequence similarities to ORFs with not yet identified functions of 
Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The new 
gene, termed tex, for toxin expression, seems to be an essential factor for B. 
pertussis, as it cannot be deleted from the bacterial chromosome. All members of 
this new protein family show significant sequence similarities with the mannitol 
repressor protein MtlR and with the presumptive RNA-binding domains of the Pnp 
and ribosomal S1 proteins of E. coli in their N- and C-terminal parts, 
respectively. These sequence similarities and the fact that the tex gene was 
isolated by virtue of its effects on gene expression in B. pertussis indicate 
that the members of this new protein family may play an important role in the 
transcription machinery of prokaryotic organisms.

The rpoA gene coding for the alpha-subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
located on the DNA of Zea mays chloroplasts has been characterized with respect 
to its position on the chloroplast genome and its nucleotide sequence. The amino 
acid sequence derived for a 39 Kd polypeptide shows strong homology with 
sequences derived from the rpoA genes of other chloroplast species and with the 
amino acid sequence of the alpha-subunit from E. coli RNA polymerase. 
Transcripts of the rpoA gene were identified by Northern hybridization and 
characterized by S1 mapping using total RNA isolated from maize chloroplasts. 
Antibodies raised against a synthetic C-terminal heptapeptide show cross 
reactivity with a 39 Kd polypeptide contained in the stroma fraction of maize 
chloroplasts. It is concluded that the rpoA gene is a functional gene and that 
therefore, at least the alpha-subunit of plastidic RNA polymerase, is expressed 
in chloroplasts.

The 30S ribosomal subunits from Bacillus stearothermophilus were cross-linked 
under native conditions with the bifunctional reagent diepoxybutane. The 
dominant protein-protein cross-link in the 30S ribosomal subunit between 
proteins S13 and S19 [Brockmöller, J., & Kamp, R.M. (1986) Biol. Chem. 
Hoppe-Seyler 367, 925-935] was isolated on a preparative scale. The presence of 
a single cross-link site between cysteine-83 of protein S13 and histidine-68 of 
protein S19 was established by microsequence analysis of isolated cross-linked 
peptides. This cross-link site was further confirmed by different analytical 
methods including fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the cross-linked 
peptide. The cross-linking site is located in the highly conserved C-terminal 
regions of proteins S13 and S19. In addition, the complete amino acid sequence 
of protein S13 from B. stearothermophilus is determined. Sequence comparison 
with the homologous Escherichia coli protein S13 revealed 58% identical amino 
acid residues.

Identification of a cross-link in the Escherichia coli ribosomal protein pair

Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits and 70 S ribosomes were treated with 
the bifunctional reagent diepoxybutane, acting as a cross-linker. One major 
cross-linked protein pair in the 30 S subunit was generated in relatively high 
yields. This cross-link was shown to consist of ribosomal proteins S13 and S19. 
Purification of this complex was achieved by a series of conventional and/or 
high pressure liquid chromatography techniques allowing its isolation in 
milligram quantities. To reveal the exact position of the two amino acids 
involved in the cross-link formation, the purified protein pair S13-S19 was 
subjected to several enzymatic fragmentations, and the resulting peptides were 
characterized by sequence analysis, amino acid analysis, and fast atom 
bombardment mass spectrometry. After isolation of the cross-linked peptides, 
Cys84 in protein S13 and His68 in S19 could be unequivocally identified as the 
amino acids cross-linked by the bifunctional reagent. This result demonstrates 
that, despite neutron scattering data which place the centers of mass of S13 and 
S19 85 A apart, at least these regions of the two proteins are located within a 
4-A distance in the ribosomal particle.

The heterotrimeric SecYEG complex cooperates with YidC to facilitate membrane 
protein insertion by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that YidC contacts the 
interior of the SecY channel resulting in a ligand-activated and 
voltage-dependent complex with distinct ion channel characteristics. The SecYEG 
pore diameter decreases from 8 Å to only 5 Å for the YidC-SecYEG pore, 
indicating a reduction in channel cross-section by YidC intercalation. In the 
presence of a substrate, YidC relocates to the rim of the pore as indicated by 
increased pore diameter and loss of YidC crosslinks to the channel interior. 
Changing the surface charge of the pore by incorporating YidC into the channel 
wall increases the anion selectivity, and the accompanying change in wall 
hydrophobicity is liable to alter the partition of helices from the pore into 
the membrane. This could explain how the exit of transmembrane domains from the 
SecY channel is facilitated by YidC.

The Sec translocon constitutes a ubiquitous protein transport channel that 
consists in bacteria of the three core components: SecY, SecE, and SecG. 
Additional proteins interact with SecYEG during different stages of protein 
transport. During targeting, SecYEG interacts with SecA, the SRP receptor, or 
the ribosome. Protein transport into or across the membrane is then facilitated 
by the interaction of SecYEG with YidC and the SecDFYajC complex. During protein 
transport, SecYEG is likely to interact also with the protein quality control 
machinery, but details about this interaction are missing. By in vivo and in 
vitro site-directed cross-linking, we show here that the periplasmic chaperone 
PpiD is located in front of the lateral gate of SecY, through which 
transmembrane domains exit the SecY channel. The strongest contacts were found 
to helix 2b of SecY. Blue native PAGE analyses verify the presence of a 
SecYEG-PpiD complex in native Escherichia coli membranes. The PpiD-SecY 
interaction was not influenced by the addition of SecA and only weakly 
influenced by binding of nontranslating ribosomes to SecYEG. In contrast, PpiD 
lost contact to the lateral gate of SecY during membrane protein insertion. 
These data identify PpiD as an additional and transient subunit of the bacterial 
SecYEG translocon. The data furthermore demonstrate the highly modular and 
versatile composition of the Sec translocon, which is probably essential for its 
ability to transport a wide range of substrates across membranes in bacteria and 
eukaryotes.

Most membrane proteins are co-translationally inserted into the lipid bilayer 
via the universally conserved SecY complex and they access the lipid phase 
presumably via a lateral gate in SecY. In bacteria, the lipid transfer of 
membrane proteins from the SecY channel is assisted by the SecY-associated 
protein YidC, but details on the SecY-YidC interaction are unknown. By employing 
an in vivo and in vitro site-directed cross-linking approach, we have mapped the 
SecY-YidC interface and found YidC in contact with all four transmembrane 
domains of the lateral gate. This interaction did not require the SecDFYajC 
complex and was not influenced by SecA binding to SecY. In contrast, ribosomes 
dissociated the YidC contacts to lateral gate helices 2b and 8. The major 
contact between YidC and the lateral gate was lost in the presence of ribosome 
nascent chains and new SecY-YidC contacts appeared. These data demonstrate that 
the SecY-YidC interaction is influenced by nascent-membrane-induced lateral gate 
movements.

Signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent protein targeting is a universally 
conserved process that delivers proteins to the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane 
or to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes. Crucial during targeting 
is the transfer of the ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) from SRP to the Sec 
translocon. In eukaryotes, this step is co-ordinated by the SRβ subunit of the 
SRP receptor (SR), which probably senses a vacant translocon by direct 
interaction with the translocon. Bacteria lack the SRβ subunit and how they 
co-ordinate RNC transfer is unknown. By site-directed cross-linking and 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses, we show that FtsY, the 
bacterial SRα homologue, binds to the exposed C4/C5 loops of SecY, the central 
component of the bacterial Sec translocon. The same loops serve also as binding 
sites for SecA and the ribosome. The FtsY-SecY interaction involves at least the 
A domain of FtsY, which attributes an important function to this so far 
ill-defined domain. Binding of FtsY to SecY residues, which are also used by 
SecA and the ribosome, probably allows FtsY to sense an available translocon and 
to align the incoming SRP-RNC with the protein conducting channel. Thus, the 
Escherichia coli FtsY encompasses the functions of both the eukaryotic SRα and 
SRβ subunits in one single protein.

BACKGROUND: The signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor plays a vital role in 
co-translational protein targeting, because it connects the soluble 
SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complex (SRP-RNCs) to the membrane bound Sec 
translocon. The eukaryotic SRP receptor (SR) is a heterodimeric protein complex, 
consisting of two unrelated GTPases. The SRbeta subunit is an integral membrane 
protein, which tethers the SRP-interacting SRalpha subunit permanently to the 
endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The prokaryotic SR lacks the SRbeta subunit and 
consists of only the SRalpha homologue FtsY. Strikingly, although FtsY requires 
membrane contact for functionality, cell fractionation studies have localized 
FtsY predominantly to the cytosolic fraction of Escherichia coli. So far, the 
exact function of the soluble SR in E. coli is unknown, but it has been 
suggested that, in contrast to eukaryotes, the prokaryotic SR might bind 
SRP-RNCs already in the cytosol and only then initiates membrane targeting.
RESULTS: In the current study we have determined the contribution of soluble 
FtsY to co-translational targeting in vitro and have re-analysed the 
localization of FtsY in vivo by fluorescence microscopy. Our data show that FtsY 
can bind to SRP-ribosome nascent chains (RNCs) in the absence of membranes. 
However, these soluble FtsY-SRP-RNC complexes are not efficiently targeted to 
the membrane. In contrast, we observed effective targeting of SRP-RNCs to 
membrane-bond FtsY. These data show that soluble FtsY does not contribute 
significantly to cotranslational targeting in E. coli. In agreement with this 
observation, our in vivo analyses of FtsY localization in bacterial cells by 
fluorescence microscopy revealed that the vast majority of FtsY was localized to 
the inner membrane and that soluble FtsY constituted only a negligible species 
in vivo.
CONCLUSION: The exact function of the SRP receptor (SR) in bacteria has so far 
been enigmatic. Our data show that the bacterial SR is almost exclusively 
membrane-bound in vivo, indicating that the presence of a soluble SR is probably 
an artefact of cell fractionation. Thus, co-translational targeting in bacteria 
does not involve the formation of a soluble SR-signal recognition particle 
(SRP)-ribosome nascent chain (RNC) intermediate but requires membrane contact of 
FtsY for efficient SRP-RNC recruitment.

The universally conserved SecYEG/Sec61 translocon constitutes the major 
protein-conducting channel in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and the 
endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotes. It is engaged in both 
translocating secretory proteins across the membrane as well as in integrating 
membrane proteins into the lipid phase of the membrane. In the current study we 
have detected distinct SecYEG translocon complexes in native Escherichia coli 
membranes. Blue-Native-PAGE revealed the presence of a 200-kDa SecYEG complex in 
resting membranes. When the SecA-dependent secretory protein pOmpA was trapped 
inside the SecYEG channel, a smaller SecY-containing complex of approximately 
140-kDa was observed, which probably corresponds to a monomeric SecYEG-substrate 
complex. Trapping the SRP-dependent polytopic membrane protein mannitol permease 
in the SecYEG translocon, resulted in two complexes of 250 and 600 kDa, each 
containing both SecY and the translocon-associated membrane protein YidC. The 
appearance of both complexes was correlated with the number of transmembrane 
domains that were exposed during targeting of mannitol permease to the membrane. 
These results suggest that the assembly or the stability of the bacterial SecYEG 
translocon is influenced by the substrate that needs to be transported.

Transport and membrane integration of polypeptides is carried out by specific 
protein complexes in the membranes of all living cells. The Sec transport path 
provides an essential and ubiquitous route for protein translocation. In the 
bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, the channel is formed by oligomers of a 
heterotrimeric membrane protein complex consisting of subunits SecY, SecE and 
SecG. In the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the channel is formed from the 
related Sec61 complex. Here we report the structure of the Escherichia coli 
SecYEG assembly at an in-plane resolution of 8 A. The three-dimensional map, 
calculated from two-dimensional SecYEG crystals, reveals a sandwich of two 
membranes interacting through the extensive cytoplasmic domains. Each membrane 
is composed of dimers of SecYEG. The monomeric complex contains 15 transmembrane 
helices. In the centre of the dimer we observe a 16 x 25 A cavity closed on the 
periplasmic side by two highly tilted transmembrane helices. This may represent 
the closed state of the protein-conducting channel.

catabolic, recombination, and secretory pathways.

In this study, we have characterized the in vitro binding of Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae Fur to several well-defined iron transport genes, as well as to 
additional genes involved in major catabolic, secretory, and recombination 
pathways of gonococci. The gonococcal Fur protein was recombinantly expressed in 
Escherichia coli HBMV119. Fur was isolated from inclusion bodies and partially 
purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Gonococcal Fur was found to bind to the 
promoter/operator region of a gene encoding the previously identified 
Fur-regulated periplasmic binding protein (FbpA) in a metal ion-dependent 
fashion, demonstrating that purified Fur is functional. In silico analysis of 
the partially completed gonococcal genome (FA1090) identified Fur boxes in the 
promoters of several genes, including tonB, fur, recN, secY, sodB, hemO, hmbR, 
fumC, a hypothetical gene (Fe-S homolog), and the opa family of genes. By using 
purified gonococcal Fur, we demonstrate binding to the operator regions of tonB, 
fur, recN, secY, sodB, hemO, hmbR, fumC, the Fe-S homolog gene, and the opa gene 
family as determined by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. While 
gonococcal Fur was demonstrated to bind to the promoter regions of all 11 opa 
genes (opaA through -K), we did not detect binding of purified E. coli Fur with 
8 of the 11 opa members, indicating that target DNA sequence specificities 
between these two closely related proteins exist. Furthermore, we observed 
differences in the relative strengths of binding of gonococcal Fur for these 
different genes, which most likely reflect a difference in affinity between 
gonococcal Fur and its DNA targets. This is the first report that definitively 
demonstrates the binding of gonococcal Fur to its own promoter/operator region, 
as well as to the opa family of genes that encode surface proteins. Our results 
demonstrate that the gonococcal Fur protein binds to the regulatory regions of a 
broad array of genes and indicates that the gonococcal Fur regulon is larger 
than originally proposed.

SRP-dependent co-translational targeting and SecA-dependent translocation 
analyzed as individual steps in the export of a bacterial protein.

Recently it has been recognized that the signal recognition particle (SRP) of 
Escherichia coli represents a specific targeting device for hydrophobic inner 
membrane proteins. It has remained unclear, however, whether the bacterial SRP 
functions in concert with SecA, which is required for the translocation of 
secretory proteins across the inner membrane. Here, we have analyzed a hybrid 
protein constructed by fusing the signal anchor sequence of an SRP-dependent 
inner membrane protein (MtlA) to the mature part of an exclusively 
SecA-requiring secretory protein (OmpA). We show that the signal anchor sequence 
of MtlA confers the novel properties onto nascent chains of OmpA of being 
co-translationally recognized and targeted to SecY by SRP. Once targeted to 
SecY, ribosome-associated nascent chains of the hybrid protein, however, remain 
untranslocated unless SecA is present. These results indicate that SRP and SecA 
cooperate in a sequential, non-overlapping manner in the topogenesis of those 
membrane proteins which, in addition to a signal anchor sequence, harbor a 
substantial hydrophilic domain to be translocated into the periplasm.

Dissecting the translocase and integrase functions of the Escherichia coli

Recent evidence suggests that in Escherichia coli, SecA/SecB and signal 
recognition particle (SRP) are constituents of two different pathways targeting 
secretory and inner membrane proteins to the SecYEG translocon of the plasma 
membrane. We now show that a secY mutation, which compromises a functional 
SecY-SecA interaction, does not impair the SRP-mediated integration of polytopic 
inner membrane proteins. Furthermore, under conditions in which the 
translocation of secretory proteins is strictly dependent on SecG for assisting 
SecA, the absence of SecG still allows polytopic membrane proteins to integrate 
at the wild-type level. These results indicate that SRP-dependent integration 
and SecA/SecB-mediated translocation do not only represent two independent 
protein delivery systems, but also remain mechanistically distinct processes 
even at the level of the membrane where they engage different domains of SecY 
and different components of the translocon. In addition, the experimental setup 
used here enabled us to demonstrate that SRP-dependent integration of a 
multispanning protein into membrane vesicles leads to a biologically active 
enzyme.

The phenotypic suppression of a mutation in the gene rplX for ribosomal protein

A suppressor mutation of a temperature-sensitive mutant of ribosomal protein L24 
(rplX19) was mapped close to the lon gene by genetic analysis and was shown to 
affect protease LA. The degradation and the synthesis rates of individual 
ribosomal proteins were determined. Proteins L24, L14, L15 and L27 were found to 
be degraded faster in the original rplX19 mutant than in the rplX19 mutant 
containing the suppressor mutation. Other ribosomal proteins were either weakly 
or not at all degraded in both mutants. Temperature-sensitive growth was also 
suppressed by the overproduction of mutant protein L24 from a plasmid. Our 
results suggest that (1) either free ribosomal proteins or proteins bound to 
abortive assembly precursors are highly susceptible to the lon gene product and 
(2) the mutationally altered protein L24 can still function at the nonpermissive 
growth temperature of the mutant, if it is present in sufficient amounts.

Temperature-resistant pseudorevertants of the temperature-sensitive Escherichia 
coli mutant KNS19, harboring a mutation in rplX, the gene for ribosomal protein 
L24, were isolated, cloned, and sequenced. The codon GAC for the amino acid Asp 
in the temperature-sensitive mutant corresponding to position 84 in the protein 
chain mutated either back to the wild type (Gly) or to codons for the amino 
acids Tyr and Glu. Furthermore, rplX genes from two other mutants with an 
altered protein L24 were cloned and sequenced. The mutations were localized at 
position 56 (Gly to Asp) and at position 62 (Glu to Lys) in the rplX gene. The 
latter two mutants lacked a conditional lethal phenotype. The results suggest 
that the amino acid Gly at positions 56 and 84 in the protein might be involved 
in loop formations.

Nucleotide sequences of Bacillus stearothermophilus ribosomal protein genes:

Restriction fragments from Bacillus stearothermophilus chromosomal DNA were 
cross-hybridized with the Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L2 gene rplB. A 
2-kb EcoRI fragment which showed cross-hybridization was cloned into the M13 
phage and sequenced by the dideoxy chain-terminating method. Comparison of the 
deduced amino-acid sequences with the corresponding sequences of E. coli 
ribosomal proteins showed that this fragment contains the region encoding the 
C-terminus of L2, the genes encoding S19, L22, S3 as well as the N-terminus of 
L16. Thus the organization of this gene cluster is the same as that in the S10 
operon of E. coli. The deduced sequences of proteins L22 and S3, which have not 
been determined so far, were found to have 52% or 55% amino-acid identity, 
respectively, with those of the corresponding proteins in E. coli. The deduced 
B. stearothermophilus S19 protein sequence was in accordance with the 
reinvestigated protein sequence (H. Hirano, personal communication).

The Rhizobium leguminosarum FnrN protein is functionally similar to Escherichia 
coli Fnr and promotes heterologous oxygen-dependent activation of transcription.

An open reading frame from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae strain VF39, 
previously identified and found to be similar to Escherichia coli fnr and 
Rhizobium meliloti fixK (orf240, thereafter called fnrN), was further analysed. 
Analysis of the expression of an fnrN-lacZ transcriptional fusion revealed that 
fnrN is preferentially expressed under oxygen limitation. Using R. meliloti 
fixN-lacZ fusions it was shown that the fnrN gene product only mediates 
transcriptional activation under microaerobiosis, indicating that the FnrN 
protein responds, directly or indirectly, to oxygen. Plasmids which expressed 
fnrN under the control of an E. coli promoter were able to complement an E. coli 
fnr mutant with respect to anaerobic growth on nitrate but not fumarate, and to 
promote anaerobic but not aerobic activation of the Fnr-dependent E. coli genes 
narGHJI, nirB and fdnGHI coding for nitrate reductase, NADH-dependent nitrite 
reductase and formate dehydrogenase-N, respectively. Fumarate and DMSO reductase 
activities were not induced by FnrN. The E. coli fnr gene substituted for fnrN 
in oxygen-regulated transcription of nirB- and fixN-lacZ fusions in R. 
leguminosarum. The results indicate that Fnr and FnrN are functionally very 
similar and share a common mode of oxygen-dependent transcriptional activation. 
From hybridization studies, it appeared that fnrN-like genes are present in a 
number of different R. leguminosarum strains.

Role of the Tat ransport system in nitrous oxide reductase translocation and 
cytochrome cd1 biosynthesis in Pseudomonas stutzeri.

Heikkilä MP(1), Honisch U, Wunsch P, Zumft WG.

Author information:
(1)Lehrstuhl für Mikrobiologie, Universität Karlsruhe, D-76128 Karlsruhe, 
Germany.

By transforming N2O to N2, the multicopper enzyme nitrous oxide reductase 
provides a periplasmic electron sink for a respiratory chain that is part of 
denitrification. The signal sequence of the enzyme carries the heptameric 
twin-arginine consensus motif characteristic of the Tat pathway. We have 
identified tat genes of Pseudomonas stutzeri and functionally analyzed the 
unlinked tatC and tatE loci. A tatC mutant retained N2O reductase in the 
cytoplasm in the unprocessed form and lacking the metal cofactors. This is 
contrary to viewing the Tat system as specific only for fully assembled 
proteins. A C618V exchange in the electron transfer center CuA rendered the 
enzyme largely incompetent for transport. The location of the mutation in the 
C-terminal domain of N(2)O reductase implies that the Tat system acts on a 
completely synthesized protein and is sensitive to a late structural variation 
in folding. By generating a tatE mutant and a reductase-overproducing strain, we 
show a function for TatE in N2O reductase translocation. Further, we have found 
that the Tat and Sec pathways have to cooperate to produce a functional nitrite 
reductase system. The cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase was found in the 
periplasm of the tatC mutant, suggesting export by the Sec pathway; however, the 
enzyme lacked the heme D1 macrocycle. The NirD protein as part of a complex 
required for heme D1 synthesis or processing carries a putative Tat signal 
peptide. Since NO reduction was also inhibited in the tatC mutant, the Tat 
protein translocation system is necessary in multiple ways for establishing 
anaerobic nitrite denitrification.

Base Excision Repair (BER) is considered as the most active DNA repair pathway 
in vivo, which is initiated by recognition of the nucleotide lesions and 
excision of the damaged DNA base. The genome of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 
13032 contains various DNA glycosylases encoding genes (ung, fpg/mutM, tagI, 
alkA, mutY), two AP-endonuclease encoding genes (nei and nth) and an exonuclease 
encoding gene xth. To investigate the role of these genes during DNA repair in 
C. glutamicum, mutants with deletions of one or more genes in BER pathway were 
created. After treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 
mitomycin C (MMC), zeocin and UV-light, we characterised the function of the 
different BER genes by determination of the survival capability. DNA lesions 
caused by MNNG strongly reduced survival of the tagI, mutY and alkA mutants but 
had a negligible effect on the ung and mutM mutants. The endonucleases Nth and 
Nei turned out to be essential for the repair of base modifications caused by 
MMC while UV-light and zeocin did not seem to address the BER. So far, BER in C. 
glutamicum appears to be very similar to that in E. coli.

MutY is down-regulated by oxidative stress in E. coli.

In Escherichia coli, MutM (8-oxoG DNA glycosylase/lyase or Fpg protein), MutY 
(adenine DNA glycosylase) and MutT (8-oxodGTPase) function cooperatively to 
prevent mutation due to 7, 8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a highly mutagenic 
oxidative DNA adduct. MutM activity has been demonstrated to be induced by 
oxidative stress. Its regulation is under the negative control of the global 
regulatory genes, fur, fnr and arcA. However, interestingly the presence of MutY 
increases the mutation frequency in mutT- background because of MutY removes 
adenine (A) from 8-oxoG:A which arises from the misincorporation of 8-oxoG 
against A during DNA replication. Accordingly we hypothesized that the response 
of MutY to oxidative stress is opposite to that of MutM and compared the 
regulation of MutY activity with MutM under various oxidative stimuli. Unlike 
MutM, MutY activity was reduced by oxidative stress. Its activity was reduced to 
30% of that of the control when E. coli was treated with paraquat (0.5mM) or 
H2O2 (0.1 mM) and induced under anaerobic conditions to more than twice that 
observed under aerobic conditions. The reduced mRNA level of MutY coincided with 
its reduced activity by paraquat treatment. Also, the increased activity of MutY 
in anaerobic conditions was reduced further in E. coli strains with mutations in 
fur, fnr and arcA and the maximum reduction in activity was when all mutations 
were present in combination, indicating that MutY is under the positive control 
of these regulatory genes. Therefore, the down-regulation of MutY suggests that 
there has been complementary mechanism for its mutagenic activity under special 
conditions. Moreover, the efficacy of anti-mutagenic action should be enhanced 
by the reciprocal co-regulation of MutM.

The complete amino acid sequences of ribosomal proteins L16, L23 and L33 from

were established by manual sequencing of peptides produced with several 
proteases as well as by cleavage with dilute HCl. Proteins L16, L23 and L33

13,538, 16,812 and 7620 Da, respectively. The comparison of their sequences with 
those of ribosomal proteins from other organisms revealed that L23 and L33 are 
related to eubacterial ribosomal proteins from Escherichia coli and Bacillus 
stearothermophilus, while protein L16 was found to be homologous to a eukaryotic 
ribosomal protein from yeast. These results provide information about the 
special phylogenetic position of archaebacteria.

The DNA-binding domain of the Escherichia coli DnaA protein is represented by 
the 94 C-terminal amino acids (domain 4, aa 374-467). The isolated DNA-binding 
domain acts as a functional repressor in vivo, as monitored with a mioC:lacZ 
translational fusion integrated into the chromosome of the indicator strain. In 
order to identify residues required for specific DNA binding, site-directed and 
random PCR mutagenesis were performed, using the mioC:lacZ construct for 
selection. Mutations defective in DNA binding were found all over the 
DNA-binding domain with some clustering in the basic loop region, within 
presumptive helix B and in a highly conserved region at the N-terminus of 
presumptive helix C. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis revealed different 
binding classes of mutant proteins. No or severely reduced binding activity was 
demonstrated for amino acid substitutions at positions R399, R407, Q408, H434, 
T435, T436 and A440. Altered binding specificity was found for mutations in a 12 
residue region close to the N-terminus of helix C. The defects of the classical 
temperature sensitive mutants dnaA204, dnaA205 and dnaA211 result from

Termination of the Escherichia coli asnC transcript. The DnaA protein/dnaA box 
complex blocks transcribing RNA polymerase.

Genes clockwise of oriC, the Escherichia coli replication origin 
(oriC-mioC-asnC), show anticlockwise transcription. The intergenic region 
between mioC and asnC contains both a terminator and a consensus 
DnaA-protein-binding site (dnaA box). We analysed termination in this region 
using galK expression to monitor for transcription. About 50% of the asnC 
transcripts were not terminated, and about 25% terminated at the asnC 
terminator. We found that the DnaA protein/dnaA box complex acts as a terminator 
of transcription for about 25% of the transcripts. Its efficiency could be 
increased by raising the level of DnaA protein, or it could be inactivated by 
deletion in the dnaA box or by thermal denaturation of the DnaA protein.

Transcription in the region of the replication origin, oriC, of Escherichia

Transcription from the asnC promoter was found to proceed through the 
replication origin, oriC, into the gidA gene of Escherichia coli. Between 10% 
and 20% of asnC transcripts reached oriC in vivo. Termination sites in the 
intergenic region between asnC and mioC and within mioC were determined in vivo 
and in vitro using S1 mapping. Only about 10% of the transcripts terminated at 
the asnC terminator in vivo. DnaA protein dependent termination was observed 
close to the binding site, dnaA box, for DnaA protein. In the in vitro 
replication system asnC transcripts did not reach oriC, suggesting that asnC 
transcripts are not involved in the initiation of replication, contrary to mioC 
transcripts. We suggest that oriC and mioC might have been transposed during 
evolution into an asnC regulation.

AsnC, a multifunctional regulator of genes located around the replication origin 
of Escherichia coli, oriC.

The expression of the gidA gene which is located immediately counterclockwise of 
the replication origin of Escherichia coli, oriC, was found to be negatively 
regulated by the AsnC protein in an in vitro transcription-translation system. 
This effect is not due to simple repression of transcription originating at the 
gidA promoter, because the AsnC protein did not change the level of gidA 
promoter dependent transcription as analysed by promoter-galK fusions and by S1 
mapping. From these data we conclude that the AsnC protein controls gidA gene 
expression at a post-transcriptional level. gidA is the third gene in the oriC 
region, besides asnA and asnC, whose expression is under AsnC control. However, 
the mechanisms involved are different: regulation of transcription in the case 
of asnA and asnC and post-transcriptional control of gidA. The gidA promoter was 
mapped by deletion analysis and by S1 mapping. We defined two regions that 
affect promoter activity negatively. Additional transcripts, regulated by AsnC, 
started more than 300 bp upstream of the gidA promoter and were found to enter 
the gidA region. These transcripts, originating either at the mioC and/or the 
ansC promoter traverse the replication origin.

Functionality of the dnaA protein binding site in DNA replication is 
orientation-dependent.

We analyzed the functionality of different dnaA protein binding sites by 
assaying in vitro dnaA-dependent replication of pBR322 derivatives. Single dnaA 
sites from oriC and from the mioC and dnaA gene promoters were active when 
combined with the primer generating element of pBR322 in a proper distance. 
Prereplisome assembly did not require sequences in addition to the 9-base pair 
consensus dnaA binding site. Inversion of the structurally asymmetric dnaA site 
relative to its orientation in wild type pBR322 resulted in a marked reduction 
in replication efficiency, as observed with five different dnaA sites studied. 
The direction of DNA replication was not affected.

Identification of the gene encoding transcription factor NusG of Thermus

The nusG gene of Thermus thermophilus HB8 was cloned and sequenced. It is 
located 388 bp downstream from tufB, which is followed by the genes for 
ribosomal proteins L11 and L1. No equivalent to secE preceding nusG, as in 
Escherichia coli, could be detected. The nusG gene product was overproduced in 
E. coli. A rabbit antiserum raised against the purified recombinant NusG reacted 
exclusively with one protein band of T. thermophilus crude extracts in Western 
blot (immunoblot) analyses, and no cross-reaction of the antiserum with E. coli 
NusG was observed. Recombinant NusG and the reacting T. thermophilus wild-type 
protein had identical sizes on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. T. 
thermophilus and E. coli NusG have 45% identical and 22.5% similar amino acids, 
and similarities between the two proteins are most pronounced in 
carboxy-terminal regions. The T. thermophilus nusG gene could not rescue a 
nusG-deficient E. coli mutant strain.

Sequence of the tufA gene encoding elongation factor EF-Tu from Thermus

The sequence of the tufA gene from the extreme thermophilic eubacterium Thermus 
aquaticus EP 00276 was determined. The GC content in third positions of codons 
is 89.5%, with an unusual predominance of guanosine (60.7%). The derived protein 
sequence differs from tufA- and tufB-encoded sequences for elongation factor Tu 
(EF-Tu) of Thermus thermophilus HB8, another member of the genus Thermus, in 10 
of the 405 amino acid residues. Three exchanges are located in the additional 
loop of ten amino acids (182-191). The loop, probably involved in nucleotide 
binding, is absent in EF-Tu of the mesophile Escherichia coli. Since EF-Tu from 
E. coli is quite unstable, the protein is well-suited for analyzing molecular 
changes that lead to thermostabilization. Comparison of the EF-Tu domain I from 
E. coli and Thermus strains revealed clustered amino acid exchanges in the 
C-terminal part of the first helix and in adjacent residues of the second loop 
inferred to interact with the ribosome. Most other exchanges in the guanine 
nucleotide binding domain are located in loops or nearest vicinity of loops 
suggesting their importance for thermostability. The T. aquaticus EF-Tu was 
overproduced in E. coli using the tac expression system. Identity of the 
recombinant T. aquaticus EF-Tu was verified by Western blot analysis, N-terminal 
sequencing and GDP binding assays.

The Sec translocon constitutes a ubiquitous protein transport channel that 
consists in bacteria of the three core components: SecY, SecE, and SecG. 
Additional proteins interact with SecYEG during different stages of protein 
transport. During targeting, SecYEG interacts with SecA, the SRP receptor, or 
the ribosome. Protein transport into or across the membrane is then facilitated 
by the interaction of SecYEG with YidC and the SecDFYajC complex. During protein 
transport, SecYEG is likely to interact also with the protein quality control 
machinery, but details about this interaction are missing. By in vivo and in 
vitro site-directed cross-linking, we show here that the periplasmic chaperone 
PpiD is located in front of the lateral gate of SecY, through which 
transmembrane domains exit the SecY channel. The strongest contacts were found 
to helix 2b of SecY. Blue native PAGE analyses verify the presence of a 
SecYEG-PpiD complex in native Escherichia coli membranes. The PpiD-SecY 
interaction was not influenced by the addition of SecA and only weakly 
influenced by binding of nontranslating ribosomes to SecYEG. In contrast, PpiD 
lost contact to the lateral gate of SecY during membrane protein insertion. 
These data identify PpiD as an additional and transient subunit of the bacterial 
SecYEG translocon. The data furthermore demonstrate the highly modular and 
versatile composition of the Sec translocon, which is probably essential for its 
ability to transport a wide range of substrates across membranes in bacteria and 
eukaryotes.

Most membrane proteins are co-translationally inserted into the lipid bilayer 
via the universally conserved SecY complex and they access the lipid phase 
presumably via a lateral gate in SecY. In bacteria, the lipid transfer of 
membrane proteins from the SecY channel is assisted by the SecY-associated 
protein YidC, but details on the SecY-YidC interaction are unknown. By employing 
an in vivo and in vitro site-directed cross-linking approach, we have mapped the 
SecY-YidC interface and found YidC in contact with all four transmembrane 
domains of the lateral gate. This interaction did not require the SecDFYajC 
complex and was not influenced by SecA binding to SecY. In contrast, ribosomes 
dissociated the YidC contacts to lateral gate helices 2b and 8. The major 
contact between YidC and the lateral gate was lost in the presence of ribosome 
nascent chains and new SecY-YidC contacts appeared. These data demonstrate that 
the SecY-YidC interaction is influenced by nascent-membrane-induced lateral gate 
movements.

Visualization of distinct entities of the SecYEG translocon during translocation 
and integration of bacterial proteins.

The universally conserved SecYEG/Sec61 translocon constitutes the major 
protein-conducting channel in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and the 
endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotes. It is engaged in both 
translocating secretory proteins across the membrane as well as in integrating 
membrane proteins into the lipid phase of the membrane. In the current study we 
have detected distinct SecYEG translocon complexes in native Escherichia coli 
membranes. Blue-Native-PAGE revealed the presence of a 200-kDa SecYEG complex in 
resting membranes. When the SecA-dependent secretory protein pOmpA was trapped 
inside the SecYEG channel, a smaller SecY-containing complex of approximately 
140-kDa was observed, which probably corresponds to a monomeric SecYEG-substrate 
complex. Trapping the SRP-dependent polytopic membrane protein mannitol permease 
in the SecYEG translocon, resulted in two complexes of 250 and 600 kDa, each 
containing both SecY and the translocon-associated membrane protein YidC. The 
appearance of both complexes was correlated with the number of transmembrane 
domains that were exposed during targeting of mannitol permease to the membrane. 
These results suggest that the assembly or the stability of the bacterial SecYEG 
translocon is influenced by the substrate that needs to be transported.

Transport and membrane integration of polypeptides is carried out by specific 
protein complexes in the membranes of all living cells. The Sec transport path 
provides an essential and ubiquitous route for protein translocation. In the 
bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, the channel is formed by oligomers of a 
heterotrimeric membrane protein complex consisting of subunits SecY, SecE and 
SecG. In the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the channel is formed from the 
related Sec61 complex. Here we report the structure of the Escherichia coli 
SecYEG assembly at an in-plane resolution of 8 A. The three-dimensional map, 
calculated from two-dimensional SecYEG crystals, reveals a sandwich of two 
membranes interacting through the extensive cytoplasmic domains. Each membrane 
is composed of dimers of SecYEG. The monomeric complex contains 15 transmembrane 
helices. In the centre of the dimer we observe a 16 x 25 A cavity closed on the 
periplasmic side by two highly tilted transmembrane helices. This may represent 
the closed state of the protein-conducting channel.

Chloroplast SecE: evidence for spontaneous insertion into the thylakoid

SecE, an essential component of the bacterial SecAYEG translocase, mediates 
protein translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. In the thylakoid 
membranes of chloroplasts an SecE homologue, cpSecE, has recently been 
identified. In this report we show that insertion of cpSecE does not require 
stromal extract, indicating that signal recognition particle is not involved. 
Removal of nucleoside triphosphates has apparently no effect on the integration, 
again ruling out an involvement of SRP or its partner protein, FtsY. The use of 
well-known inhibitors of the Sec- and Tat pathways, sodium azide and nigericin, 
respectively, also had no influence on membrane insertion. The data presented 
here point towards cpSecE as another passenger of a wholly spontaneous 
import/insertion pathway in the thylakoids of chloroplasts.

YidC, an assembly site for polytopic Escherichia coli membrane proteins located

Like its mitochondrial homolog Oxa1p, the inner membrane protein YidC of 
Escherichia coli is involved in the integration of membrane proteins. We have 
analyzed individual insertion steps of the polytopic E. coli membrane protein 
MtlA targeted as ribosome-nascent chain complexes to inner membrane vesicles. 
YidC can accommodate at least the first two transmembrane segments of MtlA at 
the protein lipid interface and retain them even though the length of the 
nascent chain would amply allow insertion into membrane lipids. An even longer 
insertion intermediate of MtlA is described that still has the first 
transmembrane helix bound to YidC while the third contacts SecE and YidC during 
integration. Our findings suggest that YidC forms a contiguous integration unit 
with the SecYE translocon and functions as an assembly site for polytopic 
membrane proteins mediating the formation of helix bundles prior to their 
release into the membrane lipids.

SRP-dependent co-translational targeting and SecA-dependent translocation 
analyzed as individual steps in the export of a bacterial protein.

Recently it has been recognized that the signal recognition particle (SRP) of 
Escherichia coli represents a specific targeting device for hydrophobic inner 
membrane proteins. It has remained unclear, however, whether the bacterial SRP 
functions in concert with SecA, which is required for the translocation of 
secretory proteins across the inner membrane. Here, we have analyzed a hybrid 
protein constructed by fusing the signal anchor sequence of an SRP-dependent 
inner membrane protein (MtlA) to the mature part of an exclusively 
SecA-requiring secretory protein (OmpA). We show that the signal anchor sequence 
of MtlA confers the novel properties onto nascent chains of OmpA of being 
co-translationally recognized and targeted to SecY by SRP. Once targeted to 
SecY, ribosome-associated nascent chains of the hybrid protein, however, remain 
untranslocated unless SecA is present. These results indicate that SRP and SecA 
cooperate in a sequential, non-overlapping manner in the topogenesis of those 
membrane proteins which, in addition to a signal anchor sequence, harbor a 
substantial hydrophilic domain to be translocated into the periplasm.

Recent evidence suggests that in Escherichia coli, SecA/SecB and signal 
recognition particle (SRP) are constituents of two different pathways targeting 
secretory and inner membrane proteins to the SecYEG translocon of the plasma 
membrane. We now show that a secY mutation, which compromises a functional 
SecY-SecA interaction, does not impair the SRP-mediated integration of polytopic 
inner membrane proteins. Furthermore, under conditions in which the 
translocation of secretory proteins is strictly dependent on SecG for assisting 
SecA, the absence of SecG still allows polytopic membrane proteins to integrate 
at the wild-type level. These results indicate that SRP-dependent integration 
and SecA/SecB-mediated translocation do not only represent two independent 
protein delivery systems, but also remain mechanistically distinct processes 
even at the level of the membrane where they engage different domains of SecY 
and different components of the translocon. In addition, the experimental setup 
used here enabled us to demonstrate that SRP-dependent integration of a 
multispanning protein into membrane vesicles leads to a biologically active 
enzyme.

The signal recognition particle receptor alpha subunit of the hyperthermophilic

Two adjacent genes of the acidophilic and hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon 
Acidianus ambivalens were cloned and sequenced. The 1.6 kb genomic nucleotide 
sequence under investigation consists of the 1.12 kb SRa gene encoding the 
putative signal recognition particle receptor alpha subunit (SR alpha, 42.2 kDa) 
and the 186 basepair secE gene coding for the putative secretory component secE 
subunit (6800 Da). The SR alpha protein is structured by three distinct regions: 
the N-terminal hydrophilic H-region, the following X-region and the C-terminal 
GTP-binding domain. A polyclonal anti-E. coli lacZ/A. ambivalens SR alpha 
antiserum detects a 51 kDa cell protein (p51) on immunoblots. Proteolysis of the 
recombinant SR alpha protein by Proteinase K produces a 31.6 kDa 
protease-resistant protein fragment comprising X-region and G-domain. The 
protein binds tightly to the GTP-agarose affinity matrix in a 
temperature-dependent manner. It hydrolyzes GTP readily at higher temperatures 
only in the presence of Mg2+. Point mutations (T326N) and (D329A) in the G-4 
element of A. ambivalens SR alpha G-domain diminish the GTPase activity 
significantly. In contrast, the deletion mutant protein SR alpha (delta1-92) 
lacking the hydrophilic H-region displays a higher GTP-hydrolyzing activity when 
compared to the unmodified recombinant protein. Addition of GDP greatly inhibits 
GTP hydrolysis in mutant and unmodified A. ambivalens SR alpha.

A DNA fragment containing the genes secE, nusG and rplK of Staphylococcus 
carnsosus was cloned using the Escherichia coli rplK gene as a probe. The S. 
carnosus secE homologue encodes a protein of 65 amino acid residues which is 
homologous to the carboxyl-terminal region of the E. coli SecE protein. The S. 
carnosus SecE polypeptide which, in contrast to the E. coli SecE protein, 
contains only one putative transmembrane segment, could fully replace the E. 
coli SecE protein in two different secE mutants. These results strongly suggest 
that the identified secE gene encodes an important component of the S. carnosus 
protein export apparatus.

Factor-dependent transcription termination mechanisms are poorly understood. We 
determined a series of cryo-electron microscopy structures portraying the 
hexameric adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) ρ on a pathway to terminating 
NusA/NusG-modified elongation complexes. An open ρ ring contacts NusA, NusG, and 
multiple regions of RNA polymerase, trapping and locally unwinding proximal 
upstream DNA. NusA wedges into the ρ ring, initially sequestering RNA. Upon 
deflection of distal upstream DNA over the RNA polymerase zinc-binding domain, 
NusA rotates underneath one capping ρ subunit, which subsequently captures RNA. 
After detachment of NusG and clamp opening, RNA polymerase loses its grip on the 
RNA:DNA hybrid and is inactivated. Our structural and functional analyses 
suggest that ρ, and other termination factors across life, may use analogous 
strategies to allosterically trap transcription complexes in a moribund state.

Bacterial ribosomal RNAs are synthesized by a dedicated, conserved 
transcription-elongation complex that transcribes at high rates, shields RNA 
polymerase from premature termination, and supports co-transcriptional RNA 
folding, modification, processing, and ribosomal subunit assembly by presently 
unknown mechanisms. We have determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of 
complete Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA transcription elongation complexes, 
comprising RNA polymerase; DNA; RNA bearing an N-utilization-site-like 
anti-termination element; Nus factors A, B, E, and G; inositol mono-phosphatase 
SuhB; and ribosomal protein S4. Our structures and structure-informed functional 
analyses show that fast transcription and anti-termination involve suppression 
of NusA-stabilized pausing, enhancement of NusG-mediated anti-backtracking, 
sequestration of the NusG C-terminal domain from termination factor ρ, and the ρ 
blockade. Strikingly, the factors form a composite RNA chaperone around the RNA 
polymerase RNA-exit tunnel, which supports co-transcriptional RNA folding and 
annealing of distal RNA regions. Our work reveals a polymerase/chaperone machine 
required for biosynthesis of functional ribosomes.

Bacteriophage λN protein, a model anti-termination factor, binds nascent RNA and 
host Nus factors, rendering RNA polymerase resistant to all pause and 
termination signals. A 3.7-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure and 
structure-informed functional analyses reveal a multi-pronged strategy by which 
the intrinsically unstructured λN directly modifies RNA polymerase interactions 
with the nucleic acids and subverts essential functions of NusA, NusE, and NusG 
to reprogram the transcriptional apparatus. λN repositions NusA and remodels the 
β subunit flap tip, which likely precludes folding of pause or termination RNA 
hairpins in the exit tunnel and disrupts termination-supporting interactions of 
the α subunit C-terminal domains. λN invades and traverses the RNA polymerase 
hybrid cavity, likely stabilizing the hybrid and impeding pause- or 
termination-related conformational changes of polymerase. λN also lines upstream 
DNA, seemingly reinforcing anti-backtracking and anti-swiveling by NusG. 
Moreover, λN-repositioned NusA and NusE sequester the NusG C-terminal domain, 
counteracting ρ-dependent termination. Other anti-terminators likely utilize 
similar mechanisms to enable processive transcription.

RfaH, member of the NusG/Spt5 family, activates virulence genes in Gram-negative 
pathogens. RfaH exists in two states, with its C-terminal domain (CTD) folded 
either as α-helical hairpin or β-barrel. In free RfaH, the α-helical CTD 
interacts with, and masks the RNA polymerase binding site on, the N-terminal 
domain, autoinhibiting RfaH and restricting its recruitment to opsDNA sequences. 
Upon activation, the domains separate and the CTD refolds into the β-barrel, 
which recruits a ribosome, activating translation. Using NMR spectroscopy, we 
show that only a complete ops-paused transcription elongation complex activates 
RfaH, probably via a transient encounter complex, allowing the refolded CTD to 
bind ribosomal protein S10. We also demonstrate that upon release from the 
elongation complex, the CTD transforms back into the autoinhibitory α-state, 
resetting the cycle. Transformation-coupled autoinhibition allows RfaH to 
achieve high specificity and potent activation of gene expression.

RfaH, a transcription regulator of the universally conserved NusG/Spt5 family, 
utilizes a unique mode of recruitment to elongating RNA polymerase to activate 
virulence genes. RfaH function depends critically on an ops sequence, an 
exemplar of a consensus pause, in the non-template DNA strand of the 
transcription bubble. We used structural and functional analyses to elucidate 
the role of ops in RfaH recruitment. Our results demonstrate that ops induces 
pausing to facilitate RfaH binding and establishes direct contacts with RfaH. 
Strikingly, the non-template DNA forms a hairpin in the RfaH:ops complex 
structure, flipping out a conserved T residue that is specifically recognized by 
RfaH. Molecular modeling and genetic evidence support the notion that ops 
hairpin is required for RfaH recruitment. We argue that both the sequence and 
the structure of the non-template strand are read out by transcription factors, 
expanding the repertoire of transcriptional regulators in all domains of life.

λN-mediated processive antitermination constitutes a paradigmatic transcription 
regulatory event, during which phage protein λN, host factors NusA, NusB, NusE 
and NusG, and an RNA nut site render elongating RNA polymerase 
termination-resistant. The structural basis of the process has so far remained 
elusive. Here we describe a crystal structure of a λN-NusA-NusB-NusE-nut site 
complex and an electron cryo-microscopic structure of a complete transcription 
antitermination complex, comprising RNA polymerase, DNA, nut site RNA, all Nus 
factors and λN, validated by crosslinking/mass spectrometry. Due to intrinsic 
disorder, λN can act as a multiprotein/RNA interaction hub, which, together with 
nut site RNA, arranges NusA, NusB and NusE into a triangular complex. This 
complex docks via the NusA N-terminal domain and the λN C-terminus next to the 
RNA exit channel on RNA polymerase. Based on the structures, comparative 
crosslinking analyses and structure-guided mutagenesis, we hypothesize that λN 
mounts a multipronged strategy to reprogram the transcriptional machinery, which 
may include (1) the λN C terminus clamping the RNA exit channel, thus 
stabilizing the DNA:RNA hybrid; (2) repositioning of NusA and RNAP elements, 
thus redirecting nascent RNA and sequestering the upstream branch of a 
terminator hairpin; and (3) hindering RNA engagement of termination factor ρ 
and/or obstructing ρ translocation on the transcript.

NusG, the only universally conserved transcription factor, comprises an N- and a 
C-terminal domain (NTD, CTD) that are flexibly connected and move independently 
in Escherichia coli and other organisms. In NusG from the hyperthermophilic 
bacterium Thermotoga maritima (tmNusG), however, NTD and CTD interact tightly. 
This closed state stabilizes the CTD, but masks the binding sites for the 
interaction partners Rho, NusE and RNA polymerase (RNAP), suggesting that tmNusG 
is autoinhibited. Furthermore, tmNusG and some other bacterial NusGs have an 
additional domain, DII, of unknown function. Here we demonstrate that tmNusG is 
indeed autoinhibited and that binding to RNAP may stabilize the open 
conformation. We identified two interdomain salt bridges as well as Phe336 as 
major determinants of the domain interaction. By successive weakening of this 
interaction we show that after domain dissociation tmNusG-CTD can bind to Rho 
and NusE, similar to the Escherichia coli NusG-CTD, indicating that these 
interactions are conserved in bacteria. Furthermore, we show that tmNusG-DII 
interacts with RNAP as well as nucleic acids with a clear preference for double 
stranded DNA. We suggest that tmNusG-DII supports tmNusG recruitment to the 
transcription elongation complex and stabilizes the tmNusG:RNAP complex, a 
necessary adaptation to high temperatures.

NusA and NusG are major regulators of bacterial transcription elongation, which 
act either in concert or antagonistically. Both bind to RNA polymerase (RNAP), 
regulating pausing as well as intrinsic and Rho-dependent termination. Here, we 
demonstrate by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy that the Escherichia coli 
NusG amino-terminal domain forms a complex with the acidic repeat domain 2 (AR2) 
of NusA. The interaction surface of either transcription factor overlaps with 
the respective binding site for RNAP. We show that NusA-AR2 is able to remove 
NusG from RNAP. Our in vivo and in vitro results suggest that interaction 
between NusA and NusG could play various regulatory roles during transcription, 
including recruitment of NusG to RNAP, resynchronization of 
transcription:translation coupling, and modulation of termination efficiency.

In bacteria, RNA polymerase (RNAP), the central enzyme of transcription, is 
regulated by N-utilization substance (Nus) transcription factors. Several of 
these factors interact directly, and only transiently, with RNAP to modulate its 
function. As details of these interactions are largely unknown, we probed the 
RNAP binding surfaces of Escherichia coli (E. coli) Nus factors by nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Perdeuterated factors with 
[(1)H,(13)C]-labeled methyl groups of Val, Leu, and Ile residues were titrated 
with protonated RNAP. After verification of this approach with the N-terminal 
domain (NTD) of NusG and RNAP we determined the RNAP binding site of NusE. It 
overlaps with the NusE interaction surface for the NusG C-terminal domain, 
indicating that RNAP and NusG compete for NusE and suggesting possible roles for 
the NusE:RNAP interaction, e.g. in antitermination and direct 
transcription:translation coupling. We solved the solution structure of NusA-NTD 
by NMR spectroscopy, identified its RNAP binding site with the same approach we 
used for NusG-NTD, and here present a detailed model of the NusA-NTD:RNAP:RNA 
complex.

Transcription elongation factor NusG from Escherichia coli couples transcription 
and translation. It is the only conserved transcription factor in all three 
kingdoms of life, playing a variety of roles in gene expression. E. coli NusG 
consists of two non-interacting domains. While the N-terminal domain interacts 
with RNA polymerase, the C-terminal domain contacts NusE (S10), or the Rho 
transcription termination factor. The two corresponding domains of Thermotoga 
maritima NusG are mutually interacting. Therefore, NusG here forms an 
autoinhibited state, where the binding sites to RNAP, NusE, and the Rho factor 
are masked. Recent functional studies showed differences between NusG from E. 
coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In contrast to E. coli NusG, M. 
tuberculosis NusG is able to stimulate intrinsic termination, but is not able to 
bind the Rho factor. To analyze whether this has structural reasons, we 
determined the solution structure of the carboxyterminal domain of M. 
tuberculosis NusG by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, we 
modeled the wild-type full-length protein, and present evidence that the two 
domains of this protein do not interact in solution by NMR dynamics 
measurements.

A DNA fragment containing the genes secE, nusG and rplK of Staphylococcus 
carnsosus was cloned using the Escherichia coli rplK gene as a probe. The S. 
carnosus secE homologue encodes a protein of 65 amino acid residues which is 
homologous to the carboxyl-terminal region of the E. coli SecE protein. The S. 
carnosus SecE polypeptide which, in contrast to the E. coli SecE protein, 
contains only one putative transmembrane segment, could fully replace the E. 
coli SecE protein in two different secE mutants. These results strongly suggest 
that the identified secE gene encodes an important component of the S. carnosus 
protein export apparatus.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) 
and requires additional protein-protein interactions to regulate the expression 
of target genes. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the previously 
described protein L7, that specifically interacted with the VDR in the presence 
of vitamin D. Deletion analysis indicated, that the N-terminus of L7, which 
harbours a basic region leucine zipper like domain, mediated interaction with 
the VDR. Binding assays with purified GST-L7 demonstrated, that L7 specifically 
pulled down the VDR, that was either expressed in yeast or endogenously 
contained in the cell line U937. Interestingly, L7 inhibited ligand-dependent 
VDR-RXR heterodimerization, when constitutively expressed in yeast. We also 
demonstrate that L7 repressed binding of VDR-RXR heterodimers to a vitamin D 
response element. Surprisingly, L7 recruited RXR to the same response element in 
the presence of 9-cis retinoic acid. Ligand-dependent protein-protein 
interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system confirmed, that binding of L7 also 
was targeted at the RXR. Our data suggest, that protein L7 is a coregulator of 
VDR-RXR mediated transactivation of genes, that modulates transcriptional 
activity by interfering with binding of the receptors to genomic enhancer 
elements.

from 50S ribosomal subunits of two representative archaebacteria, namely 
Methanococcus vaniellii and Sulfolobus solfataricus, is accompanied by loss of 
the archaebacterial L10 and L12 proteins. The stalk was reformed if 
archaebacterial core particles were reconstituted with their corresponding split 
proteins. Next, structurally intact chimeric 50S subunits have been 
reconstituted in vitro by addition of Escherichia coli ribosomal proteins L10 
and L7/L12 to 50S core particles from M vaniellii or S solfataricus, 
respectively. In the reverse experiment, using core particles from E coli and 
split proteins from M vaniellii, stalk-bearing 50S particles were also obtained. 
Analysis of the reconstituted 50S subunits by immunoblotting revealed that E 
coli L10 was incorporated into archaebacterial core particles in both presence 
or absence of E coli L7/L12. In contrast, incorporation of E coli L7/L12 into 
archaebacterial cores was only possible in the presence of E coli L10. Our 
results suggest that in archaebacteria - as in E coli - the stalk is formed by 
archaebacterial L12 proteins that bind to the ribosome via L10. The structural 
equivalence of eubacterial and archaebacterial L10 and L12 proteins has thus for 
the first time been established. The chimeric reconstitution experiments provide 
evidence that the domain of protein L10 that interacts with the ribosomal 
particle is highly conserved between eubacteria and archaebacteria.

OBJECTIVES: Rifampicin, a potent first-line TB drug of the rifamycin group, 
shows only little activity against the emerging pathogen Mycobacterium 
abscessus. Reportedly, bacterial resistance to rifampicin is associated with 
polymorphisms in the target gene rpoB or the presence of enzymes that modify and 
thereby inactivate rifampicin. The aim of this study was to investigate the role 
of the MAB_0591 (arrMab)-encoded rifampicin ADP-ribosyltransferase (Arr_Mab) in 
innate high-level rifampicin resistance in M. abscessus.
METHODS: Recombinant Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains 
expressing MAB_0591 were generated, as was an M. abscessus deletion mutant 
deficient for MAB_0591. MIC assays were used to study susceptibility to 
rifampicin and C25 carbamate-modified rifamycin derivatives.
RESULTS: Heterologous expression of MAB_0591 conferred rifampicin resistance to 
E. coli and M. tuberculosis Rifamycin MIC values were consistently lower for the 
M. abscessus ΔarrMab mutant as compared with the M. abscessus ATCC 19977 
parental type strain. The rifamycin WT phenotype was restored after 
complementation of the M. abscessus ΔarrMab mutant with arrMab Further MIC data 
demonstrated that a C25 modification increases rifamycin activity in WT M. 
abscessus However, MIC studies in the M. abscessus ΔarrMab mutant suggest that 
C25 modified rifamycins are still subject to modification by Arr_Mab 
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify Arr_Mab as the major innate rifamycin 
resistance determinant of M. abscessus. Our data also indicate that 
Arr_Mab-mediated rifamycin resistance in M. abscessus can only in part be 
overcome by C25 carbamate modification.

Comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppGpp 
synthetases/hydrolases (the Rel, RelA and SpoT proteins).

In the gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, the effector molecule of 
the stringent response, (p)ppGpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, RelA 
and SpoT, whereas in the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis only one 
enzyme named Rel is responsible for this activity. Rel and SpoT also possess 
(p)ppGpp hydrolase activity. BLAST searches were used to identify orthologous 
genes in databases. The construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees 
allowed classification of these orthologs. Four groups could be distinguished: 
With the exception of Neisseria and Bordetella (beta subdivision), the RelA and 
SpoT groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. 
Two Rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the Bacillus/Clostridium 
group were also identified. The SpoT proteins are related to the gram positive 
Rel proteins. RelA proteins carry substitutions in the HD domain (Aravind and 
Koonin, 1998, TIBS 23: 469-472) responsible for ppGpp degradation. A theory for 
the evolution of the specialized, paralogous relA and spoT genes is presented: 
After gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spoT and relA genes 
evolved from the duplicated genes. The distribution pattern of the paralogous 
RelA and SpoT proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution 
(Gupta, 2000, FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 24: 367-402). This model postulates that the 
gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved 
bacterial lineage. However, two paralogous, closely related genes of 
Porphyromonas gingivalis (Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum) encoding 
proteins with functions probably identical to the RelA and SpoT proteins do not 
fit in this model. Completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic 
organisms (Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia species, Rickettsia prowazekii) and the 
obligate aphid symbiont Buchnera sp. APS as well as archaea do not contain 
rel-like genes but they are present in the Arabidopsis genome. In crosslinking 
experiments using different analogs of ppGpp as crosslinking reagents and RNA 
polymerase preparations of Escherichia coli, binding of ppGpp to distinct 
regions at the C-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoB gene product) and/or at 
the N-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoC gene product) was observed 
previously. RpoB and RpoC sequences of the species which do not possess a rel 
like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppGpp binding 
regions.

Eighty-one clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori showed no resistance to 
rifampin (MIC range, 0.032 to 2 microg/ml; MIC at which 50% of isolates are 
inhibited [MIC50], 0.25 microg/ml). The MIC50 of rifabutin was 0.008 microg/ml 
(n = 16). All resistant laboratory mutants of H. pylori ATCC 43504 showed amino 
acid exchanges in codons 524 to 545 or codon 585 of the rpoB gene, corresponding 
to the gene sequences from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli.

Rifampicin resistance of Mu lysogenic strains by rpoB mutations.

Kirschbaum TM(1), Götte RF.

Author information:
(1)Institut für Biochemie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München.

The resistance of Escherichia coli against the antibiotic rifampicin is caused 
by mutations in the rpoB gene which alter the structure of the beta subunit of 
the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. By insertion-mutagenesis with bacteriophage Mu 
rifampicin-resistant mutants that were believed to have a sensitive RNA 
polymerase had been generated. For closer analysis of this putative 
rpoB-independent mechanism of resistance we cloned and sequenced the insertion 
sites from two of the Mu lysogens. One of them showed > 95% sequence similarity 
with the phn locus of E. coli B, and was mapped between nt 3824 and 3825 within 
the phnB gene. This positions the phn locus between 4397 and 4410 kb of the 
Kohara map of E. coli K-12. Since both analysed insertion sites differ in 
respect to each other and to the findings of previous work we determined the 
rifampicin sensitivity of the RNA polymerase of the Mu lysogens with partially 
purified enzyme. For all mutants the IC50 as a measure for sensitivity was 
significantly higher than for the parent strain. Sequence analysis of part of 
the rpoB gene (nt 1519 to 1716) revealed single point mutations in the 
investigated Mu lysogens. The rpoB mutation is necessary and sufficient for the 
observed resistance, while the prophage alone does not evoke resistance and has 
no synergistic effect together with the rpoB mutation. Our work supports the 
assumption that rifampicin like other hydrophobic molecules enters the cell via 
simple diffusion through the outer membrane with LPS being the main 
barrier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Genes for DNA-dependent RNA polymerase components B, A, and C from the 
archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and for components B", B', A, and C 
from the archaebacterium Halobacterium halobium were cloned and sequenced. They 
are organized in gene clusters in the order above, which corresponds to the 
order of the homologous rpoB and rpoC genes in the corresponding operon of the 
Escherichia coli genome. Derived amino acid sequences of archaebacterial 
components A and C were aligned with each other and with the sequences of 
corresponding (largest) subunits from the archaebacterium Methanobacterium 
thermoautotrophicum, with sequences of various eukaryotic nuclear RNA 
polymerases I, II, and III, and with the sequence of the beta' component from E. 
coli polymerase. The archaebacterial genes for component A are homologous to 
about the first two-thirds of genes for the eukaryotic component A and the 
eubacterial component beta', and the archaebacterial genes for component C are 
homologous to the last third of the genes for the eukaryotic component A and the 
eubacterial component beta'. Unrooted phylogenetic dendrograms derived from both 
distance matrix and parsimony analyses show the archaebacteria are a coherent 
group closely related to the eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerase II and/or III 
lineages. The eukaryotic polymerase I lineage appears to arise separately from a 
bifurcation with the eubacterial beta' component lineage.

Anode-assisted fermentations offer the benefit of an anoxic fermentation routine 
that can be applied to produce end-products with an oxidation state independent 
from the substrate. The whole cell biocatalyst transfers the surplus of 
electrons to an electrode that can be used as a non-depletable electron 
acceptor. So far, anode-assisted fermentations were shown to provide high carbon 
efficiencies but low space-time yields. This study aimed at increasing 
space-time yields of an Escherichia coli-based anode-assisted fermentation of 
glucose to acetoin. The experiments build on an obligate respiratory strain, 
that was advanced using selective adaptation and targeted strain development. 
Several transfers under respiratory conditions led to point mutations in the 
pfl, aceF and rpoC gene. These mutations increased anoxic growth by three-fold. 
Furthermore, overexpression of genes encoding a synthetic electron transport 
chain to methylene blue increased the electron transfer rate by 2.45-fold. 
Overall, these measures and a medium optimization increased the space-time yield 
in an electrode-assisted fermentation by 3.6-fold.

Escherichia coli catabolizes L-tartrate under anaerobic conditions to 
oxaloacetate by the use of L-tartrate/succinate antiporter TtdT and L-tartrate 
dehydratase TtdAB. Subsequently, L-malate is channelled into fumarate 
respiration and degraded to succinate by the use of fumarase FumB and fumarate 
reductase FrdABCD. The genes encoding the latter pathway (dcuB, fumB and 
frdABCD) are transcriptionally activated by the DcuS-DcuR two-component system. 
Expression of the L-tartrate-specific ttdABT operon encoding TtdAB and TtdT was 
stimulated by the LysR-type gene regulator TtdR in the presence of L- and 
meso-tartrate, and repressed by O(2) and nitrate. Anaerobic expression required 
a functional fnr gene, and nitrate repression depended on NarL and NarP. 
Expression of ttdR, encoding TtdR, was repressed by O(2), nitrate and glucose, 
and positively regulated by TtdR and DcuS. Purified TtdR specifically bound to 
the ttdR-ttdA promoter region. TtdR was also required for full expression of the 
DcuS-DcuR-dependent dcuB gene in the presence of tartrate. Overall, expression 
of the ttdABT genes is subject to L-/meso-tartrate-dependent induction, and to 
aerobic and nitrate repression. The control is exerted directly at ttdA and in 
addition indirectly by regulating TtdR levels. TtdR recognizes a subgroup (L- 
and meso-tartrate) of the stimuli perceived by the sensor DcuS, which responds 
to all C(4)-dicarboxylates; both systems apparently communicate by mutual 
regulation of the regulatory genes.

DcuB of Escherichia coli catalyzes C4-dicarboxylate/succinate antiport during 
growth by fumarate respiration. The expression of genes of fumarate respiration, 
including the genes for DcuB (dcuB) and fumarate reductase (frdABCD) is 
transcriptionally activated by C4-dicarboxylates via the DcuS-DcuR two-component 
system, comprising the sensor kinase DcuS, which contains a periplasmic sensing 
domain for C4-dicarboxylates. Deletion or inactivation of dcuB caused 
constitutive expression of DcuS-regulated genes in the absence of 
C4-dicarboxylates. The effect was specific for DcuB and not observed after 
inactivation of the homologous DcuA or the more distantly related DcuC 
transporter. Random and site-directed mutation identified three point mutations 
(T394I, D398N, and K353A) in DcuB that caused a similar derepression as dcuB 
deletion, whereas the transport activity of the DcuB mutants was retained. 
Constitutive expression in the dcuB mutants depended on the presence of a 
functional DcuS-DcuR two-component system. Mutation of residues E79A, R83A, and 
R127A of DcuB, on the other hand, inactivated growth by fumarate respiration and 
transport of [14C]succinate, whereas the expression of dcuB'-'lacZ was not 
affected. Therefore, the antiporter DcuB is a bifunctional protein and has a 
regulatory function that is independent from transport, and sites for transport 
and regulation can be differentiated.

Anaerobic growth of Escherichia coli on D-tartrate depends on the fumarate 
carrier DcuB and fumarase, rather than the L-tartrate carrier TtdT and 
L-tartrate dehydratase.

15, 55099 Mainz, Germany.

Escherichia coli is able to grow under anaerobic conditions on D: -tartrate when 
glycerol is supplied as an electron donor (D-tartrate fermentation). D-Tartrate 
was converted to succinate. Growth was lost in strains deficient for DcuB, the 
fumarate/succinate antiporter of fumarate respiration. The L-tartrate/succinate 
antiporter TtdT of L-tartrate fermentation, or the C4-dicarboxylate carriers 
DcuA and DcuC, were not able to support D-tartrate transport and fermentation. 
Deletion of fumB demonstrated, that fumarase B is required for growth on 
D-tartrate. The mutant lost most (about 79%) of D-tartrate dehydratase activity. 
L-Tartrate dehydratase (TtdAB), and fumarase A or C, showed no or only a small 
contribution to D-tartrate dehydratase activity. Therefore D-tartrate is 
metabolised by a sequence of reactions analogous to that from L-tartrate 
fermentation, including dehydration to oxaloacetate, which is then converted to 
malate, fumarate and succinate. The stereoisomer specific carrier TtdT and 
dehydratase TtdAB of L-tartrate fermentation are substituted by enzymes from 
general anaerobic fumarate metabolism, the antiporter DcuB and fumarase B, which 
have a broader substrate specificity. No D-tartrate specific carriers and 
enzymes are involved in the pathway.

The L-tartrate/succinate antiporter TtdT (YgjE) of L-tartrate fermentation in 
Escherichia coli.

Escherichia coli ferments L-tartrate under anaerobic conditions in the presence 
of an additional electron donor to succinate. The carrier for L-tartrate uptake 
and succinate export and its relation to the general C(4)-dicarboxylate carriers 
DcuA, DcuB, and DcuC were studied. The secondary carrier TtdT, encoded by the 
ttdT (previously called ygjE) gene, is required for the uptake of L-tartrate. 
The ttdT gene is located downstream of the ttdA and ttdB genes, encoding the 
L-tartrate dehydratase TtdAB. Analysis of mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR 
showed that ttdA, ttdB, and ttdT are cotranscribed. Deletion of ttdT abolished 
growth by L-tartrate and degradation of L-tartrate completely. Bacteria 
containing TtdT catalyze L-tartrate or succinate uptake and specific 
heterologous L-tartrate/succinate antiporting. D-Tartrate is not a substrate for 
TtdT. TtdT operates preferentially in the direction of tartrate uptake and 
succinate excretion. The Dcu carriers do not support anaerobic growth on 
L-tartrate or L-tartrate transport. TtdT is related in sequence and function to 
CitT, which catalyzes heterologous citrate/succinate antiporting in citrate 
fermentation.

specific for C(4) -dicarboxylates. The nature of the stimulus and its structural 
prerequisites were determined by measuring the induction of DcuS-dependent 
dcuB'-'lacZ gene expression. C(4)-dicarboxylates without or with substitutions 
at C2/C3 by hydrophilic (hydroxy, amino, or thiolate) groups stimulated gene 
expression in a similar way. When one carboxylate was replaced by sulfonate, 
methoxy, or nitro groups, only the latter (3-nitropropionate) was active. Thus, 
the ligand of DcuS has to carry two carboxylate or carboxylate/nitro groups 
3.1-3.8 A apart from each other. The effector concentrations for half-maximal 
induction of dcuB'-'lacZ expression were 2-3 mm for the C(4)-dicarboxylates and 
0.5 mm for 3-nitropropionate or d-tartrate. The periplasmic domain of DcuS 
contains a conserved cluster of positively charged or polar amino acid residues 
(Arg(107)-X(2)-His(110)-X(9)-Phe(120)-X(26)-Arg(147)-X-Phe(149)) that were 
essential for fumarate-dependent transcriptional regulation. The presence of 
fumarate or d-tartrate caused sharpening of peaks or chemical shift changes in 
HSQC NMR spectra of the isolated C(4)-dicarboylate binding domain. The amino 
acid residues responding to fumarate or d-tartrate were in the region comprising 
residues 89-150 and including the supposed binding site. DcuS(R147A) mutant with 
an inactivated binding site was isolated and reconstituted in liposomes. The 
protein showed the same (activation-independent) kinase activity as DcuS, but 
autophosphorylation of DcuS was no longer stimulated by C(4)-dicarboxylates. 
Therefore, the R147A mutation affected signal perception and transfer to the 
kinase but not the kinase activity per se.

The function of the response regulator DcuR of the DcuSR fumarate two-component 
sensory system of Escherichia coli was analysed in vitro. Isolated DcuR protein 
was phosphorylated by the sensory histidine kinase, DcuS, and ATP, or by acetyl 
phosphate. In gel retardation assays with target promoters (frdA, dcuB, dctA), 
phosphoryl DcuR (DcuR-P) formed a high-affinity complex, with an apparent K(D) 
(app. K(D)) of 0.2-0.3 microM DcuR-P, and a low-affinity (app. K(D) 0.8-2 
microM) complex. The high-affinity complex was formed only with promoters 
transcriptionally-regulated by DcuSR, whereas low-affinity binding was seen also 
with some DcuSR-independent promoters. The binding site of DcuR-P at the dcuB 
promoter was determined by DNase I footprinting. One binding site of 42-52 nt 
(position -359 to -400/-410 nt upstream of the transcriptional start) was 
identified in the presence of low and high concentrations of DcuR-P. 
Non-phosphorylated DcuR, or DcuR-D56N mutated in the phosphoryl-accepting Asp56 
residue, showed low-affinity binding to target promoters. DcuR-D56N was still 
able to interact with DcuS. DcuR-D56N increased the phosphorylation of DcuS and 
competitively inhibited phosphoryl transfer to wild-type DcuR.

Function of DcuS from Escherichia coli as a fumarate-stimulated histidine

The two-component regulatory system DcuSR of Escherichia coli controls the 
expression of genes of C(4)-dicarboxylate metabolism in response to 
extracellular C(4)- dicarboxylates such as fumarate or succinate. DcuS is a 
membrane-integral sensor kinase, and the sensory and kinase domains are located 
on opposite sides of the cytoplasmic membrane. The intact DcuS protein 
(His(6)-DcuS) was overproduced and isolated in detergent containing buffer. 
His(6)-DcuS was reconstituted into liposomes made from E. coli phospholipids. 
Reconstituted His(6)-DcuS catalyzed, in contrast to the detergent-solubilized 
sensor, autophosphorylation by [gamma-(33)P]ATP with an approximate K(D) of 0.16 
mm for ATP. Up to 7% of the reconstituted DcuS was phosphorylated. 
Phosphorylation was stimulated up to 5.9-fold by C(4)-dicarboxylates, but not by 
other carboxylates. The phosphoryl group of DcuS was rapidly transferred to the 
response regulator DcuR. Upon phosphorylation, DcuR bound specifically to dcuB 
promoter DNA. The reconstituted DcuSR system therefore represents a defined in 
vitro system, which is capable of the complete transmembrane signal transduction 
by the DcuSR two-component system from the stimulus (fumarate) to the DNA, 
including signal transfer across the phospholipid membrane.

DctA- and Dcu-independent transport of succinate in Escherichia coli: 
contribution of diffusion and of alternative carriers.

(1)Institut für Mikrobiologie und Weinforschung, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität 
Mainz, Becherweg 15, 55099 Mainz, Germany.

Quintuple mutants of Escherichia coli deficient in the C(4)-dicarboxylate 
carriers of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (DctA, DcuA, DcuB, DcuC, and the 
DcuC homolog DcuD, or the citrate/succinate antiporter CitT) showed only poor 
growth on succinate (or other C(4)-dicarboxylates) under oxic conditions. At 
acidic pH (pH 6) the mutants regained aerobic growth on succinate, but not on 
fumarate. Succinate uptake by the mutants could not be saturated at 
physiological succinate concentrations (< or =5 mM), in contrast to the 
wild-type, which had a K(m) for succinate of 50 microM and a V(max) of 35 U/g 
dry weight at pH 6. At high substrate concentrations, the mutants showed 
transport activities (32 U/g dry weight) comparable to that of the wild-type. In 
the wild-type using DctA as the carrier, succinate uptake had a pH optimum of 6, 
whereas succinate uptake in the mutants was maximal at pH 5. In the mutants 
succinate uptake was inhibited competitively by monocarboxylic acids. Diffusion 
of succinate or fumarate across phospholipid membranes (liposomes) was orders of 
magnitude slower than the transport in the wild-type or the mutants. The data 
suggest that mutants deficient in DctA, DcuA, DcuB, DcuC, DcuD (or CitT) contain 
a carrier, possibly a monocarboxylate carrier, which is able to transport 
succinate, but not fumarate, at acidic pH, when succinate is present as a 
monoanion. Succinate uptake by this carrier was inhibited by addition of an 
uncoupler. Growth by fumarate respiration (requiring fumarate/succinate 
antiport) was also lost in the quintuple mutants, and growth was not restored at 
pH 6. In contrast, the efflux of succinate produced during glucose fermentation 
was not affected in the mutants, demonstrating that, for succinate efflux, a 
carrier different from, or in addition to, the known Dcu and CitT carriers is 
used.

Transport of C(4)-dicarboxylates in Wolinella succinogenes.

C(4)-dicarboxylate transport is a prerequisite for anaerobic respiration with 
fumarate in Wolinella succinogenes, since the substrate site of fumarate 
reductase is oriented towards the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. W. 
succinogenes was found to transport C(4)-dicarboxylates (fumarate, succinate, 
malate, and aspartate) across the cytoplasmic membrane by antiport and uniport 
mechanisms. The electrogenic uniport resulted in dicarboxylate accumulation 
driven by anaerobic respiration. The molar ratio of internal to external 
dicarboxylate concentration was up to 10(3). The dicarboxylate antiport was 
either electrogenic or electroneutral. The electroneutral antiport required the 
presence of internal Na(+), whereas the electrogenic antiport also operated in 
the absence of Na(+). In the absence of Na(+), no electrochemical proton 
potential (delta p) was measured across the membrane of cells catalyzing 
fumarate respiration. This suggests that the proton potential generated by 
fumarate respiration is dissipated by the concomitant electrogenic dicarboxylate 
antiport. Three gene loci (dcuA, dcuB, and dctPQM) encoding putative 
C(4)-dicarboxylate transporters were identified on the genome of W. 
succinogenes. The predicted gene products of dcuA and dcuB are similar to the 
Dcu transporters that are involved in the fumarate respiration of Escherichia 
coli with external C(4)-dicarboxylates. The genes dctP, -Q, and -M probably 
encode a binding-protein-dependent secondary uptake transporter for 
dicarboxylates. A mutant (DcuA(-) DcuB(-)) of W. succinogenes lacking the intact 
dcuA and dcuB genes grew by nitrate respiration with succinate as the carbon 
source but did not grow by fumarate respiration with fumarate, malate, or 
aspartate as substrates. The DcuA(-), DcuB(-), and DctQM(-) mutants grew by 
fumarate respiration as well as by nitrate respiration with succinate as the 
carbon source. Cells of the DcuA(-) DcuB(-) mutant performed fumarate 
respiration without generating a proton potential even in the presence of Na(+). 
This explains why the DcuA(-) DcuB(-) mutant does not grow by fumarate 
respiration. Growth by fumarate respiration appears to depend on the function of 
the Na(+)-dependent, electroneutral dicarboxylate antiport which is catalyzed 
exclusively by the Dcu transporters. Dicarboxylate transport via the 
electrogenic uniport is probably catalyzed by the DctPQM transporter and by a 
fourth, unknown transporter that may also operate as an electrogenic antiporter.

Functioning of DcuC as the C4-dicarboxylate carrier during glucose fermentation 
by Escherichia coli.

Mainz, 55099 Mainz, Germany.

The dcuC gene of Escherichia coli encodes an alternative C4-dicarboxylate 
carrier (DcuC) with low transport activity. The expression of dcuC was 
investigated. dcuC was expressed only under anaerobic conditions; nitrate and 
fumarate caused slight repression and stimulation of expression, respectively. 
Anaerobic induction depended mainly on the transcriptional regulator FNR. 
Fumarate stimulation was independent of the fumarate response regulator DcuR. 
The expression of dcuC was not significantly inhibited by glucose, assigning a 
role to DcuC during glucose fermentation. The inactivation of dcuC increased 
fumarate-succinate exchange and fumarate uptake by DcuA and DcuB, suggesting a 
preferential function of DcuC in succinate efflux during glucose fermentation. 
Upon overexpression in a dcuC promoter mutant (dcuC*), DcuC was able to 
compensate for DcuA and DcuB in fumarate-succinate exchange and fumarate uptake.

Control of Fur synthesis by the non-coding RNA RyhB and iron-responsive 
decoding.

The Fe2+-dependent Fur protein serves as a negative regulator of iron uptake in 
bacteria. As only metallo-Fur acts as an autogeneous repressor, Fe2+scarcity 
would direct fur expression when continued supply is not obviously required. We 
show that in Escherichia coli post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms ensure 
that Fur synthesis remains steady in iron limitation. Our studies revealed that 
fur translation is coupled to that of an upstream open reading frame (uof), 
translation of which is downregulated by the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) RyhB. As 
RyhB transcription is negatively controlled by metallo-Fur, iron depletion 
creates a negative feedback loop. RyhB-mediated regulation of uof-fur provides 
the first example for indirect translational regulation by a trans-encoded 
ncRNA. In addition, we present evidence for an iron-responsive decoding 
mechanism of the uof-fur entity. It could serve as a backup mechanism of the 
RyhB circuitry, and represents the first link between iron availability and 
synthesis of an iron-containing protein.

Isolation and characterization of hypophosphite--resistant mutants of 
Escherichia coli: identification of the FocA protein, encoded by the pfl operon, 
as a putative formate transporter.

Suppmann B(1), Sawers G.

Hypophosphite was used as a toxic analogue to identify genes whose products have 
a putative function in the transport of formate. Two Tn10-derived insertion 
mutants were identified that exhibited increased resistance to high 
concentrations of hypophosphite in the culture medium. The transposon was 
located in the identical position in the focA (formate channel; previously 
termed orf) gene of the pfl operon in both mutants. A defined chromosomal focA 
nonsense mutant, which showed minimal polarity effects on pfl gene expression, 
had the same phenotype as the insertion mutants. Results obtained using a 
hycA-lacZ fusion to monitor changes in the intracellular formate concentration 
in a focA mutant indicated that the level of formate inside the cell was 
elevated compared with the wild type. Moreover, it could be shown that there was 
a corresponding reduction of approximately 50% in the amount of formate excreted 
by a focA mutant into the culture medium. Taken together, these results indicate 
that formate accumulates in anaerobic cells which do not have a functional focA 
gene product and that one function of FocA may be to export formate from the 
cell. A further significant result was that hypophosphite could substitute for 
formate in activating hycA gene expression. This hypophosphite-dependent 
activation of hycA gene expression was reduced 10-fold in a focA null mutant, 
suggesting that hypophosphite must first enter the cell before it can act as a 
signal to activate hycA expression. By analogy, these data suggest that focA may 
also be functional in the import of formate into anaerobic Escherichia coli 
cells. Site-specific mutagenesis identified the translation initiation codon of 
focA as a GUG. Therefore, the FocA polypeptide has a molecular weight of 30,958. 
FocA shows significant similarity at both the primary and secondary structural 
levels with the NirC protein of E. coli and the FdhC protein of Methanobacterium 
formicicum. All three proteins are predicted to be integral membrane proteins. A 
detailed in vivo TnphoA mutagenesis study predicted that FocA has six 
membrane-spanning segments.

Role of Staphylococcus aureus Tet38 in Transport of Tetracycline and Its 
Regulation in a Salt Stress Environment.

Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Staphylococcus aureus Tet38 efflux pump has multiple functions, including 
conferring resistance to tetracycline and other compounds and enabling 
internalization and survival within epithelial cells. In this study, we 
evaluated the effects of sodium and potassium on tet38 expression. These 
monovalent cations are known to play a role in transport by the related S. 
aureus TetK and B. subtilis TetL transporters. tet38 transcription decreased 
with increasing sodium concentrations by means of direct repression by the salt 
stress-dependent KdpD/E regulator. tet38 transcription increased 20-fold and 
tetracycline minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) increased 4-fold in a ΔkdpD 
mutant. KdpE bound specifically to the tet38 promoter. Under extreme salt 
stress, the survival of S. aureus with intact tet38 was reduced compared to that 
of a Δtet38 mutant. To study the effect of sodium on Tet38 function, we 
generated constructs overexpressing tet38 and tetK and introduced them into 
Escherichia coli TO114, which is deficient in major sodium transporters. Tet38 
tetracycline efflux was directly demonstrated in a fluorescence assay, and 
tetracycline efflux of both Tet38 and TetK was abolished by the protonophore 
carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). In contrast, NaCl inhibited 
efflux by Tet38 but not TetK, whereas KCl inhibited efflux by TetK but not 
Tet38. Cell-associated Na increased with heterologous overexpression of Tet38. 
These data indicate that S. aureus Tet38 is a tetracycline efflux pump regulated 
by the KdpD/E regulator. Under salt stress, S. aureus adjusted its survival in 
part by reducing the expression of tet38 through KdpD/E. The mechanisms by which 
Tet38 is detrimental to salt tolerance in S. aureus and inhibited by sodium 
remain to be determined. IMPORTANCE This study shows that S. aureus Tet38 is a 
tetracycline efflux pump regulated by KdpD/E regulator. These findings are the 
first direct demonstration of Tet38-mediated tetracycline efflux, which had 
previously been inferred from its ability to confer tetracycline resistance. 
Under salt stress, S. aureus adjusts its survival in part by reducing the 
expression of tet38 through KdpD/E. We demonstrated the differences in the 
respective functions of S. aureus Tet38 and other tetracycline efflux 
transporters (S. aureus TetK, B. subtilis TetL) regarding their transport of 
tetracycline and Na+/K+. Notably, sodium selectively reduced tetracycline efflux 
by Tet38, and potassium selectively reduced tetracycline efflux by TetK. The 
multiple functions of Tet38 emphasize its importance in bacterial adaptation to 
and survival in diverse environments.

Two-component systems (TCSs), which consist of a histidine kinase (HK) sensor 
and a response regulator (RR), are important for bacteria to quickly sense and 
respond to various environmental signals. HKs and RRs typically function as a 
cognate pair, interacting only with one another to transduce signaling. Precise 
signal transduction in a TCS depends on the specific interactions between the 
receiver domain (RD) of the RR and the dimerization and histidine 
phosphorylation domain (DHp) of the HK. Here, we determined the complex 
structure of KdpDE, a TCS consisting of the HK KdpD and the RR KdpE, which is 
responsible for K+ homeostasis. Both the RD and the DNA binding domain (DBD) of 
KdpE interacted with KdpD. Although the RD of KdpE and the DHp of KdpD 
contributed to binding specificity, the DBD mediated a distinct interaction with 
the catalytic ATP-binding (CA) domain of KdpD that was indispensable for 
KdpDE-mediated signal transduction. Moreover, the DBD-CA interface largely 
overlapped with that of the DBD-DNA complex, leading to competition between KdpD 
and its target promoter in a KdpE phosphorylation-dependent manner. In addition, 
the extended C-terminal tail of the CA domain was critical for stabilizing the 
interaction with KdpDE and for signal transduction. Together, these data provide 
a molecular basis for specific KdpD and KdpE interactions that play key roles in 
efficient signal transduction and transcriptional regulation by this TCS.

KdpD/KdpE two-component signaling system regulates expression of a high affinity 
potassium transporter responsible for potassium homeostasis. The C-terminal 
module of KdpD consists of a GAF domain linked to a histidine kinase domain. 
Whereas certain GAF domains act as regulators by binding cyclic nucleotides, the 
role of the juxtamembrane GAF domain in KdpD is unknown. We report the 
high-resolution crystal structure of KdpD GAF domain (KdpDG ) consisting of five 
α-helices, four β-sheets and two large loops. KdpDG forms a symmetry-related 
dimer, wherein parallelly arranged monomers contribute to a four-helix bundle at 
the dimer-interface, SAXS analysis of KdpD C-terminal module reveals an 
elongated structure that is a dimer in solution. Substitution of conserved 
residues with various residues that disrupt the dimer interface produce a range 
of effects on gene expression demonstrating the importance of the interface in 
inactive to active transitions during signaling. Comparison of ligand binding 
site of the classic cyclic nucleotide-binding GAF domains to KdpDG reveals 
structural differences arising from naturally occurring substitutions in primary 
sequence of KdpDG that modifies the canonical NKFDE sequence motif required for 
cyclic nucleotide binding. Together these results suggest a structural role for 
KdpDG in dimerization and transmission of signal to the kinase domain.

Two-component systems (TCSs) are widespread regulatory systems which can help 
bacteria to control their cellular functions and respond to a diverse range of 
stimuli. The KdpD/KdpE system had been well studied for regulating potassium 
transport and identified as an adaptive regulator involved in the virulence of 
some pathogenic bacteria, but its role in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli 
(APEC) was still unknown. In this study, the mutant strain AE17ΔKdpDE was 
obtained successfully of a clinical APEC isolation AE17 using the lambda Red 
recombinase system and performed the transcriptional sequencing of the wild type 
strain AE17 and the mutant strain AE17ΔKdpDE. The transcriptional sequencing 
results revealed that the KdpD/KdpE two-component system mainly influenced the 
expression of the genes covering metabolic pathways, flagellar assembly, global 
transcription regulator. The expression of some flagellar-related genes 
detecting by quantitative real-time PCR was consistent with the results of 
transcriptional sequencing. Importantly, fewer flagellum of the mutant strain 
AE17ΔKdpDE was observed than AE17 using the transmission electron microscope and 
a decreased motility circle of AE17ΔKdpDE appeared in the semisolid medium. In 
addition, the serum bactericidal assay was carried out with the 
specific-pathogen-free chicken in different dilution and the survival ability in 
the serum of AE17ΔKdpDE was also obviously lower than that of AE17. These 
results suggested that in APEC, the KdpD/KdpE two-component system mainly 
influenced the expression of flagella-related genes, the flagellum formation, 
the motility and antiserum bactericidal activity.

environmental K+ concentrations, the dimeric kinase KdpD autophosphorylates in 
trans and transfers the phosphoryl-group to the response regulator KdpE, which 
subsequently activates kdpFABC transcription. In Escherichia coli, KdpD can also 
be activated by interaction with the non-phosphorylated form of the accessory 
protein PtsN. PtsN stimulates KdpD kinase activity thereby increasing 
phospho-KdpE levels. Here, we analyzed the interplay between KdpD/KdpE and PtsN. 
PtsN binds specifically to the catalytic DHp domain of KdpD, which is also 
contacted by KdpE. Accordingly, PtsN and KdpE compete for binding, providing a 
paradox. Low levels of non-phosphorylated PtsN stimulate, whereas high amounts 
reduce kdpFABC expression by blocking access of KdpE to KdpD. Ligand fishing 
experiments provided insight as they revealed ternary complex formation of 
PtsN/KdpD2 /KdpE in vivo demonstrating that PtsN and KdpE bind different 
protomers in the KdpD dimer. PtsN may bind one protomer to stimulate 
phosphorylation of the second KdpD protomer, which then phosphorylates bound 
KdpE. Phosphorylation of PtsN prevents its incorporation in ternary complexes. 
Interaction with the conserved DHp domain enables PtsN to regulate additional 
kinases such as PhoR.

Two-component signal transduction constitutes the predominant strategy used by 
bacteria to adapt to fluctuating environments. The KdpD/KdpE system is one of 
the most widespread, and is crucial for K+ homeostasis. In Escherichia coli, the 
histidine kinase KdpD senses K+ availability, whereas the response regulator 
KdpE activates synthesis of the high-affinity K+ uptake system KdpFABC. Here we 
show that, in the absence of KdpD, kdpFABC expression can be activated via 
phosphorylation of KdpE by the histidine kinase PhoR. PhoR and its cognate 
response regulator PhoB comprise a phosphate-responsive two-component system, 
which senses phosphate limitation indirectly through the phosphate transporter 
PstCAB and its accessory protein PhoU. In vivo two-hybrid interaction studies 
based on the bacterial adenylate cyclase reveal pairwise interactions between 
KdpD, PhoR, and PhoU. Finally, we demonstrate that cross-regulation between the 
kdpFABC and pstSCAB operons occurs in both directions under simultaneous K+ and 
phosphate limitation, both in vitro and in vivo. This study for the first time 
demonstrates direct coupling between intracellular K+ and phosphate homeostasis 
and provides a mechanism for fine-tuning of the balance between positively and 
negatively charged ions in the bacterial cell.

The KdpD Sensor Kinase of Escherichia coli Responds to Several Distinct Signals 
To Turn on Expression of the Kdp Transport System.

Kdp, one of three saturable K(+) uptake systems in Escherichia coli, is the 
system with the highest affinity for K(+) and the only one whose expression is 
strongly controlled by medium K(+) concentration. Expression is controlled by a 
two-component system of KdpD, the sensor kinase, and KdpE, the response 
regulator. There is general agreement that expression occurs when the growth 
rate of cells begins to become limited by K(+) availability. How K(+) limitation 
results in expression has been controversial. Studying the roles of the major 
components of the growth medium shows that KdpD senses at least two distinct 
signals inside the cell, those of Na(+) and NH4 (+), and it probably senses 
other monovalent cations in the cell. KdpD does not sense turgor.
IMPORTANCE: The expression of the Kdp K(+) transport system of E. coli occurs 
when cells become limited in their growth rate by the availability of K(+). 
Cells sense limited K(+) and try to compensate by taking up other monovalent 
cations, particularly Na(+) and NH4 (+). These cations are sensed in the 
cytoplasm by the KdpD response regulator, presumably to stimulate its kinase 
activity. It is shown that KdpD does not sense turgor, as was suggested earlier.

Modeling the Interplay of Pseudomonas putida EIIA with the Potassium Transporter 
KdpFABC.

The nitrogen phosphotransferase system (PTS(Ntr)) of Pseudomonas putida is a key 
regulatory device that participates in controlling many physiological processes 
in a posttranscriptional fashion. One of the target functions of the PTS(Ntr) is 
the regulation of potassium transport. This is mediated by the direct 
interaction of one of its components with the sensor kinase KdpD of the 
two-component system controlling transcription of the kdpFABC genes. From a 
detailed experimental analysis of the activity of the kdpF promoter in P. putida 
wild-type and pts mutant strains with varying potassium concentrations, we had 
highly time-resolved data at hand, describing the influence of the PTS(Ntr) on 
the transcription of the KdpFABC potassium transporter. Here, this data was used 
to construct a mathematical model based on a black box approach. The model was 
able to describe the data quantitatively with convincing accuracy. The 
qualitative interpretation of the model allowed the prediction of two general 
points describing the interplay between the PTS(Ntr) and the KdpFABC potassium 
transporter: (1) the influence of cell number on the performance of the kdpF 
promoter is mainly by dilution by growth and (2) potassium uptake is regulated 
not only by the activity of the KdpD/KdpE two-component system (in turn 
influenced by PtsN). An additional controller with integrative behavior is 
predicted by the model structure. This suggests the presence of a novel 
physiological mechanism during regulation of potassium uptake with the KdpFABC 
transporter and may serve as a starting point for further investigations.

Absolute quantification of the Kdp subunits of Escherichia coli by multiple 
reaction monitoring.

Functional Genomics, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.

The sensor kinase/response regulator system KdpD/KdpE of Escherichia coli 
regulates the expression of the kdpFABC operon, encoding the high-affinity 
KdpFABC potassium (K(+) )-transport complex. Additionally, it has been suggested 
that the kdpDE operon itself is subjected to autoregulation by its gene products 
KdpD and KdpE. However, since kdpFABC and kdpDE expression has mainly been 
studied on the transcriptional level, accurate information on absolute amounts 
and the stoichiometric subunit composition of KdpFABC and KdpD/KdpE under K(+) 
-limiting and K(+) -nonlimiting growth conditions are lacking. In this study, we 
used highly sensitive mass spectrometric methods to quantify the amount of 
subunits of the Kdp(F)ABC complex and KdpD/KdpE. Data-dependent shotgun MS was 
used to assess protein coverage and accessible peptides. Absolute amounts of 
Kdp(F)ABC and KdpD/KdpE were quantified by targeted MRM analysis in the presence 
of corresponding heavy labeled standard peptides. Baseline synthesis of 
Kdp(F)ABC and KdpD/KdpE was found to be in the attomolar range under K(+) 
-nonlimiting conditions. Under K(+) -limitation, synthesis of Kdp(F)ABC 
(KdpA:KdpB:KdpC ratio of 1:1:1) was amplified more than 100-fold, whereas only a 
tenfold amplification of KdpD/KdpE (KdpD:KdpE ratio of 1:4) was observed. The 
results obtained provide a solid basis for follow-up studies on the dynamic 
regulation of the Kdp system.

KdpD and KdpE form a histidine kinase/response regulator system that senses K(+) 
limitation and induces the kdpFABC operon, which encodes a high-affinity K(+) 
uptake complex. To define the primary stimulus perceived by KdpD we focused in 
this study on the dynamics of the Kdp response. Escherichia coli cells were 
subjected to severe K(+) limitation, and all relevant parameters of the Kdp 
response, i.e., levels of kdpFABC transcripts and KdpFABC proteins, as well as 
extra- and intracellular K(+) concentrations, were quantitatively analysed over 
time (0 to 180 min). Unexpectedly, induction of kdpFABC was found to follow a 
non-monotonic time-course. To interpret this unusual behaviour, a mathematical 
model that adequately captures the dynamics of the Kdp system was established 
and used for simulations. We found a strong correlation between KdpD/KdpE 
activation and the intracellular K(+) concentration, which is influenced by the 
uptake of K(+) via the KdpFABC complex. Based on these results a model is 
proposed in which KdpD/KdpE phosphorylation is inversely correlated with the 
intracellular K(+) concentration. To corroborate this hypothesis an isogenic 
mutant that produces a defective KdpFABC complex, and the trans-complemented 
mutant that expresses the KtrAB high-affinity K(+) uptake system of Vibrio 
alginolyticus were quantitatively analysed. Experimental data and simulations 
for the mutants consistently support the tight correlation between KdpD/KdpE 
activation and the intracellular K(+) concentration. This study presents a 
striking example of the non-intuitive dynamics of a functional unit comprising 
signalling proteins and a transporter with K(+) as mediator.

The L-valine production strain of Escherichia coli was constructed by rational 
metabolic engineering and stepwise improvement based on transcriptome analysis 
and gene knockout simulation of the in silico genome-scale metabolic network. 
Feedback inhibition of acetohydroxy acid synthase isoenzyme III by L-valine was 
removed by site-directed mutagenesis, and the native promoter containing the 
transcriptional attenuator leader regions of the ilvGMEDA and ilvBN operon was 
replaced with the tac promoter. The ilvA, leuA, and panB genes were deleted to 
make more precursors available for L-valine biosynthesis. This engineered Val 
strain harboring a plasmid overexpressing the ilvBN genes produced 1.31 g/liter 
L-valine. Comparative transcriptome profiling was performed during batch 
fermentation of the engineered and control strains. Among the down-regulated 
genes, the lrp and ygaZH genes, which encode a global regulator Lrp and L-valine 
exporter, respectively, were overexpressed. Amplification of the lrp, ygaZH, and 
lrp-ygaZH genes led to the enhanced production of L-valine by 21.6%, 47.1%, and 
113%, respectively. Further improvement was achieved by using in silico gene 
knockout simulation, which identified the aceF, mdh, and pfkA genes as knockout 
targets. The VAMF strain (Val DeltaaceF Deltamdh DeltapfkA) overexpressing the 
ilvBN, ilvCED, ygaZH, and lrp genes was able to produce 7.55 g/liter L-valine 
from 20 g/liter glucose in batch culture, resulting in a high yield of 0.378 g 
of L-valine per gram of glucose. These results suggest that an industrially 
competitive strain can be efficiently developed by metabolic engineering based 
on combined rational modification, transcriptome profiling, and systems-level in 
silico analysis.

Solid/solution partition coefficient (Kd) and speciation of soil heavy metals 
can be used for predicting their environmental risks. The Kd values and solution 
speciation of soil Cu, Cd and Zn were analyzed in 40 samples of contaminated 
agricultural soils around Jiuhua copper mine in eastern Nanjing city, China. The 
Kd ranges (and mean values) for soil Cu, Cd and Zn are 703-7418 (3453), 
37.3-3963 (940) and 319-17965 (7244) L kg-1, respectively, showing a large 
variability both for metals and soils. The results of differential pulse anodic 
stripping voltammetry (DPASV) indicates that 95.6% solution Cu is bound to 
dissolved organic ligands. About half of the dissolved Zn is DPASV-labile at 
pH<6, while 92.1% solution Zn is in the form of organic complexes at pH>6. 
DPASV-labile Cd is ranged from 22.6 to 98.7% with the mean value of 56.3%. 
Multiple linear regressions indicate that Kd, the dissolved and DPASV-labile 
concentrations of Cd and Zn are mostly influenced by the soil solution pH with 
R2 of 0.50, 0.59 and 0.63, respectively for Cd, and 0.58, 0.72 and 0.64, 
respectively for Zn. Considering the second parameter of corresponding soil 
metal, the linear relationships of Kd with pH were improved with R2 of 0.70 and 
0.73 for Cd and Zn, respectively. However, the solubility of soil Cu was 
insensitive to pH. Only SOC shows a weak relationship to the dissolved Cu with 
R2 of 0.21. As for its Kd, total soil Cu is the most significant factor. But for 
DPASV-labile Cu, no soil parameters were found to be good predictors.

The leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) acts as a specific repressor for 
sigma s-dependent transcription of the Escherichia coli aidB gene.

Author information:

Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655, USA.

The product of the Escherichia coli aidB gene is homologous to human 
isovaleryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (IVD), an enzyme involved in the breakdown 
of the amino acid leucine. The aidB gene is not expressed constitutively, but 
its transcription is induced via distinct mechanisms in response to: (i) 
exposure to alkylating agents; (ii) acetate at a slightly acidic pH; and (iii) 
anoxia. Induction by alkylating agents is mediated by the transcriptional 
activator Ada, in its methylated form (meAda); the other forms of induction are 
Ada independent and require sigma s, the alternative sigma factor mainly 
expressed during the stationary phase of bacterial growth. In this report we 
show that, in the absence of any transcriptional factor, aidB is efficiently 
transcribed in vitro by the sigma s, but not by the sigma 70, form of RNA 
polymerase holoenzyme. In the presence of meAda, levels of transcription by both 
forms of RNA polymerase are significantly increased. However, sigma s-dependent 
transcription of aidB is inhibited both in vitro and in vivo by binding of the 
transcriptional regulator Lrp (leucine responsive protein) to the aidB promoter 
region (PaidB). Lrp acts as a specific repressor for sigma s-dependent 
transcription of aidB. Leucine counteracts Lrp binding to P aidB, as does 
binding to P aidB of me Ada, which causes Lrp to dissociate from the promoter. 
The physiological significance of aidB transcription regulation is discussed.

Alterations in the flow of one-carbon units affect KinB-dependent sporulation in 
Bacillus subtilis.

Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA. vdartois@pasteur.fr

Endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis is primarily dependent on the 
phosphorylation of the key transcription factor Spo0A by two major kinases, KinA 
and KinB, thought to be activated by distinct signals. Using a strategy designed 
to detect mutations that specifically affect the signalling pathway to KinB, we 
have isolated a Tn10 insertion mutant in one of two adjacent lrp-like genes 
coding for homologues of the Escherichia coli leucine-responsive regulatory 
protein (Lrp) and another mutant in the glyA gene encoding the serine 
hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT). SHMT catalyses interconversion of serine and 
glycine while transferring the resulting one-carbon unit into the C1 pool 
through methylene tetrahydrofolate. Sporulation experiments performed in a 
series of supplemented media indicated that the role of SHMT in the KinB pathway 
is to feed the pool of C1 units recruited for the biosynthesis of key 
metabolites, which include the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). The 
results of experiments using L-ethionine suggest that SAM is involved in 
post-synthetic methylation reactions or biosynthesis of metabolites that serve 
to activate KinB. Truncated LrpA and LrpB peptides that have retained the 
DNA-binding domain but have lost the C-terminal half of the protein appear to 
act as repressors of glyA transcription and KinB-dependent sporulation. However, 
deletions of lrpA, lrpB or lrpAB have little effect on glyA transcription or 
sporulation through KinB, suggesting that other effectors, such as additional 
Lrp homologues, may act in conjunction with LrpA and LrpB. Our results indicate 
that lrpA-lrpB together with the biosynthetic glyA gene lie on a common 
signalling pathway meant to activate the KinB sensor kinase.

The role of H-NS in one carbon metabolism.

Landgraf JR(1), Levinthal M, Danchin A.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, W Lafayette, IN 47907, 
USA.

The H-NS protein of Escherichia coli regulates the expression of genes involved 
in many general processes such as osmoregulation and virulence. More recently, 
H-NS was shown to exert an effect on ilvIH gene expression in conjunction with 
the leucine responsive regulatory protein (Lrp). We show that H-NS is involved 
in the transcriptional regulation of the kbl/tdh operon, which is also Lrp 
regulated. Insertional inactivation of the hns gene results in two-fold 
derepression of the kbl/tdh operon. This level of expression is sufficient to 
suppress the auxotrophic requirements imposed by a glyA mutation. We show that 
expression of the kbl/tdh operon is temperature controlled and that this control 
is not mediated through H-NS action as has been shown for some other temperature 
controlled genes.

phase-variable uropathogen-associated pyelonephritis-associated pilus (pap) 
genetic switch. Since then, important data have come to light, including 
additional factors that regulate pap expression, better characterization of H-NS 
regulation, the structure of the Lrp octamer in complex with pap regulatory DNA, 
the temperature-insensitive phenotype of a mutant lacking the acetyltransferase 
RimJ, evidence that key components of the regulatory machinery are acetylated, 
and new insights into the role of DNA binding by key regulators in shaping both 
the physical structure and regulatory state of the papI and papBA promoters. 
This review revisits pap, integrating these newer observations with older ones 
to produce a new model for the concerted behavior of this virulence-regulatory 
region.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a major burden to human health. The 
overwhelming majority of UTIs are caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli 
(UPEC) strains. Unlike some pathogens, UPEC strains do not have a fixed core set 
of virulence and fitness factors but do have a variety of adhesins and 
regulatory pathways. One such UPEC adhesin is the nonfimbrial adhesin TosA, 
which mediates adherence to the epithelium of the upper urinary tract. The tos 
operon is AT rich, resides on pathogenicity island aspV, and is not expressed 
under laboratory conditions. Because of this, we hypothesized that tosA 
expression is silenced by H-NS. Lrp, based on its prominent function in the 
regulation of other adhesins, is also hypothesized to contribute to tos operon 
regulation. Using a variety of in vitro techniques, we mapped both the tos 
operon promoter and TosR binding sites. We have now identified TosR as a dual 
regulator of the tos operon, which could control the tos operon in association 
with H-NS and Lrp. H-NS is a negative regulator of the tos operon, and Lrp 
positively regulates the tos operon. Exogenous leucine also inhibits 
Lrp-mediated tos operon positive regulation. In addition, TosR binds to the pap 
operon, which encodes another important UPEC adhesin, P fimbria. Induction of 
TosR synthesis reduces production of P fimbria. These studies advance our 
knowledge of regulation of adhesin expression associated with uropathogen 
colonization of a host.

FimB and FimE are site-specific recombinases, part of the lambda integrase 
family, and invert a 314 bp DNA switch that controls the expression of type 1 
fimbriae in Escherichia coli. FimB and FimE differ in their activity towards the 
fim switch, with FimB catalysing inversion in both directions in comparison to 
the higher-frequency but unidirectional on-to-off recombination catalysed by 
FimE. Previous work has demonstrated that FimB, but not FimE, recombination is 
completely inhibited in vitro and in vivo by a regulator, PapB, expressed from a 
distinct fimbrial locus. The aim of this work was to investigate differences 
between FimB and FimE activity by exploiting the differential inhibition 
demonstrated by PapB. The research focused on genetic changes to the fim switch 
that alter recombinase binding and its structural context. FimB and FimE still 
recombined a switch in which the majority of fimS DNA was replaced with a larger 
region of non-fim DNA. This demonstrated a minimal requirement for FimB and FimE 
recombination of the Fim binding sites and associated inverted repeats. With the 
original leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and integration host factor 
(IHF)-dependent structure removed, PapB was now able to inhibit both 
recombinases. The relative affinities of FimB and FimE were determined for the 
four 'half sites'. This analysis, along with the effect of extensive swaps and 
duplications of the half sites on recombination frequency, demonstrated that 
FimB recruitment and therefore subsequent activity was dependent on a single 
half site and its context, whereas FimE recombination was less stringent, being 
able to interact initially with two half sites with equally high affinity. While 
increasing FimB recombination frequencies failed to overcome PapB repression, 
mutations made in recombinase binding sites resulted in inhibition of FimE 
recombination by PapB. Overall, the data support a model in which the 
recombinases differ in loading order and co-operative interactions. PapB 
exploits this difference and FimE becomes susceptible when its normal loading is 
restricted or changed.

In uropathogenic Escherichia coli, P pili (Pap) facilitate binding to host 
epithelial cells and subsequent colonization. Whereas P pili can be produced at 
37 degrees C, the expression of these fimbriae is suppressed at 23 degrees C. 
Previously, insertion mutations in rimJ, a gene encoding the N-terminal 
acetyltransferase of ribosomal protein S5, were shown to disrupt this 
thermoregulatory response, allowing papBA transcription at low temperature. In 
this study, we created an in-frame deletion of rimJ. This deletion relieved the 
repressive effects not only of low temperature but also of rich (Luria-Bertani 
[LB]) medium and glucose on papBA transcription, indicating that RimJ modulates 
papBA transcription in response to multiple environmental stimuli. papI 
transcription was also shown to be regulated by RimJ. papBA transcription is 
also controlled by a phase variation mechanism. We demonstrated that the 
regulators necessary to establish a phase ON state--PapI, PapB, Dam, Lrp, and 
cyclic AMP-CAP-are still required for papBA transcription in a rimJ mutant 
strain. rimJ mutations increase the rate at which bacteria transition into the 
phase ON state, indicating that RimJ inhibits the phase OFF-->ON transition. A 
DeltarimJ hns651 mutant is viable on LB medium but not on minimal medium. This 
synthetic lethality, along with transcriptional analyses, indicates that RimJ 
and H-NS work through separate pathways to control papBA transcription. 
Mutations in rimJ do not greatly influence the transcription of the fan, daa, or 
fim operon, suggesting that RimJ may be a pap-specific regulator. Overexpression 
of rimJ under conditions repressive for papBA transcription complements the 
DeltarimJ mutation but has little effect on transcription under activating 
conditions, indicating that the ability of RimJ to regulate transcription is 
environmentally controlled.

The essential role of the promoter-proximal subunit of CAP in pap phase

Catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) is essential for the expression of Pap 
pili by uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses 
indicate that binding of cAMP-CAP centred at 215.5 bp upstream of the papBA 
promoter is essential for activation of transcription. CAP-dependent activation 
of papBA requires binding of the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) at 
binding sites that extend from -180 to -149 relative to the start site of papBA. 
Our data indicate that CAP and Lrp bind independently to their respective pap 
DNA sites. Activation of papBA transcription was eliminated by mutations in the 
activating region 1 (AR1) of CAP, but not in the AR2 region, similar to class I 
CAP-dependent promoters. Also, like class I promoters, the C-terminal domain of 
the alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase appears to play a role in transcription 
activation. Moreover, phase variation is strictly dependent upon the helical 
phase of the CAP DNA binding site with respect to the papBA transcription start 
site. Using an 'oriented heterodimer' approach with wild-type and AR1 mutant 
CAPs, it was shown that the AR1 region of the CAP subunit proximal to papBA is 
required for stimulation of papBA transcription, whereas AR1 of the 
promoter-distal subunit is not. Previously, CAP was hypothesized to activate pap 
transcription indirectly by disrupting repression mediated by H-NS. The results 
presented here show that AR1 of the promoter-proximal CAP subunit was required 
for papBA transcription even in the absence of the histone-like protein H-NS. 
These results show that the promoter-proximal subunit of CAP, bound 215.5 bp 
upstream of the papBA transcription start site, plays an active role in 
stimulating papBA transcription, possibly by interacting with the C-terminal 
domain of the alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase.

The DNA relaxation-dependent OFF-to-ON biasing of the type 1 fimbrial genetic 
switch requires the Fis nucleoid-associated protein.

The structural genes expressing type 1 fimbriae in Escherichia coli alternate 
between expressed (phase ON) and non-expressed (phase OFF) states due to 
inversion of the 314 bp fimS genetic switch. The FimB tyrosine integrase inverts 
fimS by site-specific recombination, alternately connecting and disconnecting 
the fim operon, encoding the fimbrial subunit protein and its associated 
secretion and adhesin factors, to and from its transcriptional promoter within 
fimS. Site-specific recombination by the FimB recombinase becomes biased towards 
phase ON as DNA supercoiling is relaxed, a condition that occurs when bacteria 
approach the stationary phase of the growth cycle. This effect can be mimicked 
in exponential phase cultures by inhibiting the negative DNA supercoiling 
activity of DNA gyrase. We report that this bias towards phase ON depends on the 
presence of the Fis nucleoid-associated protein. We mapped the Fis binding to a 
site within the invertible fimS switch by DNase I footprinting. Disruption of 
this binding site by base substitution mutagenesis abolishes both Fis binding 
and the ability of the mutated switch to sustain its phase ON bias when DNA is 
relaxed, even in bacteria that produce the Fis protein. In addition, the Fis 
binding site overlaps one of the sites used by the Lrp protein, a known 
directionality determinant of fimS inversion that also contributes to phase ON 
bias. The Fis–Lrp relationship at fimS is reminiscent of that between Fis and 
Xis when promoting DNA relaxation-dependent excision of bacteriophage λ from the 
E. coli chromosome. However, unlike the co-binding mechanism used by Fis and Xis 
at λ attR, the Fis–Lrp relationship at fimS involves competitive binding. We 
discuss these findings in the context of the link between fimS inversion biasing 
and the physiological state of the bacterium.

DNA relaxation-dependent phase biasing of the fim genetic switch in Escherichia 
coli depends on the interplay of H-NS, IHF and LRP.

Genetics and Microbiology, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.

Reversible inversion of the DNA element fimS is responsible for the phase 
variable expression of type 1 fimbriae in Escherichia coli. The FimB tyrosine 
integrase site-specific recombinase inverts fimS in the on-to-off and off-to-on 
directions with approximately equal efficiencies. However, when DNA supercoiling 
is relaxed, fimS adopts predominantly the on orientation. This orientational 
bias is known to require binding of the nucleoid-associated protein LRP within 
fimS. Here we show that binding of the IHF protein to a site immediately 
adjacent to fimS is also required for phase-on orientational bias. In the 
absence of both LRP and IHF binding, fimS adopts the off orientation and the 
H-NS protein is required to maintain this alternative orientational bias. Thus, 
fimS has three Recombination Directionality Factors, H-NS, IHF and LRP. The 
relevant H-NS binding site straddles the left inverted repeat in phase-off fimS 
and this site is disrupted when fimS inverts to the on orientation. The 
inversion of fimS with the associated creation and removal of an H-NS binding 
site required for DNA inversion biasing represents a novel mechanism for 
modulating the interaction of H-NS with a DNA target and for influencing a 
site-specific recombination reaction.

Type 1 fimbriae are a crucial factor for the virulence of uropathogenic 
Escherichia coli during the first steps of infection by mediating adhesion to 
epithelial cells. They are also required for the consequent colonization of the 
tissues and for invasion of the uroepithelium. Here, we studied the role of the 
specialized signal transduction system CRP-cAMP in the regulation of type 1 
fimbriation. Although initially discovered by regulating carbohydrate 
metabolism, the CRP-cAMP complex controls a major regulatory network in 
Gram-negative bacteria, including a broad subset of genes spread into different 
functional categories of the cell. Our results indicate that CRP-cAMP plays a 
dual role in type 1 fimbriation, affecting both the phase variation process and 
fimA promoter activity, with an overall repressive outcome on fimbriation. The 
dissection of the regulatory pathway let us conclude that CRP-cAMP negatively 
affects FimB-mediated recombination by an indirect mechanism that requires DNA 
gyrase activity. Moreover, the underlying studies revealed that CRP-cAMP 
controls the expression of another global regulator in Gram-negative bacteria, 
the leucine-responsive protein Lrp. CRP-cAMP-mediated repression is limiting the 
switch from the non-fimbriated to the fimbriated state. Consistently, a drop in 
the intracellular concentration of cAMP due to altered physiological conditions 
(e.g. growth in presence of glucose) increases the percentage of fimbriated 
cells in the bacterial population. We also provide evidence that the repression 
of type 1 fimbriae by CRP-cAMP occurs during fast growth conditions (logarithmic 
phase) and is alleviated during slow growth (stationary phase), which is 
consistent with an involvement of type 1 fimbriae in the adaptation to stress 
conditions by promoting biofilm growth or entry into host cells. Our work 
suggests that the metabolic sensor CRP-cAMP plays a role in coupling the 
expression of type 1 fimbriae to environmental conditions, thereby also 
affecting subsequent attachment and colonization of host tissues.

Regulation of Fimbrial Expression.

Blomfield I, van der Woude M.

Fimbria-mediated interaction with the host elicits both innate and adaptive 
immune responses, and thus their expression may not always be beneficial in 
vivo. Furthermore, the metabolic drain of producing fimbriae is significant. It 
is not surprising, therefore, to find that fimbrial production in Escherichia 
coli and Salmonella enterica is under extensive environmental regulation. In 
many instances, fimbrial expression is regulated by phase variation, in which 
individual cells are capable of switching between fimbriate and afimbriate 
states to produce a mixed population. Mechanisms of phase variation vary 
considerably between different fimbriae and involve both genetic and epigenetic 
processes. Notwithstanding this, fimbrial expression is also sometimes 
controlled at the posttranscriptional level. In this chapter, we review key 
features of the regulation of fimbrial gene expression in E. coli and 
Salmonella. The occurrence and distribution of fimbrial operons vary 
significantly among E. coli pathovars and even among the many Salmonella 
serovars. Therefore, general principles are presented on the basis of detailed 
discussion of paradigms that have been extensively studied, including Pap, type 
1 fimbriae, and curli. The roles of operon specific regulators like FimB or CsgD 
and of global regulatory proteins like Lrp, CpxR, and the histone-like proteins 
H-NS and IHF are reviewed as are the roles of sRNAs and of signalling nucleotide 
cyclic-di-GMP. Individual examples are discussed in detail to illustrate how the 
regulatory factors cooperate to allow tight control of expression of single 
operons. Molecular networks that allow coordinated expression between multiple 
fimbrial operons and with flagella in a single isolate are also presented. This 
chapter illustrates how adhesin expression is controlled, and the model systems 
also illustrate general regulatory principles germane to our overall 
understanding of bacterial gene regulation.

DNA supercoiling and the Lrp protein determine the directionality of fim switch 
DNA inversion in Escherichia coli K-12.

Site-specific recombinases of the integrase family usually require cofactors to 
impart directionality in the recombination reactions that they catalyze. The 
FimB integrase inverts the Escherichia coli fim switch (fimS) in the on-to-off 
and off-to-on directions with approximately equal efficiency. Inhibiting DNA 
gyrase with novobiocin caused inversion to become biased in the off-to-on 
direction. This directionality was not due to differential DNA topological 
distortion of fimS in the on and off phases by the activity of its resident 
P(fimA) promoter. Instead, the leucine-responsive regulatory (Lrp) protein was 
found to determine switching outcomes. Knocking out the lrp gene or abolishing 
Lrp binding sites 1 and 2 within fimS completely reversed the response of the 
switch to DNA relaxation. Inactivation of either Lrp site alone resulted in mild 
on-to-off bias, showing that they act together to influence the response of the 
switch to changes in DNA supercoiling. Thus, Lrp is not merely an architectural 
element organizing the fim invertasome, it collaborates with DNA supercoiling to 
determine the directionality of the DNA inversion event.

Modulation of the sensitivity of FimB recombination to branched-chain amino 
acids and alanine in Escherichia coli K-12.

Kingdom.

Phase variation of type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli requires the 
site-specific recombination of a short invertible element. Inversion is 
catalyzed by FimB (switching in either direction) or FimE (inversion mainly from 
on to off) and is influenced by auxiliary factors integration host factor (IHF) 
and leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp). These proteins bind to sites 
(IHF site II and Lrp sites 1 and 2) within the invertible element to stimulate 
recombination, presumably by bending the DNA to enhance synapses. Interaction of 
Lrp with a third site (site 3) cooperatively with sites 1 and 2 (termed complex 
1) impedes recombination. Inversion is stimulated by the branched-chain amino 
acids (particularly leucine) and alanine, and according to a current model, the 
amino acids promote the selective loss of Lrp from site 3 (complex 2). Here we 
show that the central portion of the fim invertible element, situated between 
Lrp site 3 and IHF site II, is dispensable for FimB recombination but that this 
region is also required for full amino acid stimulation of inversion. Further 
work reveals that the region is likely to contain multiple regulatory elements. 
Lrp site 3 is shown to bind the regulatory protein with low affinity, and a 
mutation that enhances binding to this element is found both to diminish the 
stimulatory effects of IVLA on FimB recombination and to inhibit recombination 
in the absence of the amino acids. The results obtained emphasize the importance 
of Lrp site 3 as a control element but also highlight the complexity of the 
regulatory system that affects this site.

Distant cis-active sequences and sialic acid control the expression of fimB in 
Escherichia coli K-12.

The phase variation of type 1 fimbriation in Escherichia coli is controlled by 
the inversion of a 314 bp element of DNA, determined by FimB (switching in both 
directions) or FimE (switching from the ON-to-OFF orientation predominantly), 
and influenced by auxiliary factors IHF, Lrp and H-NS. The fimB gene is 
separated from the divergently transcribed yjhATS operon by a large (1.4 kbp) 
intergenic region of unknown function. Here, we show that fimB expression is 
regulated by multiple cis-active sequences that lie far upstream (>600 bp) of 
the transcription start sites for the recombinase gene. Two regions 
characterized further (regions 1 and 2) show sequence identity, and each 
coincides with a methylation-protected Dam (5'-GATC) site. Regions 1 and 2 
apparently control fimB expression by an antirepression mechanism that involves 
additional sequences proximal to yjhA. Region 1 encompasses a 27 bp DNA sequence 
conserved upstream of genes known (nanAT ) or suspected (yjhBC) to be involved 
in sialic acid metabolism, and we show that FimB expression and recombination 
are suppressed by N-acetylneuraminic acid. We propose that E. coli recognizes 
the amino sugars as a harbinger of potential host defence activation, and 
suppresses the expression of type 1 fimbriae in response.

Leucine alters the interaction of the leucine-responsive regulatory protein 
(Lrp) with the fim switch to stimulate site-specific recombination in 
Escherichia coli.

Center, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1064, USA.

The leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) is a global regulator that 
controls the expression of numerous operons in Escherichia coli. Lrp can act as 
a repressor or as an activator of transcription with its effects being 
potentiated, repressed or unaffected by the presence of exogenous leucine. The 
phase variation of type 1 fimbria in E. coli provides a unique system in which 
to investigate the effects of leucine on Lrp, as it is the only known example in 
which Lrp is a positive regulator and leucine potentiates this effect. Previous 
studies determined that Lrp binds with high affinity to two sites within the fim 
switch (fim sites 1 and 2), and binding to these sites stimulates recombination. 
Here, it is shown that, even though leucine stimulates the fim switch in vivo, 
it nevertheless causes a slight decrease in Lrp binding to the fim switch in 
vitro. These contradictory results are explicable by the finding that Lrp 
binding to a third region adjacent to fim sites 1 and 2 inhibits recombination. 
According to this model, leucine stimulates recombination by selectively 
disrupting Lrp binding to this newly characterized region, while having little 
or no effect on Lrp binding to fim sites 1 and 2.

Escherichia coli.

The site-specific DNA inversion that controls phase variation of type 1 
fimbriation in E. coli is catalysed by two recombinases, FimB and FimE. 
Efficient inversion by either recombinase also requires the leucine-responsive 
regulatory protein (Lrp). In addition, FimB recombination is stimulated by the 
integration host factor (IHF). The effect of IHF on FimE inversion has not 
previously been reported. Here it is shown that IHF stimulates FimE 
recombination; In strain MG1655, mutants containing lesions in either the alpha 
(ihfA) or beta (ihfB) subunits of IHF show a marked decrease in both FimB- 
(100-fold) and FimE (15,000-fold)-promoted switching. IHF is shown to bind with 
high affinity to sites both adjacent to (site I) and within (site II) the fim 
invertible element. Furthermore, mutations in site I or site II that lower the 
affinity of IHF binding In vitro were found to lower the frequency of FimE and/ 
or FimB recombination in vivo. Although site I and site II mutations in 
combination have an effect on FimB-promoted switching comparable to that of IHF 
knockout mutations (100-fold), the cis site mutations have a much less marked 
effect (100-fold) on FimE-promoted switching.

A new antibacterial strategy based on inhibiting bacterial quorum sensing (QS) 
has emerged as a promising method of attenuating bacterial pathogenicity and 
preventing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. In this study, we screened 
Echinatin (Ech) with high-efficiency anti-QS from 13 flavonoids through the AI-2 
bioluminescence assay. Additionally, crystal violet (CV) staining combined with 
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to evaluate the effect of 
anti-biofilm against Escherichia coli (E. coli). Further, the antibacterial 
synergistic effect of Ech and marketed antibiotics were measured by broth 
dilution and Alamar Blue Assay. It was found that Ech interfered with the 
phenotype of QS, including biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide (EPS) 
production, and motility, without affecting bacterial growth and metabolic 
activity. Moreover, qRT-PCR exhibited that Ech significantly reduced the 
expression of QS-regulated genes (luxS, pfs, lsrB, lsrK, lsrR, flhC, flhD, fliC, 
csgD, and stx2). More important, Ech with currently marketed colistin 
antibiotics (including colistin B and colistin E) showed significantly 
synergistically increased antibacterial activity in overcoming antibiotic 
resistance of E. coli. In summary, these results suggested the potent anti-QS 
and novel antibacterial synergist candidate of Ech for treating E. coli 
infections.

As an opportunistic pathogen, Escherichia coli (E. coli) forms biofilm that 
increases the virulence of bacteria and antibiotic resistance, posing a serious 
threat to human and animal health. Recently, ginkgetin (Gin) has been discovered 
to have antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor properties. In the present 
study, we evaluated the antibiofilm and antibacterial synergist of Gin against 
E. coli. Additionally, Alamar Blue assay combined with confocal laser scanning 
microscope (CLSM) and crystal violet (CV) staining was used to evaluate the 
effect of antibiofilm and antibacterial synergist against E. coli. Results 
showed that Gin reduces biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, 
and motility against E. coli without limiting its growth and metabolic activity. 
Furthermore, we identified the inhibitory effect of Gin on AI-2 signaling 
molecule production, which showed apparent anti-quorum sensing (QS) properties. 
The qRT-PCR also indicated that Gin reduced the transcription of curli-related 
genes (csgA, csgD), flagella-formation genes (flhC, flhD, fliC, fliM), and 
QS-related genes (luxS, lsrB, lsrK, lsrR). Moreover, Gin showed obvious 
antibacterial synergism to overcome antibiotic resistance in E. coli with 
marketed antibiotics, including gentamicin, colistin B, and colistin E. These 
results suggested the potent antibiofilm and novel antibacterial synergist 
effect of Gin for treating E. coli infections.

Shiga toxins and intimate adhesion controlled by the locus of enterocyte 
effacement are major enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) virulence 
factors. Curli fimbriae also contribute to cell adhesion and are essential 
biofilm components. The transcriptional regulator PchE represses the expression 
of curli and their adhesion to HEp-2 cells. Past studies indicate that pchE also 
represses additional adhesins that contribute to HEp-2 cell attachment. In this 
study, we tested for pchE regulation of several tissue adhesins and their 
regulators. Three adhesin-encoding genes (eae, lpfA1, fliC) and four master 
regulators (csgD, stpA, ler, flhDC) were controlled by pchE. pchE 
over-expression strongly up-regulated fliC but the marked flagella induction 
reduced the attachment of O157:H7 clinical isolate PA20 to HEp-2 cells, 
indicating that flagella were blocking cell attachments rather than functioning 
as an adhesin. Chemotaxis, motor, structural, and regulatory genes in the 
flagellar operons were all increased by pchE expression, as was PA20 motility. 
This study identifies new members in the pchE regulon and shows that pchE 
stimulates flagellar motility while repressing cell adhesion, likely to support 
EHEC movement to the intestinal surface early in infection. However, induced or 
inappropriate pchE-dependent flagellar expression could block cell attachments 
later during disease progression.

Most Escherichia coli strains are innocuous to human beings; however, some 
strains can cause diarrhea and are grouped into pathotypes. Since current trends 
promote the use of natural-origin compounds to control bacteria, in this study, 
the effects of the phenolic compounds (PCs) tannic acid (TA), gallic acid (GA), 
methyl gallate (MG), and epigallocatechin gallate (EG) on the growth, swarming 
motility, biofilm formation, and expression of selected virulence genes of three 
E. coli pathotypes (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [EPEC], enterohemorrhagic 
Escherichia coli [EHEC], and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [ETEC]) were 
evaluated. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined by using 
microtiter plates, and the effects of sublethal PC concentrations on swarming 
motility were evaluated on Luria-Bertani agar. Biofilm formation was assessed in 
microtiter plates via crystal violet staining, and the expression levels of 
genes involved in biofilm formation (flhC, fliA, fliC, and csgA) and swarming 
motility (csgD and cyaA) were evaluated via quantitative PCR. All PC were 
bactericidal with minimal bactericidal concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 
2.1 mg/mL. At concentrations lower than the MBC, PCs decreased swarming motility 
(14.8-100%). GA reduced biofilm formation in all of the tested strains; however, 
TA, MG, and EG induced biofilm formation in some strains at specific 
concentrations. TA induced the overexpression of csgA, csgD, and cyaA, whereas 
the other PCs did not have any effects or reduced their expression levels. The 
PCs tested in this study showed potential to control E. coli strains belonging 
to the EHEC, ETEC, and EPEC pathotypes by affecting their growth, swarming 
motility, and virulence gene expression; however, proper concentrations must be 
used to avoid the induction of undesirable virulence factor genes.

Atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli are capable to form biofilm on biotic 
and abiotic surfaces, regardless of the adherence pattern displayed. Several E. 
coli mechanisms are regulated by Quorum sensing (QS), including virulence 
factors and biofilm formation. Quorum sensing is a signaling system that confers 
bacteria with the ability to respond to chemical molecules known as 
autoinducers. Suppressor of division inhibitor (SdiA) is a QS receptor present 
in atypical enteropathogenic E.coli (aEPEC) that detects acyl homoserine lactone 
(AHL) type autoinducers. However, these bacteria do not encode an AHL synthase, 
but they are capable of sensing AHL molecules produced by other species, 
establishing an inter-species bacterial communication. In this study, we 
performed experiments to evaluate pellicle, ring-like structure and biofilm 
formation on wild type, sdiA mutants and complemented strains. We also evaluated 
the transcription of genes involved in different stages of biofilm formation, 
such as bcsA, csgA, csgD, fliC and fimA. The sdiA mutants were capable of 
forming thicker biofilm structures and showed increased motility when compared 
to wild type and complemented strains. Moreover, they also showed denser 
pellicles and ring-like structures. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) 
analysis demonstrated increased csgA, csgD and fliC transcription on mutant 
strains. Biofilm formation, as well as csgD, csgA and fimA transcription 
decreased on wild type strains by the addition of AHL. These results indicate 
that SdiA participates on the regulation of these phenotypes in aEPEC and that 
AHL addition enhances the repressor effect of this receptor on the transcription 
of biofilm and motility related genes.

Although molecular mechanisms promoting adherence of enterohemorrhagic 
Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 on epithelial cells are well characterized, 
regulatory mechanisms controlling biofilm formation are not fully understood. In 
this study, we demonstrate that biofilm formation in EHEC O157:H7 strain 86-24 
is highly repressed compared to that in an isogenic hha mutant. The hha mutant 
produced large quantities of biofilm compared to the wild-type strain at 30°C 
and 37°C. Complementation of the hha mutant reduced the level of biofilm 
formation to that of the wild-type strain, indicating that Hha is a negative 
regulator of biofilm production. While swimming motility and expression of the 
flagellar gene fliC were significantly reduced, the expression of csgA (encoding 
curlin of curli fimbriae) and the ability to bind Congo red were significantly 
enhanced. The expression of both fliC and csgA and the phenotypes of motility 
and curli production affected by these two genes, respectively, were restored to 
wild-type levels in the complemented hha mutant. The csgA deletion abolished 
biofilm formation in the hha mutant and wild-type strain, and csgA 
complementation restored biofilm formation to these strains, indicating the 
importance of csgA and curli in biofilm formation. The regulatory effects of Hha 
on flagellar and curli gene expression appear to occur via the induction and 
repression of FlhDC and CsgD, as demonstrated by reduced flhD and increased csgD 
transcription in the hha mutant, respectively. In gel shift assays Hha 
interacted with flhDC and csgD promoters. In conclusion, Hha regulates biofilm 
formation in EHEC O157:H7 by differential regulation of FlhDC and CsgD, the 
global regulators of motility and curli production, respectively.

Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) is the main pathogens that inflict the 
poultry industry. Biofilm as the pathogenic factors of APEC, which can enhance 
the anti-host immune system of APEC and improve its survival in the environment. 
In order to screen for new genes related to APEC biofilm. The APEC strain APEC81 
was used to construct a mutant library by Tn5 insertion mutagenesis. Moreover 
the 28 mutant strains with severely weakened biofilm were successfully screened 
from 1500 mutant strains by crystal violet staining, in which 17 genes were 
obtained by high-efficiency thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR. The reported 
genes include 3 flagella genes (fliS, fliD, and fliR), 4 curli fimbriae genes 
(csgD, csgA, csgF, and csgG) and 3 type 1 fimbriae genes (fimA, fimD, and fimC). 
The novel genes include 3 coenzyme genes (gltA, bglX, and mltF) and 4 putative 
protein genes (yehE, 07045, 11735, 11255). To investigate whether these 17 genes 
co-regulate the biofilm, the 17 identified genes were deleted from APEC strain 
APEC81. The results showed that except for the 11735 and 11255 genes, the 
deletion of 15 genes significantly reduced the biofilm formation ability of 
APEC81 (P < 0.05). The result of rdar (red, dry and rough) colony morphology 
showed that curli fimbriae genes (csgD, csgA, csgF, and csgG) and other 
functional genes (fimC, glxK, yehE, 07045, and 11255) affected the colony 
morphology. In particular, the hypothetical protein YehE had the greatest 
influence on the biofilm. It was predicted to have the same structure as the 
type 1 fimbria protein. When yehE was deleted, the fimE transcription was 
up-regulated, and the fimA and fimB transcription were down-regulated, resulting 
in a decrease in type 1 fimbriae. Hence, the yehE mutant significantly reduced 
the biofilm and the adhesion and invasion ability to cells (P < 0.05). This 
study identified 5 novel genes (gltA, bglX, mltF, yehE, and 07045) related to 
biofilm formation and confirmed that yehE affects biofilm formation by type 1 
fimbriae, which will benefit further study of the mechanism of biofilm 
regulation in APEC.

CsgD, the master regulator of biofilm formation, activates the synthesis of 
curli fimbriae and extracellular polysaccharides in Escherichia coli. To obtain 
insights into its regulatory role, we have identified a total of 20 novel 
regulation target genes on the E. coli genome by using chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip analysis with a high-density DNA microarray. 
By DNase I footprinting, the consensus CsgD-binding sequence predicted from a 
total of 18 target sites was found to include AAAAGNG(N(2))AAAWW. After a 
promoter-lacZ fusion assay, the CsgD targets were classified into two groups: 
group I genes, such as fliE and yhbT, are repressed by CsgD, while group II 
genes, including yccT and adrA, are activated by CsgD. The fliE and fliEFGH 
operons for flagellum formation are directly repressed by CsgD, while CsgD 
activates the adrA gene, which encodes an enzyme for synthesis of cyclic di-GMP, 
a bacterial second messenger, which in turn inhibits flagellum production and 
rotation. Taking these findings together, we propose that the cell motility for 
planktonic growth is repressed by CsgD, thereby promoting the switch to biofilm 
formation.

The development of acid tolerance response (ATR) as a result of low pH in 
Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) contaminating beef during processing 
is considered a major food safety concern. Thus, in order to explore the 
formation and molecular mechanisms of the tolerance response of E. coli O157:H7 
in a simulated beef processing environment, the resistance of a wild-type (WT) 
strain and its corresponding ΔphoP mutant to acid, heat, and osmotic pressure 
was evaluated. Strains were pre-adapted under different conditions of pH (5.4 
and 7.0), temperature (37 °C and 10 °C), and culture medium (meat extract and 
Luria-Bertani broth media). In addition, the expression of genes related to 
stress response and virulence was also investigated among WT and ΔphoP strains 
under the tested conditions. Pre-acid adaptation increased the resistance of E. 
coli O157:H7 to acid and heat treatment while resistance to osmotic pressure 
decreased. Moreover, acid adaptation in meat extract medium simulating slaughter 
environment increased ATR, whereas pre-adaptation at 10 °C reduced the ATR. 
Furthermore, it was shown that mildly acidic conditions (pH = 5.4) and the 
PhoP/PhoQ two-component system (TCS) acted synergistically to enhance acid and 
heat tolerance in E. coli O157:H7. Additionally, the expression of genes related 
to arginine and lysine metabolism, heat shock, and invasiveness was 
up-regulated, which revealed that the mechanism of acid resistance and 
cross-protection under mildly acidic conditions was mediated by the PhoP/PhoQ 
TCS. Both acid adaptation and phoP gene knockout reduced the relative expression 
of stx1 and stx2 genes which were considered as critical pathogenic factors. 
Collectively, the current findings indicated that ATR could occur in E. coli 
O157:H7 during beef processing. Thus, there is an increased food safety risk due 
to the persistence of tolerance response in the following processing conditions. 
The present study provides a more comprehensive basis for the effective 
application of hurdle technology in beef processing.

Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are widespread types of protein 
machinery, typically consisting of a histidine kinase membrane sensor and a 
cytoplasmic transcriptional regulator that can sense and respond to 
environmental signals. TCSs are responsible for modulating genes involved in a 
multitude of bacterial functions, including cell division, motility, 
differentiation, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and virulence. 
Pathogenic bacteria exploit the capabilities of TCSs to reprogram gene 
expression according to the different niches they encounter during host 
infection. This review focuses on the role of TCSs in regulating the virulence 
phenotype of Shigella, an intracellular pathogen responsible for severe human 
enteric syndrome. The pathogenicity of Shigella is the result of the complex 
action of a wide number of virulence determinants located on the chromosome and 
on a large virulence plasmid. In particular, we will discuss how five TCSs, 
EnvZ/OmpR, CpxA/CpxR, ArcB/ArcA, PhoQ/PhoP, and EvgS/EvgA, contribute to linking 
environmental stimuli to the expression of genes related to virulence and 
fitness within the host. Considering the relevance of TCSs in the expression of 
virulence in pathogenic bacteria, the identification of drugs that inhibit TCS 
function may represent a promising approach to combat bacterial infections.

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli isolates (n = 50) were recovered from 
aquatic ecosystems, which presented high counts of E. coli and metal values 
within the recommended range. These isolates showed different multidrug 
resistance profiles, highlighting the resistance to extended-spectrum 
cephalosporins, polymyxins, and fluoroquinolones. Several antimicrobial 
resistance genes (ARGs) were found, spotlighting the presence of at least one 
β-lactamase-encoding gene in each E. coli isolate. Substitutions in the 
quinolone resistance-determining regions and the two-component systems involving 
PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB were also found. The metal tolerance gene rcnA (nickel 
and cobalt efflux pump) was the most prevalent. In this regard, 94% of E. coli 
isolates presented the co-occurrence of at least one ARG and metal tolerance 
gene. Furthermore, virulence genes and genetic diversity were found among MDR E. 
coli isolates. The emergence of potentially pathogenic isolates exhibiting 
multidrug resistance and metal tolerance emerged as a global health problem at 
the human-animal-environment interface.

Colistin is the last line of defense for the treatment of multidrug-resistant 
gram-negative bacterial infections. However, colistin resistance is gradually 
increasing worldwide, with resistance commonly regulated by two-component system 
and mcr gene. Thus, this study aimed to investigate molecular epidemiology and 
colistin-resistant mechanism of mcr-positive and mcr-negative Escherichia coli 
isolates from animal in Sichuan Province, China. In this study, a total of 101 
colistin-resistant E. coli strains were isolated from 300 fecal samples in six 
farms in Sichuan Province. PCR was used to detect mcr gene (mcr-1 to mcr-9). The 
prevalence of mcr-1 in colistin-resistant E. coli was 53.47% (54/101), and the 
prevalence of mcr-3 in colistin-resistant E. coli was 10.89% (11/101). The 
colistin-resistant E. coli and mcr-1-positive E. coli showed extensive 
antimicrobial resistance profiles. For follow-up experiments, we used 30 
mcr-negative and 30 mcr-1-positive colistin-resistant E. coli isolates and E. 
coli K-12 MG1655 model strain. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) of 30 strains 
carrying mcr-1 as detected by PCR identified revealed six strains (20%) of ST10 
and three strains (10%) of each ST206, ST48, and ST155 and either two (for ST542 
and 2539) or just one for all other types. The conjugation experiment and 
plasmid replicon type analysis suggest that mcr-1 was more likely to be 
horizontally transferred and primarily localized on IncX4-type and IncI2-type 
plasmid. The ST diversity of the mcr-1 indicated a scattered and non-clonal 
spreading in mcr-1-positive E. coli. Twenty-eight mcr-negative 
colistin-resistant E. coli isolates carried diverse amino acid alterations in 
PmrA, PmrB, PhoP, PhoQ, and MgrB, whereas no mutation was found in the remaining 
isolates. The finding showed the high prevalence of colistin resistance in 
livestock farm environments in Sichuan Province, China. Our study demonstrates 
that colistin resistance is related to chromosomal point mutations including the 
two-component systems PhoP/PhoQ, PmrA/PmrB, and their regulators MgrB. These 
point mutations may confer colistin resistance in mcr-negative E. coli. These 
findings help in gaining insight of chromosomal-encoded colistin resistance in 
E. coli.

Nematicidal potential of the common plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae has been 
recently identified against Caenorhabditis elegans. The current study was 
designed to investigate the detailed genetic mechanism of the bacterial 
pathogenicity by applying comparative genomics, transcriptomics, mutant library 
screening, and protein expression. Results showed that P. syringae strain MB03 
could kill C. elegans in the liquid assay by gut colonization. The genome of P. 
syringae MB03 was sequenced and comparative analysis including multi locus 
sequence typing, and genome-to-genome distance placed MB03 in phylogroup II of 
P. syringae. Furthermore, comparative genomics of MB03 with nematicidal strains 
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1 and PA14) predicted 115 potential virulence 
factors in MB03. However, genes for previously reported nematicidal metabolites, 
such as phenazine, pyochelin, and pyrrolnitrin, were found absent in the MB03 
genome. Transcriptomics analysis showed that the growth phase of the pathogen 
considerably affected the expression of virulence factors, as genes for the 
flagellum, glutamate ABC transporter, phoP/phoQ, fleS/fleR, type VI secretion 
system, and serralysin were highly up-regulated when stationary phase MB03 cells 
interacted with C. elegans. Additionally, screening of a transposon insertion 
mutant library led to the identification of other nematicidal genes such as 
acnA, gltP, oprD, and zapE. Finally, the nematicidal activity of selected 
proteins was confirmed by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli.

Colistin is considered as one of a last resort antimicrobial agent against 
multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the recent emergence of colistin resistance 
(ColR) worldwide that severely restricts therapeutic options is a serious threat 
to global public health. In this study we have investigated the molecular 
determinants in ColR K. pneumoniae isolates collected from clinical specimens. A 
total of 98 E. coli and 195 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates were collected from 
two hospitals from August 2018 to December 2019 in Tehran, Iran. Colistin 
susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined 
according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute by disk diffusion 
method, and microdilution method, respectively. For isolates with colistin MIC 
≥4 μg mL-1, PCR was performed for the detection of mcr-1 to mcr-4 genes. 
Moreover, nucleotide sequences of mgrB, phoP, phoQ, pmrA, and pmrB genes were 
determined by sequencing. Finally, the transcriptional level of pmrK and pmrC 
genes was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). None of 
the E. coli isolates were resistant to colistin while 21 out 195 K. pneumoniae 
isolates were identified as resistant, 19 of which carried mutation in the mgrB 
gene. Three different mutations were observed in the pmrB gene in 3 K. 
pneumoniae isolates. None of the ColR isolates showed alternations in pmrA, 
phoP, and phoQ genes. Furthermore, none of the plasmid-encoding genes were 
detected. Transcriptional level of the pmrK gene increased in all ColR isolates 
meanwhile, pmrC overexpression was detected in 16 out 21 (76.19%) isolates. 
Eventually, all ColR isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. Our results 
demonstrated that the alternation of mgrB gene is the main mechanism related to 
colistin resistance among ColR K. pneumoniae isolates in this study.

Carbapenem and colistin-resistant bacteria represent a global public health 
problem. Refugees carrying these bacteria and living in inadequate shelters can 
spread these microorganisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
intestinal carriage of these bacteria in Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Between 
June and July 2019, 250 rectal swabs were collected from two refugee camps in 
North Lebanon. Swabs were cultured on different selective media. Antibiotic 
susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. 
Carbapenemase-encoding genes and mcr genes were investigated using real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
Epidemiological relatedness was studied using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). 
From 250 rectal swabs, 16 carbapenem-resistant, 5 colistin-resistant, and 4 
colistin and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were isolated. The isolates 
exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. Seven Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates 
harboured the blaOXA-48 gene, and in addition four K. pneumoniae had mutations 
in the two component systems pmrA/pmrB, phoP/phoQ and co-harboured the blaNDM-1 
gene. Moreover, the blaNDM-1 gene was detected in six Escherichia coli and three 
Enterobacter cloacae isolates. The remaining five E. coli isolates harboured the 
mcr-1 gene. MLST results showed several sequence types, with a remarkable clonal 
dissemination. An urgent strategy needs to be adopted in order to avoid the 
spread of such resistance in highly crowded underserved communities.

The increased and inappropriate use of colistin led to the emergence of its 
resistance among Gram-negative bacterial isolates and the most common mechanism 
of colistin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is the modification of the 
lipopolysaccharide mediated by two-component regulatory systems, PhoPQ and 
PmrAB. The aim of the present study was to investigate the transcriptional 
expression of the PhoPQ system against colistin stress in clinical isolates of 
Escherichia coli with colistin-resistant phenotype. Six colistin-resistant E. 
coli isolates were obtained from Silchar Medical College and Hospital, Silchar 
that were of clinical origin and received for routine culture and sensitivity 
testing. Screening for colistin resistance was done by broth microdilution 
method and further screened for the presence of the different types of 
plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mcr genes namely, mcr-1 to mcr-10 by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The screened positive isolates were subjected 
to PCR assay targeting phoP and phoQ genes and their expression was measured by 
quantitative real-time PCR. The results of this study revealed that two E. coli 
isolates (TS2 and TS4) were found to carry the mcr-1 gene. PhoP and PhoQ gene 
amplification was observed in all the isolates. Transcriptional analysis showed 
that the isolates harboring the mcr-1 gene showed an enhanced level of 
expression in the PhoP, PhoQ genes in the presence of a subinhibitory 
concentration of colistin whereas no significant expression was observed for the 
isolates which were devoid of the mcr gene. This study demonstrates the 
involvement of mcr-1 in the PhoPQ system in clinical isolates of 
colistin-resistant E. coli which will help in designing a molecular marker for 
detecting colistin-resistant E. coli and contribute to the assessment of 
resistance burden and infection control strategy.

OBJECTIVE: The spread of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1 
poses a significant public health threat. Little information is available on the 
development of high-level colistin-resistant mutants (HLCRMs) in MCR-1-producing 
Escherichia coli (MCRPEC). The present study was designed to evaluate the impact 
of chromosomal modifications in pmrAB, phoPQ, and mgrB combined with mcr-1 on 
colistin resistance in E. coli.
METHODS: Five MCRPEC and three non-MCRPEC (E. coli ATCC25922 and two 
plasmid-curing) strains were used. The HLCRMs were selected through 
multi-stepwise colistin exposure. Moreover, two E. coli C600-pMCRs were 
constructed and used for selection of HLCRMs. Further analysis included mutation 
rates and DNA sequencing. Transcripts of pmrABC, phoP, mgrB, and mcr-1 were 
quantified by real-time quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: All tested HLCRMs were successfully isolated from their parental 
strains. Non-MCRPEC strains had higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 
and mutation rates than MCRPEC strains. Nineteen amino acid substitutions were 
identified: seven in PmrA, six in PmrB, one in PhoP, three in PhoQ, and two in 
MgrB. Most were detected in non-MCRPEC strains. Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant 
predicted that four substitutions, PmrA Gly15Arg, Gly53Arg, PmrB Pro94Gln, and 
PhoP Asp86Gly, affected protein function. Two HLCRM isolates did not show amino 
acid substitutions in contrast to their parental MCRPEC isolates. No further 
mutations were detected in the second- and third-step mutants. Further 
transcriptional analysis showed that the up-regulation of pmrCAB expression was 
greater in the mutant of E. coli C600 than in E. coli C600-pMCR.
CONCLUSION: Acquisition of the mcr-1 gene had a negative impact on the 
development of HLCRMs in E. coli, but was associated with low-level colistin 
resistance. Thus, colistin-based combination regimens may be effective against 
infections with MCR-1-producing isolates.

After several decades of use, trimethoprim (TMP) remains one of the key access 
antimicrobial drugs listed by the World Health Organization. To circumvent the 
problem of trimethoprim resistance worldwide, a better understanding of 
drug-resistance mechanisms is required. In this study, we screened the 
single-gene knockout library of Escherichia coli, and identified mgrB and other 
several genes involved in trimethoprim resistance. Subsequent comparative 
transcriptional analysis between ΔmgrB and the wild-type strain showed that 
expression levels of phoP, phoQ, and folA were significantly upregulated in 
ΔmgrB. Further deleting phoP or phoQ could partially restore trimethoprim 
sensitivity to ΔmgrB, and co-overexpression of phoP/Q caused TMP resistance, 
suggesting the involvement of PhoP/Q in trimethoprim resistance. 
Correspondingly, MgrB and PhoP were shown to be able to modulated folA 
expression in vivo. After that, efforts were made to test if PhoP could directly 
modulate the expression of folA. Though phosphorylated PhoP could bind to the 
promotor region of folA in vitro, the former only provided a weak protection on 
the latter as shown by the DNA footprinting assay. In addition, deleting the 
deduced PhoP box in ΔmgrB could only slightly reverse the TMP resistance 
phenotype, suggesting that it is less likely for PhoP to directly modulate the 
transcription of folA. Taken together, our data suggested that, in E. coli, MgrB 
affects susceptibility to trimethoprim by modulating the expression of folA with 
the involvement of PhoP/Q. This work broadens our understanding of the 
regulation of folate metabolism and the mechanisms of TMP resistance in 
bacteria.

in Salmonella enterica.

The sigma factor RpoS regulates the expression of many stress response genes and 
is required for virulence in several bacterial species. We now report that RpoS 
accumulates when Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is growing 
logarithmically in media with low Mg(2+) concentrations. This process requires 
the two-component regulatory system PhoP/PhoQ, which is specifically activated 
in low Mg(2+). We show that PhoP controls RpoS protein turnover by serving as a 
transcriptional activator of the iraP (yaiB) gene, which encodes a product that 
enhances RpoS stability by interacting with RssB, the protein that normally 
delivers RpoS to the ClpXP protease for degradation. Mutation of the phoP gene 
rendered Salmonella as sensitive to hydrogen peroxide as an rpoS mutant after 
growth in low Mg(2+). In Escherichia coli, low Mg(2+) leads to only modest RpoS 
stabilization, and iraP is not regulated by PhoP/PhoQ. These findings add the 
sigma factor RpoS to the regulatory proteins and two-component systems that are 
elevated in a PhoP/PhoQ-dependent fashion when Salmonella face low Mg(2+) 
environments. Our data also exemplify the critical differences in regulatory 
circuits that exist between the closely related enteric bacteria Salmonella and 
E. coli.

Bacteria exposed to stress survive by regulating the expression of several genes 
at the transcriptional and translational levels. For instance, in Escherichia 
coli, when growth is arrested in response to stress, such as nutrient 
starvation, the anti-sigma factor Rsd is expressed to inactivate the global 
regulator RpoD and activate the sigma factor RpoS. However, ribosome modulation 
factor (RMF) expressed in response to growth arrest binds to 70S ribosomes to 
form inactive 100S ribosomes and inhibit translational activity. Moreover, 
stress due to fluctuations in the concentration of metal ions essential for 
various intracellular pathways is regulated by a homeostatic mechanism involving 
metal-responsive transcription factors (TFs). Therefore, in this study, we 
examined the binding of a few metal-responsive TFs to the promoter regions of 
rsd and rmf through promoter-specific TF screening and studied the effects of 
these TFs on the expression of rsd and rmf in each TF gene-deficient E. coli 
strain through quantitative PCR, Western blot imaging, and 100S ribosome 
formation analysis. Our results suggest that several metal-responsive TFs (CueR, 
Fur, KdpE, MntR, NhaR, PhoP, ZntR, and ZraR) and metal ions (Cu2+, Fe2+, K+, 
Mn2+, Na+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) influence rsd and rmf gene expression while 
regulating transcriptional and translational activities.

The KdpD/KdpE two-component system: integrating K⁺ homeostasis and virulence.

Kingdom.

The two-component system (TCS) KdpD/KdpE, extensively studied for its regulatory 
role in potassium (K(+)) transport, has more recently been identified as an 
adaptive regulator involved in the virulence and intracellular survival of 
pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, entero-haemorrhagic 
Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia pestis, Francisella species, 
Photorhabdus asymbiotica, and mycobacteria. Key homeostasis requirements 
monitored by KdpD/KdpE and other TCSs such as PhoP/PhoQ are critical to survival 
in the stressful conditions encountered by pathogens during host interactions. 
It follows these TCSs may therefore acquire adaptive roles in response to 
selective pressures associated with adopting a pathogenic lifestyle. Given the 
central role of K(+) in virulence, we propose that KdpD/KdpE, as a regulator of 
a high-affinity K(+) pump, has evolved virulence-related regulatory functions. 
In support of this hypothesis, we review the role of KdpD/KdpE in bacterial 
infection and summarize evidence that (i) KdpD/KdpE production is correlated 
with enhanced virulence and survival, (ii) KdpE regulates a range of virulence 
loci through direct promoter binding, and (iii) KdpD/KdpE regulation responds to 
virulence-related conditions including phagocytosis, exposure to microbicides, 
quorum sensing signals, and host hormones. Furthermore, antimicrobial stress, 
osmotic stress, and oxidative stress are associated with KdpD/KdpE activity, and 
the system's accessory components (which allow TCS fine-tuning or crosstalk) 
provide links to stress response pathways. KdpD/KdpE therefore appears to be an 
important adaptive TCS employed during host infection, promoting bacterial 
virulence and survival through mechanisms both related to and distinct from its 
conserved role in K(+) regulation.

Mutation of the PhoP/Q two-component system decreases the expression of ybjX and 
pagP encoding outer membrane proteins, and mutation of ybjX or pagP attenuates 
avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) pathogenicity. However, whether 
ybjX/pagP mutation (double-deletion mutant) has a synergistic effect on 
pathogenicity remains unknown. Herein, electrophoresis mobility shift assay 
(EMSA) experiments showed that the PhoP/Q system regulated ybjX and pagP 
transcription indirectly. The APECΔybjX/pagP mutant strain, constructed using 
the Red recombination method, exhibited reduced invasion of chicken embryo 
fibroblast (DF-1) cells, but had no effect on virulence in a chicken model. 
Using RNA sequencing to identify differential mRNAs in APECΔybjXΔpagP and native 
strains, we revealed up-regulation of genes involved in the bacterial chemotaxis 
pathway. The ybjX/pagP mutant strain displayed significantly increased motility, 
suggesting that double deletion of ybjX and pagP enhances motility via the 
bacterial chemotaxis pathway.

Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) are important pathogens that cause 
serious economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. The PhoP/Q system is 
essential for APEC pathogenicity, and its mutation leads to a decrease in ybjX 
gene expression, but whether ybjX regulated by PhoP/Q plays a role in 
pathogenicity remains unclear. The role of ybjX in APEC pathogenicity was 
investigated using a ybjX mutant strain constructed from APEC strain AE17 by the 
Red recombination method. The mutant strain displayed significantly reduced 
adherence to and invasion of chicken embryo fibroblast cell line (DF-1) cells. 
Moreover, N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) assays revealed an increase in outer 
membrane permeabilization for the ybjX mutant, suggesting ybjX affected 
susceptibility to avian beta-defensin through this mechanism. The ybjX mutation 
increased susceptibility to avian beta-defensin 9 (AvBD9), and in vivo LD50 
assays revealed reduced bacterial virulence in a chicken model. Taken together, 
these results indicated that mutation of ybjX may attenuate APEC pathogenicity, 
not only by affecting bacterial adhesion and invasion, but also via reducing 
resistance to avian beta-defensin by increasing outer membrane permeabilization 
of bacteria.

We studied a collection of 79 colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates 
isolated from diseased pigs in France between 2009 and 2013. We determined a 
number of phenotypic and genetic characters using broth microdilution to 
characterize their antimicrobial susceptibility. We performed pulse field gel 
electrophoresis (PFGE) to assess their genetic diversity and assign them to 
phylogroups. High-throughput real-time PCR micro-array was used to screen for a 
selection of genetic markers of virulence, and PCR and sequencing of the main 
recognized resistance genes allowed us to investigate the mechanisms of colistin 
resistance. Results showed that isolates belonged to several phylogroups and 
most had a unique PFGE profile. More than 50% of the isolates were also 
resistant to sulfonamides, trimethoprim, tetracycline, ampicillin or 
chloramphenicol. The mcr-1 gene was detected in 70 out of 79 isolates and was 
transferred by conjugation in 33 of them, sometimes together with resistance to 
sulfonamides, trimethoprim, tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, 
cefotaxime, or gentamicin. Mutations in the amino-acid sequences of proteins 
MgrB, PhoP, PhoQ, PmrB, but not PmrA, were detected in isolates with or without 
the mcr-1 gene. More than one-third of the isolates harbored the F18, F4, astA, 
hlyA, estI, estII, elt, stx2e, iha, orfA, orfB, paa, terE, ecs1763, or ureD 
virulence markers. In conclusion, although most isolates had a unique PFGE 
profile, a few particular combinations of phylogenetic groups, virulence genes 
and mutations in the sequenced genes involved in colistin resistance were 
identified on a number of occasions, suggesting the persistence of certain 
isolates over several years.

Virulence and drug resistance roles of multidrug efflux systems of Salmonella 
enterica serovar Typhimurium.

Drug efflux systems play a major role in resistance to a wide range of noxious 
compounds in several Gram negative species. Here, we report the drug resistance 
and virulence phenotypes of Salmonella mutants defective in either 
resistance-nodulation-division (RND)-type systems and/or in drug efflux systems 
belonging to the major facilitator (MFS), multidrug and toxic compound extrusion 
(MATE), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamilies. We determined that nine 
potential drug transporters contribute to drug resistance of Salmonella and 
found that the Salmonella-specific MdsABC system conferred resistance to a 
variety of toxic compounds. The RND-type MdsAB system could function with either 
MdsC, which is encoded in the same operon, or TolC as the outer membrane 
component. Although the Salmonella EmrAB, MdfA and MdtK are 90% identical in 
their amino acid sequences to their Escherichia coli homologues, the drug 
specificity of Salmonella transporters was different from that reported for 
equivalent E. coli transporters. Deletion of the macAB genes attenuated 
Salmonella virulence and a strain lacking all drug efflux systems was avirulent 
when mice were inoculated by the oral route. The promoter region of the macAB 
drug efflux system genes harbours a binding site for the response regulator 
PhoP, which functions to repress macAB transcription. The PhoP/PhoQ 
two-component system is a major regulator of Salmonella virulence, which 
underscores the connection between drug efflux systems and virulence.

Roles of hilC and hilD in regulation of hilA expression in Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium.

Lucas RL(1), Lee CA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Harvard Medical School, 
Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Sequences between -332 and -39 upstream of the hilA promoter are required for 
repression of hilA. An unidentified repressor is thought to bind these upstream 
repressing sequences (URS) to inhibit hilA expression. Two AraC-like 
transcriptional regulators encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1), 
HilC and HilD, bind to the URS to counteract the repression of hilA. The URS is 
required for regulation of hilA by osmolarity, oxygen, PhoP/PhoQ, and SirA/BarA. 
Here, we show that FadD, FliZ, PhoB, and EnvZ/OmpR also require the URS to 
regulate hilA. These environmental and regulatory factors may affect hilA 
expression by altering the expression or activity of HilC, HilD, or the unknown 
repressor. To begin investigating these possibilities, we tested the effects of 
environmental and regulatory factors on hilC and hilD expression. We also 
examined hilA regulation when hilC or hilD was disrupted or expressed to a high 
level. Although hilC is regulated by all environmental conditions and regulatory 
factors that modulate hilA expression, hilC is not required for the regulation 
of hilA by any conditions or factors except EnvZ/OmpR. In contrast, hilD is 
absolutely required for hilA expression, but environmental conditions and 
regulatory factors have little or no effect on hilD expression. We speculate 
that EnvZ/OmpR regulates hilA by altering the expression and/or activity of 
hilC, while all other regulatory conditions and mutations regulate hilA by 
modulating hilD posttranscriptionally. We also discuss models in which the 
regulation of hilA expression is mediated by modulation of the expression or 
activity of one or more repressors.

Signal-dependent requirement for the co-activator protein RcsA in transcription 
of the RcsB-regulated ugd gene.

Mouslim C(1), Latifi T, Groisman EA.

(1)Department of Molecular Microbiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute,

The RcsC/YojN/RcsB phosphorelay system controls gene expression in response to a 
variety of signals, including changes in temperature, osmolarity, and 
overproduction of membrane proteins. Transcription of certain RcsB-activated 
genes, such as the capsule synthesis cps operon, requires the co-activator 
protein RcsA, whereas expression of other RcsB-activated genes is 
RcsA-independent. We have established previously that a tolB mutation induces 
transcription of the Salmonella UDP-glucose dehydrogenase ugd gene in an RcsA- 
and RcsB-dependent manner. This induction is independent of the two-component 
systems PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB, which are required for ugd expression in 
response to low Mg2+. We now report that the RcsC/YojN/RcsB system is activated 
in a pmrA mutant experiencing Fe3+ and low Mg2+, resulting in expression of both 
cps and ugd genes. However, whereas cps transcription remained RcsA-dependent, 
ugd transcription became RcsA-independent but dependent on the PhoP protein. S1 
mapping experiments demonstrated that RcsA-dependent and -independent 
transcription of the ugd gene use the same promoter. DNase footprinting analysis 
identified a PhoP-binding site in the ugd promoter. Yet, PhoP-mediated ugd 
transcription required either the RcsC/YojN/RcsB or the PmrA/PmrB systems.

The Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) consists of closely related bacteria 
commonly associated with the human microbiota. ECC are increasingly isolated 
from healthcare-associated infections, demonstrating that these 
Enterobacteriaceae are emerging nosocomial pathogens. ECC can rapidly acquire 
multidrug resistance to conventional antibiotics. Cationic antimicrobial 
peptides (CAMPs) have served as therapeutic alternatives because they target the 
highly conserved lipid A component of the Gram-negative outer membrane. Many 
Enterobacteriaceae fortify their outer membrane with cationic amine-containing 
moieties to prevent CAMP binding, which can lead to cell lysis. The PmrAB 
two-component system (TCS) directly activates 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose 
(l-Ara4N) biosynthesis to result in cationic amine moiety addition to lipid A in 
many Enterobacteriaceae such as E. coli and Salmonella. In contrast, PmrAB is 
dispensable for CAMP resistance in E. cloacae. Interestingly, some ECC clusters 
exhibit colistin heteroresistance, where a subpopulation of cells exhibit 
clinically significant resistance levels compared to the majority population. We 
demonstrate that E. cloacae lipid A is modified with l-Ara4N to induce CAMP 
heteroresistance and the regulatory mechanism is independent of the PmrABEcl 
TCS. Instead, PhoPEcl binds to the arnBEcl promoter to induce l-Ara4N 
biosynthesis and PmrAB-independent addition to the lipid A disaccharolipid. 
Therefore, PhoPQEcl contributes to regulation of CAMP heteroresistance in some 
ECC clusters.

Polymyxins are a class of cyclic peptides with antimicrobial activity against 
Gram-negative bacteria. In Enterobacteriaceae, the PhoQ/PhoP and PmrB/PmrA 
two-component systems regulate many genes that confer resistance to both 
polymyxins and host antimicrobial peptides. The activities of these 
two-component systems are modulated by additional proteins that are conserved 
across Enterobacteriaceae, such as MgrB, a negative regulator of PhoQ, and PmrD, 
a "connector" protein that activates PmrB/PmrA in response to PhoQ/PhoP 
stimulation. Despite the conservation of many protein components of the 
PhoQ/PhoP-PmrD-PmrB/PmrA network, the specific molecular interactions and 
regulatory mechanisms vary across different genera. Here, we explore the role of 
PmrD in modulating this signaling network in Klebsiella pneumoniae and 
Escherichia coli We show that in K. pneumoniae, PmrD is not required for 
polymyxin resistance arising from mutation of mgrB-the most common cause of 
spontaneous polymyxin resistance in this bacterium-suggesting that direct 
activation of polymyxin resistance genes by PhoQ/PhoP plays a critical role in 
this resistance pathway. However, for conditions of low pH or intermediate iron 
concentrations, both of which stimulate PmrB/PmrA, we find that PmrD does 
contribute to resistance. We further show that in E. coli, PmrD functions as a 
connector between PhoQ/PhoP and PmrB/PmrA, in contrast with previous reports. In 
this case, activity also depends on PmrB/PmrA stimulation, or on very high 
activation of PhoQ/PhoP. Our results indicate that the importance of the PmrD 
connector in modulating the polymyxin resistance network depends on both the 
network organization and on the environmental conditions associated with PmrB 
stimulation.

Molecular basis of bile-salt- and iron-induced enterohaemorrhagic E. coli 
resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides.

Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia 
coli (EHEC) is critically dependent on its ability to sense and respond to 
various microenvironments within the host. EHEC exposure to physiologically 
relevant levels of bile salts upregulates the two-component system, pmrAB, and 
the arnBCADTEF operon, resulting in lipopolysaccharide modification and 
increased resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptide, polymyxin B (PMB). A 
similar pmrAB- and arn-dependent PMB resistance has been observed in Salmonella 
enterica in the presence of ferric iron. Limiting magnesium levels and mild acid 
can also induce Salmonella resistance to PMB through another two-component 
system, PhoPQ and the connector protein, PmrD. This study aims to evaluate the 
relative contributions of a bile-salt mix (BSM), iron, limiting magnesium as 
well as the roles of pmrAB, phoPQ and pmrD to EHEC's resistance to PMB. Killing 
assays show that EHEC treatment with the BSM or iron under excess magnesium and 
neutral pH conditions induces a pmrAB-dependent, phoP-independent PMB 
resistance. By contrast, exposure to limiting magnesium triggers a pmrB-, phoP- 
and pmrD-dependent PMB resistance. The iron-induced PMB resistance is 
independent of phoP and pmrD under limiting magnesium conditions while the 
bile-salt-induced PMB resistance is independent of pmrD only under 
non-PhoP-inducing conditions. GFP-pmrD transcriptional reporter studies reveal 
that the limiting magnesium enhances pmrD expression, which is repressed upon 
additional exposure to either BSM or iron. Our results also show that exposure 
to mild acid enhances PMB resistance in a pmrD-independent manner and GFP 
reporter results confirm minimal expression of pmrD at this pH regardless of the 
magnesium level. This study provides novel insights into how EHEC differentially 
employs PmrAB, PhoPQ and PmrD to monitor and respond to bile salts, iron, acidic 
pH and magnesium typically encountered within the gastrointestinal tract in 
order to modulate its survival against cationic antimicrobial peptides.

PURPOSE: Colistin resistance in gram-negative bacteria from humans and livestock 
has been increasingly reported worldwide. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the underlying mechanisms of chromosome-mediated colistin resistance 
in Escherichia coli isolates from livestock in Korea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty mcr-1-negative isolates were selected from a 
collection of colistin-resistant E. coli isolates collected from livestock in 
2005 and 2015 in Korea. Amino acid alterations in PmrAB, PhoPQ, MgrB, and PmrD 
were investigated. Colistin-resistant derivatives were produced by serial 
passage of colistin-susceptible E. coli isolates in colistin-containing media.
RESULTS: Thirty colistin-resistant mcr-negative E. coli isolates were classified 
into 26 sequence types. Twenty-two isolates carried diverse amino acid 
alterations in PmrB, PhoP, PhoQ, MgrB, and/or PmrD, whereas no mutation in any 
of these genes was found in the remaining eight isolates. Sixteen out of the 22 
isolates shared a total of nine polymorphic positions that were found in 
colistin-susceptible E. coli strains. Colistin-resistant derivatives from two 
colistin-susceptible isolates showed the same genetic alterations that were 
observed in colistin-resistant clinical isolates.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the mechanism underlying 
chromosome-mediated colistin resistance remain to be discovered in E. coli. 
Selective pressure of colistin in vitro induced the same genetic mutations 
associated with colistin resistance in vivo. Efforts to reduce colistin 
consumption in livestock should be redoubled, to prevent the occurrence of 
colistin-resistant E. coli strains.

In Salmonella enterica, PmrD is a connector protein that links the two-component 
systems PhoP-PhoQ and PmrA-PmrB. While Escherichia coli encodes a PmrD homolog, 
it is thought to be incapable of connecting PhoPQ and PmrAB in this organism due 
to functional divergence from the S. enterica protein. However, our laboratory 
previously observed that low concentrations of Mg(2+), a PhoPQ-activating 
signal, leads to the induction of PmrAB-dependent lipid A modifications in 
wild-type E. coli (C. M. Herrera, J. V. Hankins, and M. S. Trent, Mol Microbiol 
76:1444-1460, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07150.x). These 
modifications include phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) and 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose 
(l-Ara4N), which promote bacterial resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides 
(CAMPs) when affixed to lipid A. Here, we demonstrate that pmrD is required for 
modification of the lipid A domain of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) under 
low-Mg(2+) growth conditions. Further, RNA sequencing shows that E. coli pmrD 
influences the expression of pmrA and its downstream targets, including genes 
coding for the modification enzymes that transfer pEtN and l-Ara4N to the lipid 
A molecule. In line with these findings, a pmrD mutant is dramatically impaired 
in survival compared with the wild-type strain when exposed to the CAMP 
polymyxin B. Notably, we also reveal the presence of an unknown factor or system 
capable of activating pmrD to promote lipid A modification in the absence of the 
PhoPQ system. These results illuminate a more complex network of protein 
interactions surrounding activation of PhoPQ and PmrAB in E. coli than 
previously understood.

BACKGROUND: Polymyxin B resistance protein D (PmrD) plays a key role in the 
polymyxin B-resistance pathway, as it is the signaling protein that can act as a 
specific connecter between PmrA/PmrB and PhoP/PhoQ. We conducted structural 
analysis to characterize Escherichia coli (E. coli) PmrD, which exhibits 
different features compared with PmrD in other bacteria.
RESULTS: The X-ray crystal structure of E. coli PmrD was determined at a 2.00 Å 
resolution, revealing novel information such as the unambiguous secondary 
structures of the protein and the presence of a disulfide bond. Furthermore, 
various assays such as native gel electrophoresis, surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR), size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and 
small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, were performed to elucidate 
the structural and functional role of the internal disulfide bond in E. coli 
PmrD.
CONCLUSIONS: The structural characteristics of E. coli PmrD were clearly 
identified via diverse techniques. The findings help explain the different 
protective mechanism of E. coli compared to other Gram-negative bacteria.

Ancestral genes can control the ability of horizontally acquired loci to confer 
new traits.

Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States of America.

Horizontally acquired genes typically function as autonomous units conferring 
new abilities when introduced into different species. However, we reasoned that 
proteins preexisting in an organism might constrain the functionality of a 
horizontally acquired gene product if it operates on an ancestral pathway. Here, 
we determine how the horizontally acquired pmrD gene product activates the 
ancestral PmrA/PmrB two-component system in Salmonella enterica but not in the 
closely related bacterium Escherichia coli. The Salmonella PmrD protein binds to 
the phosphorylated PmrA protein (PmrA-P), protecting it from dephosphorylation 
by the PmrB protein. This results in transcription of PmrA-dependent genes, 
including those conferring polymyxin B resistance. We now report that the E. 
coli PmrD protein can activate the PmrA/PmrB system in Salmonella even though it 
cannot do it in E. coli, suggesting that these two species differ in an 
additional component controlling PmrA-P levels. We establish that the E. coli 
PmrB displays higher phosphatase activity towards PmrA-P than the Salmonella 
PmrB, and we identified a PmrB subdomain responsible for this property. 
Replacement of the E. coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog was sufficient 
to render E. coli resistant to polymyxin B under PmrD-inducing conditions. Our 
findings provide a singular example whereby quantitative differences in the 
biochemical activities of orthologous ancestral proteins dictate the ability of 
a horizontally acquired gene product to confer species-specific traits. And they 
suggest that horizontally acquired genes can potentiate selection at ancestral 
loci.

Resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B from Gram-negative 
bacteria is accomplished by two-component systems (TCSs), protein complexes 
PmrA/PmrB and PhoP/PhoQ. PmrD is the first protein identified to mediate the 
connectivity between two TCSs. The 3D structure of PmrD has been recently solved 
by NMR and its unique fold was revealed. Here, a molecular dynamics study is 
presented started from the NMR structure. Numerous hydrophobic and electrostatic 
interactions were identified to contribute to PmrD's 3D stability. Moreover, the 
mobility of the five loops that connect the protein's six beta-strands has been 
explored. Solvent-accessible surface area calculation revealed that a 
Leucine-rich hydrophobic cluster of the protein stabilized the protein's 
structure.

PmrA/PmrB and PhoP/PhoQ are a pair of two-component systems (TCSs) that allow 
the Gram-negative bacteria to survive the cationic antimicrobial peptide 
polymyxin B. The two TCSs are linked by the polymyxin resistance protein, PmrD. 
The PhoP-activated PmrD protects the phosphorylated response regulator PmrA from 
dephosphorylation, and promotes the transcription of PmrA-activated genes 
responsible for polymyxin resistance. PmrD is the first protein identified to 
mediate the connectivity between two TCSs by protecting the phosphorylated 
response regulator of the downstream TCS. PmrD shows no homology to proteins 
with known structures. We present here the solution structure of PmrD from 
Escherichia coli, the first three-dimensional structure of the PmrD family. Our 
study provides the structural basis of the novel interacting mechanism of 
bacterial two-component signal-transduction systems.

systems.

Bacteria have many two-component signal-transduction systems (TCSs) that respond 
to specific environmental signals by altering the phosphorylated state of a 
response regulator. Although these systems are presumed to form an intricate 
signal network, the detailed mechanism of how they interact with each other 
remains largely unexplained. In a recent study of Salmonella, two TCSs have been 
discovered to be connected by a protein that protects a response regulator from 
dephosphorylation promoted by its cognate sensor kinase. This novel mechanism 
might provide an answer to some of the linkages found between other TCSs.

Synthesis of the 31-amino acid, inner membrane protein MgtS (formerly denoted 
YneM) is induced by very low Mg2+ in a PhoPQ-dependent manner in Escherichia 
coli Here we report that MgtS acts to increase intracellular Mg2+ levels and 
maintain cell integrity upon Mg2+ depletion. Upon development of a functional 
tagged derivative of MgtS, we found that MgtS interacts with MgtA to increase 
the levels of this P-type ATPase Mg2+ transporter under Mg2+-limiting 
conditions. Correspondingly, the effects of MgtS upon Mg2+ limitation are lost 
in a ∆mgtA mutant, and MgtA overexpression can suppress the ∆mgtS phenotype. 
MgtS stabilization of MgtA provides an additional layer of regulation of this 
tightly controlled Mg2+ transporter and adds to the list of small proteins that 
regulate inner membrane transporters.

Membrane organization is usually associated with the correct function of a 
number of cellular processes in eukaryotic cells as diverse as signal 
transduction, protein sorting, membrane trafficking, or pathogen invasion. It 
has been recently discovered that bacterial membranes are able to 
compartmentalize their signal transduction pathways in functional membrane 
microdomains (FMMs). In this review article, we discuss the biological 
significance of the existence of FMMs in bacteria and comment on possible 
beneficial roles that FMMs play on the harbored signal transduction cascades. 
Moreover, four different membrane-associated signal transduction cascades whose 
functions are linked to the integrity of FMMs are introduced, and the specific 
role that FMMs play in stabilizing and promoting interactions of their signaling 
components is discussed. Altogether, FMMs seem to play a relevant role in 
promoting more efficient activation of signal transduction cascades in bacterial 
cells and show that bacteria are more sophisticated organisms than previously 
appreciated.

BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi is a human-restricted 
intracellular pathogen and the cause of typhoid fever. Cellular immune responses 
are required to control and clear Salmonella infection. Despite this, there are 
limited data on cellular immune responses in humans infected with wild type S. 
Typhi.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For this work, we used an automated approach to 
purify a subset of S. Typhi proteins identified in previous antibody-based 
immuno-affinity screens and antigens known to be expressed in vivo, including 
StaF-putative fimbrial protein-STY0202, StbB-fimbrial chaperone-STY0372, 
CsgF-involved in curli production-STY1177, CsgD- putative regulatory 
protein-STY1179, OppA-periplasmic oligopeptide binding protein 
precursor-STY1304, PagC-outer membrane invasion protein-STY1878, and conserved 
hypothetical protein-STY2195; we also generated and analyzed a crude membrane 
preparation of S. Typhi (MP). In comparison to samples collected from uninfected 
Bangladeshi and North American participants, we detected significant 
interferon-γ responses in PBMCs stimulated with MP, StaF, StbB, CsgF, CsgD, 
OppA, STY2195, and PagC in patients bacteremic with S. Typhi in Bangladesh. The 
majority of interferon-γ expressing T cells were CD4 cells, although CD8 
responses also occurred. We also assessed cellular proliferation responses in 
bacteremic patients, and confirmed increased responses in infected individuals 
to MP, StaF, STY2195, and PagC in convalescent compared to acute phase samples 
and compared to controls. StaF is a fimbrial protein homologous to E. coli YadK, 
and contains a Pfam motif thought to be involved in cellular adhesion. PagC is 
expressed in vivo under the control of the virulence-associated PhoP-regulon 
required for intra-macrophage survival of Salmonella. STY2195 is a conserved 
hypothetical protein of unknown function.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first analysis of cellular immune responses 
to purified S. Typhi antigens in patients with typhoid fever. These results 
indicate that patients generate significant CD4 and CD8 interferon-γ responses 
to specific S. Typhi antigens during typhoid fever, and that these responses are 
elevated at the time of clinical presentation. These observations suggest that 
an interferon-γ based detection system could be used to diagnose individuals 
with typhoid fever during the acute stage of illness.

Transcriptional analysis of a constitutively active mutant of the EvgA/EvgS 
two-component system of Escherichia coli resulted in enhanced expression of 13 
PhoP/PhoQ-regulated genes, crcA, hemL, mgtA, ompT, phoP, phoQ, proP, rstA, rstB, 
slyB, ybjG, yrbL, and mgrB. This regulatory network between the two systems also 
occurred as a result of overproduction of the EvgA regulator; however, enhanced 
transcription of the phoPQ genes did not further activate expression of the 
PhoP/PhoQ-regulated genes. These results demonstrated signal transduction from 
the EvgA/EvgS system to the PhoP/PhoQ system in E. coli and also identified the 
genes that required the two systems for enhanced expression. This is one example 
of the intricate signal transduction networks that are posited to exist in E. 
coli.

ω-Hydroxy palmitic acid (ω-HPA) is a valuable compound for an ingredient of 
artificially synthesized ceramides and an additive for lubricants and adhesives. 
Production of such a fatty acid derivative is limited by chemical catalysis, but 
plausible by biocatalysis. However, its low productivity issue, including 
formations of unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) byproducts in host cells, remains as 
a hurdle toward industrial biological processes. In this study, to achieve 
selective and high-level production of ω-HPA from glucose in Escherichia coli, 
FadR, a native transcriptional regulator of fatty acid metabolism, and its 
regulon were engineered. First, FadR was co-expressed with a thioesterase with a 
specificity toward palmitic acid production to enhance palmitic acid production 
yield, but a considerable quantity of UFAs was also produced. In order to avoid 
the UFA production caused by fadR overexpression, FadR regulon was rewired by i) 
mutating FadR consensus binding sites of fabA or fabB, ii) integrating fabZ into 
fabI operon, and iii) enhancing the strength of fabI promoter. This approach led 
to dramatic increases in both proportion (48.3-83.0%) and titer (377.8 mg/L to 
675.8 mg/L) of palmitic acid, mainly due to the decrease in UFA synthesis. 
Introducing a fatty acid ω-hydroxylase, CYP153A35, into the engineered strain 
resulted in a highly selective production of ω-HPA (83.5 mg/L) accounting for 
87.5% of total ω-hydroxy fatty acids. Furthermore, strategies, such as i) 
enhancement in CYP153A35 activity, ii) expression of a fatty acid transporter, 
iii) supplementation of triton X-100, and iv) separation of the ω-HPA synthetic 
pathway into two strains for a co-culture system, were applied and resulted in 
401.0 mg/L of ω-HPA production. For such selective productions of palmitic acid 
and ω-HPA, the rewiring of FadR regulation in E. coli is a promising strategy to 
develop an industrial process with economical downstream processing.

Escherichia coli strain SM101 harbors a temperature-sensitive allele (lpxA2) of 
the gene encoding UDP-Glc-NAc acyltransferase (the first enzyme of the lipid A 
pathway). SM101 is temperature-sensitive for lipid A biosynthesis and growth. To 
determine whether or not E. coli mutants lacking lipid A can be isolated, we 
examined temperature-resistant revertants of SM101. All regained the ability to 
synthesize lipid A. However, some were not true revertants but had acquired 
mutations in a neighboring gene (orf17), while retaining the original lpxA2 
lesion. Cell extracts of such revertants displayed 2-5 fold reductions in the 
specific activity of (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP dehydrase. Wild-type cells that 
overproduced the protein encoded by orf17 overproduced (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP 
dehydrase activity as much as 170-fold, suggesting that orf17 is the structural 
gene for the dehydrase. The proposed function of orf17 is further supported by 
its sequence similarity to fabA, the structural gene for (3R)-hydroxydecanoyl 
dehydrase of E. coli. We suggest that bypass of the lpxA2 phenotype by mutations 
in orf17 may be due to an increased (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP pool. The orf17 
gene (which we now designate fabZ) is not regulated by fadR. However, orf17 may 
be related to sefA, a suppressor of certain lesions in the cell division/lipid A 
biosynthesis gene, envA.

Fatty acids are important precursors to biofuels. The Escherichia coli FadR is a 
transcription factor that regulates several processes in fatty acid 
biosynthesis, degradation, and membrane transport. By tuning the expression of 
FadR in an engineered E. coli host, we were able to increase fatty acid titer by 
7.5-fold over our previously engineered fatty acid-producing strain, reaching 
5.2±0.5g/L and 73% of the theoretical yield. The mechanism by which FadR 
enhanced fatty acid yield was studied by whole-genome transcriptional analysis 
(microarray) and targeted proteomics. Overexpression of FadR led to 
transcriptional changes for many genes, including genes involved in fatty acid 
pathways. The biggest transcriptional changes in fatty acid pathway genes 
included fabB, fabF, and accA. Overexpression of any of these genes alone did 
not result in a high yield comparable to fadR expression, indicating that FadR 
enhanced fatty acid production globally by tuning the expression levels of many 
genes to optimal levels.

Synthesis of the NarP response regulator of nitrate respiration in Escherichia 
coli is regulated at multiple levels by Hfq and small RNAs.

Two-component systems (TCS) and small RNAs (sRNA) are widespread regulators that 
participate in the response and the adaptation of bacteria to their 
environments. TCSs and sRNAs mostly act at the transcriptional and 
post-transcriptional levels, respectively, and can be found integrated in 
regulatory circuits, where TCSs control sRNAs transcription and/or sRNAs 
post-transcriptionally regulate TCSs synthesis. In response to nitrate and 
nitrite, the paralogous NarQ-NarP and NarX-NarL TCSs regulate the expression of 
genes involved in anaerobic respiration of these alternative electron acceptors 
to oxygen. In addition to the previously reported repression of NarP synthesis 
by the SdsN137 sRNA, we show here that RprA, another Hfq-dependent sRNA, also 
negatively controls narP. Interestingly, the repression of narP by RprA actually 
relies on two independent mechanisms of control. The first is via the direct 
pairing of the central region of RprA to the narP translation initiation region 
and presumably occurs at the translation initiation level. In contrast, the 
second requires only the very 5' end of the narP mRNA, which is targeted, most 
likely indirectly, by the full-length or the shorter, processed, form of RprA. 
In addition, our results raise the possibility of a direct role of Hfq in narP 
control, further illustrating the diversity of post-transcriptional regulation 
mechanisms in the synthesis of TCSs.

Gutenberg-University Mainz, Mainz, 55099, Germany.

Many bacteria are able to use O2 and nitrate as alternative electron acceptors 
for respiration. Strategies for regulation in response to O2 and nitrate can 
vary considerably. In the paradigmatic system of E. coli (and γ-proteobacteria), 
regulation by O2 and nitrate is established by the O2 -sensor FNR and the 
two-component system NarX-NarL (for nitrate regulation). Expression of narGHJI 
is regulated by the binding of FNR and NarL to the promoter. A similar strategy 
by individual regulation in response to O2 and nitrate is verified in many 
genera by the use of various types of regulators. Otherwise, in the soil 
bacteria Bacillus subtilis (Firmicutes) and Streptomyces (Actinobacteria), 
nitrate respiration is subject to anaerobic induction, without direct nitrate 
induction. In contrast, the NreA-NreB-NreC two-component system of 
Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) performs joint sensing of O2 and nitrate by 
interacting O2 and nitrate sensors. The O2 -sensor NreB phosphorylates the 
response regulator NreC to activate narGHJI expression. NreC-P transmits the 
signal for anaerobiosis to the promoter. The nitrate sensor NreA modulates NreB 
function by converting NreB in the absence of nitrate from the kinase to a 
phosphatase that dephosphorylates NreC-P. Thus, widely different strategies for 
coordinating the response to O2 and nitrate have evolved in bacteria.

Microbes reprogrammed using advanced genetic circuits are envisaged as emerging 
living diagnostics for a wide range of diseases and play key roles in regulating 
gut microbiota to treat disease-associated symptoms in a non-invasive manner. 
Here, we developed a designer probiotic Escherichia coli that senses and 
responds to nitrate, a biomarker of gut inflammation. To this end, we first 
employed the NarX-NarL two-component regulatory system in E. coli to construct a 
nitrate-responsive genetic circuit. Next, we optimized the nitrate biosensor for 
the best performance using measures of sensitivity and specificity. We then 
introduced this genetic circuit into a probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. We 
demonstrated that the designed biosensor can sense elevated nitrate levels 
during gut inflammation in mice with native gut microbiota. Moreover, using 
Boolean AND gate, we generated a genetically encoded biosensor for simultaneous 
sensing of the thiosulfate and nitrate biomarkers, thus increasing the tool's 
specificity for diagnosing gut inflammation. The nitrate-responsive genetic 
circuit will enable new approaches for non-invasive diagnostics of 
inflammation-associated diseases.

The Escherichia coli NarX/NarL two-component response-regulator system regulates 
gene expression in response to nitrate ions and the NarL protein is a global 
transcription factor, which activates transcript initiation at many target 
promoters. One such target, the E. coli ogt promoter, which controls the 
expression of an O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase, is dependent on NarL 
binding to two DNA targets centred at positions -44.5 and -77.5 upstream from 
the transcript start. Here, we describe ogt promoter derivatives that can be 
activated solely by NarL binding either at position -44.5 or position -77.5. We 
show that NarL can also activate the ogt promoter when located at position 
-67.5. We present data to argue that NarL-dependent activation of transcript 
initiation at the ogt promoter results from a direct interaction between NarL 
and a determinant in the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit. 
Footprinting experiments show that, at the -44.5 promoter, NarL and the 
C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit bind to opposite faces of 
promoter DNA, suggesting an unusual mechanism of transcription activation. Our 
work suggests new organisations for activator-dependent transcription at 
promoters and future applications for biotechnology.

Augmenting live cells with new signal transduction capabilities is a key 
objective in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. We showed earlier that 
two-component signaling pathways could function in mammalian cells, albeit while 
losing their ligand sensitivity. Here, we show how to transduce small-molecule 
ligands in a dose-dependent fashion into gene expression in mammalian cells 
using two-component signaling machinery. First, we engineer mutually 
complementing truncated mutants of a histidine kinase unable to dimerize and 
phosphorylate the response regulator. Next, we fuse these mutants to protein 
domains capable of ligand-induced dimerization, which restores the phosphoryl 
transfer in a ligand-dependent manner. Cytoplasmic ligands are transduced by 
facilitating mutant dimerization in the cytoplasm, while extracellular ligands 
trigger dimerization at the inner side of a plasma membrane. These findings 
point to the potential of two-component regulatory systems as enabling tools for 
orthogonal signaling pathways in mammalian cells.

Bacteria live in environments with dynamic changes. To sense and respond to 
different external stimuli, bacteria make use of various sensor-response 
circuits, called two-component systems (TCSs). A TCS comprises a histidine 
protein kinase (HK) sensing environmental stimuli and a response regulator 
protein (RR) regulating downstream genes. The two components are coupled via a 
phosphorylation control mechanism. In a recent study, we adopted an optogenetics 
approach to re-engineer the sensor HKs in Escherichia coli as a light-sensing 
fusion protein. We constructed a light-controllable HK by replacing the original 
signal-specific sensing domain of HK with the light-sensing domain of Cph1 from 
Cyanobacteria Synechocystis, so that HK can be investigated by red light. Here, 
we extended the study to other 16 HK-RR TCSs and constructed a library of 
light-responsible HK-Cph1 chimeras. By taking the NarX-NarL system as an 
example, we demonstrated the light responsiveness of the constructed chimera and 
investigated the frequency response of the NarXNarL system. The constructed 
library serves as a toolkit for future TCS study using optogenetics approach.

In two-component signal transduction, a sensor protein transmitter module 
controls cognate receiver domain phosphorylation. Most receiver domain sequences 
contain a small residue (Gly or Ala) at position T + 1 just distal to the 
essential Thr or Ser residue that forms part of the active site. However, some 
members of the NarL receiver subfamily have a large hydrophobic residue at 
position T + 1. Our laboratory previously isolated a NarL mutant in which the T 
+ 1 residue Val-88 was replaced with an orthodox small Ala. This NarL V88A 
mutant confers a striking phenotype in which high-level target operon expression 
is both signal (nitrate) and sensor (NarX and NarQ) independent. This suggests 
that the NarL V88A protein is phosphorylated by cross talk from noncognate 
sources. Although cross talk was enhanced in ackA null strains that accumulate 
acetyl phosphate, it persisted in pta ackA double null strains that cannot 
synthesize this compound and was observed also in narL(+) strains. This 
indicates that acetate metabolism has complex roles in mediating NarL cross 
talk. Contrariwise, cross talk was sharply diminished in an arcB barA double 
null strain, suggesting that the encoded sensors contribute substantially to 
NarL V88A cross talk. Separately, the V88A substitution altered the in vitro 
rates of NarL autodephosphorylation and transmitter-stimulated dephosphorylation 
and decreased affinity for the cognate sensor, NarX. Together, these experiments 
show that the residue at position T + 1 can strongly influence two distinct 
aspects of receiver domain function, the autodephosphorylation rate and cross 
talk inhibition.
IMPORTANCE: Many bacterial species contain a dozen or more discrete 
sensor-response regulator two-component systems that convert a specific input 
into a distinct output pattern. Cross talk, the unwanted transfer of signals 
between circuits, occurs when a response regulator is phosphorylated 
inappropriately from a noncognate source. Cross talk is inhibited in part by the 
high interaction specificity between cognate sensor-response regulator pairs. 
This study shows that a relatively subtle missense change from Val to Ala 
nullifies cross talk inhibition, enabling at least two noncognate sensors to 
enforce an inappropriate output independently of the relevant input.

Two-component signal transduction involves phosphoryl transfer between a 
histidine kinase sensor and a response regulator effector. The 
nitrate-responsive two-component signal transduction systems in Escherichia coli 
represent a paradigm for a cross-regulation network, in which the paralogous 
sensor-response regulator pairs, NarX-NarL and NarQ-NarP, exhibit both cognate 
(e.g. NarX-NarL) and non-cognate (e.g. NarQ-NarL) interactions to control 
output. Here, we describe results from bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid 
(BACTH) analysis to examine sensor dimerization as well as interaction between 
sensor-response regulator cognate and non-cognate pairs. Although results from 
BACTH analysis indicated that the NarX and NarQ sensors interact with each 
other, results from intragenic complementation tests demonstrate that they do 
not form functional heterodimers. Additionally, intragenic complementation shows 
that both NarX and NarQ undergo intermolecular autophosphorylation, deviating 
from the previously reported correlation between DHp (dimerization and histidyl 
phosphotransfer) domain loop handedness and autophosphorylation mode. Results 
from BACTH analysis revealed robust interactions for the NarX-NarL, NarQ-NarL 
and NarQ-NarP pairs but a much weaker interaction for the NarX-NarP pair. This 
demonstrates that asymmetrical cross-regulation results from differential 
binding affinities between different sensor-regulator pairs. Finally, results 
indicate that the NarL effector (DNA-binding) domain inhibits NarX-NarL 
interaction. Missense substitutions at receiver domain residue Ser-80 enhanced 
NarX-NarL interaction, apparently by destabilizing the NarL receiver-effector 
domain interface.

A Crp-dependent two-component system regulates nitrate and nitrite respiration 
in Shewanella oneidensis.

We have previously illustrated the nitrate/nitrite respiratory pathway of 
Shewanella oneidensis, which is renowned for its remarkable versatility in 
respiration. Here we investigated the systems regulating the pathway with a 
reliable approach which enables characterization of mutants impaired in 
nitrate/nitrite respiration by guaranteeing biomass. The S. oneidensis genome 
encodes an Escherichia coli NarQ/NarX homolog SO3981 and two E. coli NarP/NarL 
homologs SO1860 and SO3982. Results of physiological characterization and 
mutational analyses demonstrated that S. oneidensis possesses a single 
two-component system (TCS) for regulation of nitrate/nitrite respiration, 
consisting of the sensor kinase SO3981(NarQ) and the response regulator 
SO3982(NarP). The TCS directly controls the transcription of nap and nrfA (genes 
encoding nitrate and nitrite reductases, respectively) but regulates the former 
less tightly than the latter. Additionally, phosphorylation at residue 57 of 
SO3982 is essential for its DNA-binding capacity. At the global control level, 
Crp is found to regulate expression of narQP as well as nap and nrfA. In 
contrast to NarP-NarQ, Crp is more essential for nap rather than nrfA.

Legless pathogens: how bacterial physiology provides the key to understanding 
pathogenicity.

Cole JA(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.

This review argues that knowledge of microbial physiology and metabolism is a 
prerequisite to understanding mechanisms of pathogenicity. The ability of 
Neisseria gonorrhoeae to cope with stresses such as those found during infection 
requires a sialyltransferase to sialylate its lipopolysaccharide using 
host-derived CMP-NANA in the human bloodstream, the ability to oxidize lactate 
that is abundant in the human body, outer-membrane lipoproteins that provide the 
first line of protection against oxidative and nitrosative stress, regulation of 
NO reduction independently from the nitrite reductase that forms NO, an extra 
haem group on the C-terminal extension of a cytochrome oxidase subunit, and a 
respiratory capacity far in excess of metabolic requirements. These properties 
are all normal components of neisserial physiology; they would all fail rigid 
definitions of a pathogenicity determinant. In anaerobic cultures of enteric 
bacteria, duplicate pathways for nitrate reduction to ammonia provide a 
selective advantage when nitrate is either abundant or scarce. Selection of 
these alternative pathways is in part regulated by two parallel two-component 
regulatory systems. NarX-NarL primarily ensures that nitrate is reduced in 
preference to thermodynamically less favourable terminal electron acceptors, but 
NarQ-NarP facilitates reduction of limited quantities of nitrate or other, less 
favourable, terminal electron acceptors in preference to fermentative growth. 
How enteric bacteria repair damage caused by nitrosative and oxidative damage 
inflicted by host defences is less well understood. In both N. gonorrhoeae and 
Escherichia coli, parallel pathways that duplicate particular biochemical 
functions are far from redundant, but fulfil specific physiological roles.

An iTRAQ-based comparative and quantitative proteomics analysis of a soil-borne 
Mn(II)-oxidizing bacterium, Escherichia coli MB266, was conducted during the 
exponential and stationary growth phases. A total of 1850 proteins were 
identified in 4 samples, of which 373 and 456 proteins were significantly up- or 
down-regulated in at least one pairwise comparison, respectively. The iTRAQ data 
indicated that several enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism (i.e., FabA, 
FabD and FabZ) and pyruvate metabolism (particularly pyruvate oxidase PoxB) were 
significantly up-regulated, while those related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle 
(such as FrdB, FumB and AcnA) and methylcitrate cycle (i.e., PrpC) were 
inactivated in the presence of 1 mM Mn(II); the amounts of some stress response 
and signal transduction system-related proteins (i.e., Spy) were remarkably 
increased, and the cold shock protein CspD was significantly up-regulated during 
the exponential growth phase. However, all verified heat shock proteins remained 
unchanged. The reactive oxygen species response and some redox enzymes might 
also be involved in Mn oxidation processes. The involvement of several cellular 
proteins in Mn(II) oxidation, including PoxB, Spy and MCO266, was further 
confirmed by gene disruption and expression complementation experiments. Based 
on these results, a signal transduction mechanism coupled to Mn oxidation was 
proposed.

AcnC of Escherichia coli is a 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (PrpD) that can use 
citrate and isocitrate as substrates.

Escherichia coli possesses two well-characterized aconitases (AcnA and AcnB) and 
a minor activity (designated AcnC) that is retained by acnAB double mutants and 
represents no more than 5% of total wild-type aconitase activity. Here it is 
shown that a 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (PrpD) encoded by the prpD gene of the 
propionate catabolic operon (prpRBCDE) is identical to AcnC. Inactivation of 
prpD abolished the residual aconitase activity of an AcnAB-null strain, whereas 
inactivation of ybhJ, an unidentified acnA paralogue, had no significant effect 
on AcnC activity. Purified PrpD catalysed the dehydration of citrate and 
isocitrate but was most active with 2-methylcitrate. PrpD also catalysed the 
dehydration of several other hydroxy acids but failed to hydrate cis-aconitate 
and related substrates containing double bonds, indicating that PrpD is not a 
typical aconitase but a dehydratase. Purified PrpD was shown to be a monomeric 
iron-sulphur protein (M(r) 54000) having one unstable [2Fe-2S] cluster per 
monomer, which is needed for maximum catalytic activity and can be reconstituted 
by treatment with Fe(2+) under reducing conditions.

Probing the ArcA-P modulon of Escherichia coli by whole genome transcriptional 
analysis and sequence recognition profiling.

Boston, MA 02115, USA.

The ArcB/ArcA two-component signal transduction system of Escherichia coli 
regulates gene expression in response to the redox conditions of growth. Over 
the years, genetic screens have lead to the identification of about 30 
ArcA-P-controlled operons that are involved in redox metabolism. However, the 
discovery of 3 targets that are not implicated in respiratory metabolism (the 
tra operon for plasmid conjugation, psi site for Xer-based recombination, and 
oriC site for chromosome replication) suggests that the Arc modulon may comprise 
additional operons that are involved in a myriad of functions. To identify these 
operons, we derived the ArcA-P-dependent transcription profile of E. coli using 
oligonucleotide-based microarray analysis. The findings indicated that 9% of all 
open reading frames in E. coli are affected either directly or indirectly by 
ArcA-P. To identify which operons are under the direct control of ArcA-P, we 
developed the ArcA-P recognition weight matrix from footprinting data and used 
it to scan the genome, yielding an ArcA-P sequence affinity map. By overlaying 
both methods, we identified 55 new Arc-regulated operons that are implicated in 
energy metabolism, transport, survival, catabolism, and transcriptional 
regulation. The data also suggest that the Arc response pathway, which 
translates into a net global downscaling of gene expression, overlaps partly 
with the FNR regulatory network. A conservative but reasonable assessment is 
that the Arc pathway recruits 100-150 operons to mediate a role in cellular 
adaptation that is more extensive than hitherto anticipated.

We have previously reported the isolation of a group of anaerobically regulated, 
fnr-dependent lac fusions in Salmonella typhimurium and have grouped these oxd 
genes into classes based on map position. In order to identify these genes, we 
have replaced the original Mud-lac fusion in a member of each oxd class with the 
much smaller Mud-cam element, cloned the fusion, and determined DNA sequence 
sufficient to define the oxd gene. Several of the fusions correspond to 
previously known genes from S. typhimurium or Escherichia coli: oxd-4 = cbiA and 
oxd-11 = cbiK, oxd-5 = hybB, oxd-7 = dcuB, oxd-8 = moaB, oxd-12 = dmsA, and 
oxd-14 = napB (aeg-46. 5). Two other fusions correspond to previously unknown 
loci: oxd-2 encodes an acetate/propionate kinase, and oxd-6 encodes a putative 
ABC transporter present in S. typhimurium but not in E. coli.

Cleavage of chromosomal DNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO by Spel and Dpnl has 
been used together with PFGE and Southern hybridization to establish the map 
location of the following principal denitrification genes: narGH (encoding the 
large and small subunits of respiratory nitrate reductase), nirS (cytochrome-cd1 
nitrite reductase), nirE (uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase for haem d1 
biosynthesis), norCB (nitric-oxide reductase complex), nosZ (nitrous-oxide 
reductase) and nosA (an outer-membrane protein and OprC homologue). The study 
also included several genes related to anaerobic or microaerophilic metabolism: 
napA (encoding the catalytic subunit of the periplasmic nitrate reductase), ccoN 
(catalytic subunit of the cytochrome-cbb3 oxidase), hemN (oxygen-independent 
coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase), an fnr-like regulatory gene, and azu and fdxA 
(electron carriers azurin and ferredoxin, respectively). Genes necessary for 
denitrification are concentrated at 20 to 36 min on the P. aeruginosa 
chromosome, where they form three separate loci, the nir-nor, nar and nos gene 
clusters. Genomic DNA of Pseudomonas stutzeri ZoBell was also subjected to Spel 
restriction and Southern analysis to assign denitrification genes to individual 
fragments. A homologue of nosA encoding a putative component of the 
Cu-processing apparatus for nitrous-oxide reductase was identified. In both P. 
aeruginosa and P. stutzeri there is evidence for the linkage of anr (fnrA) with 
hemN and ccoN; and for the presence of a napA gene.

A geographically widespread plasmid from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans has genes for

During a search for genes encoding electron transport proteins from a 
Thiobacillus ferroxidans ATCC 33020 gene bank, a 19.8 kb plasmid, pTF5, which 
conferred increased sensitivity to the antimicrobial agent metronidazole upon an 
Escherichia coli mutant, was isolated and cloned in E. coli. The plasmid had an 
identical restriction enzyme map to a plasmid which has been found in T. 
ferrooxidans strains isolated from many different parts of the world. The 
plasmid was present at between two and four copies per genome and contained a 
region of approximately 5-6 kb which was also found on the chromosome. This 
region was sequenced and found to have four complete ORFs, which when translated 
had high percentage amino acid similarity to [3Fe-4S,4Fe-4S] ferredoxins, 
proteins of the FNR regulator family, prismane-like proteins and the NADH 
oxidoreductase subunit of a methane monooxygenase. In vitro protein analysis 
using an E. coli-derived transcription-translation system indicated that three 
of the four products (FdxA, PsmA and RedA) were expressed in the heterologous 
system. Ferredoxins, prismane-like proteins and NADH oxidoreductases are 
redox-active proteins and it is likely that the proteins on pTF5 represent an 
electron transport system of as yet unknown function. Surprisingly, although 
genes for redox-active proteins have been isolated from other bacteria by 
screening gene banks for increased sensitivity to metronidazole, the region of 
pTF5 containing the genes for these proteins was not responsible for the 
increase in metronidazole sensitivity conferred by the plasmid. The region of 
pTF5 which did confer increased metronidazole sensitivity to an E. coli 
metronidazole-resistant mutant was a 319 bp region of DNA close to the origin of 
plasmid replication. This region contained no ORFs and was identical to that 
previously reported for the replicon of a 9.8 kb T. ferrooxidans plasmid, 
pTF191.

The expression of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) from Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 in 
heterocysts and vegetative cells has been quantified. Specific reductase 
activity in heterocysts was approximately 10 times higher than in vegetative 
cells, corresponding to the increased FNR protein content. This was confirmed by 
immunoquantification of the FNR protein from whole filaments of Anabaena sp. PCC 
7120 grown in media with and without combined nitrogen. Transcription of the 
petH gene was markedly enhanced in the absence of combined nitrogen. This 
suggests that the increased RNA level is mainly responsible for the 
up-regulation of FNR in heterocysts. As has been observed for nif genes, iron 
deficiency also increased transcription of petH. Characterization of the FNR 
purified from isolated heterocysts showed no detectable differences from the 
enzyme from vegetative cells. Although nitrogen stress was a key regulatory 
factor, localization of the petH gene in the genomic map of Anabaena PCC 7120 
showed that this gene is not physically associated with the nif cluster.

Escherichia coli K-12 genes essential for the synthesis of c-type cytochromes 
and a third nitrate reductase located in the periplasm.

Grove J(1), Tanapongpipat S, Thomas G, Griffiths L, Crooke H, Cole J.

Author information:
(1)School of Biochemistry, University of Birmingham, UK.

The 'aeg46.5' operon was originally detected as an 'anaerobically expressed 
gene' located at minute 46.5 on the Escherichia coli linkage map. Subsequent 
results from the E. coli Genome Sequencing Project revealed that the 'aeg46.5' 
promoter was located in the centisome 49 (minute 47) region. Downstream from 
this promoter are 15 genes, seven of which are predicted to encode a periplasmic 
nitrate reductase and eight encode proteins homologous to proteins essential for 
cytochrome c assembly in other bacteria. All of these genes, together with the 
'aeg46.5' promoter, have been subcloned on a 20kb EcoRI fragment from Kohara 
phage 19D1. Evidence is presented that, as predicted, the region includes 
structural genes for two c-type cytochromes of mass 16kDa and 24 kDa, which are 
transcribed from the previously described 'aeg46.5' promoter, and that the first 
seven genes encode a functional nitrate reductase. We, therefore, propose that 
they should be designated nap (nitrate reductase in the periplasm) genes. 
Plasmids encoding the entire 20kb region, or only the downstream eight genes, 
complemented five mutations resulting in total absence of all five known c-type 
cytochromes in E coli, providing biochemical evidence that these are ccm (for 
cytochrome c maturation) genes. The ccm region was transcribed both from the 
FNR-dependent, NarL- and NarP-regulated nap promoter (formerly the 'aeg46.5' 
promoter) and from constitutive or weakly regulated promoters apparently located 
within the downstream nap and ccm genes.

Nitrate and nitrite regulation of the Fnr-dependent aeg-46.5 promoter of 
Escherichia coli K-12 is mediated by competition between homologous response 
regulators (NarL and NarP) for a common DNA-binding site.

Darwin AJ(1), Stewart V.

Author information:
(1)Section of Microbiology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-8101, USA.

The NarL and NarP proteins are homologous response regulators that function to 
regulate anaerobic respiratory gene expression in response to nitrate and 
nitrite in Escherichia coli. Expression of the aeg-46.5 operon (anaerobically 
expressed gene at 46.5 minutes on the genetic map) is induced during anaerobic 
growth by the global transcriptional regulatory protein Fnr. aeg-46.5 operon 
expression is further induced by the NarP protein in response to nitrate or 
nitrite and this induction is antagonized by NarL. We used in vivo and in vitro 
techniques to investigate how these three transcriptional regulatory proteins 
control the activity of a single promoter. Deletion and mutational analysis of 
the aeg-46.5 operon control region identified two distinct cis-acting elements. 
A sequence with similarity to the Fnr-binding site consensus, centered at 
position -64.5, was essential for Fnr-dependent anaerobic induction of aeg-46.5 
operon expression. In all other naturally occurring Fnr-dependent promoters the 
primary Fnr-binding site is centered between -40 and -50. The second cis-acting 
element, a region of perfect symmetry centered at -44.5, shares sequence 
similarity with the NarL-binding site consensus. This region was required for 
nitrate and nitrite induction of aeg-46.5 operon expression. We purified the 
NarP and NarL proteins as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins and 
investigated their interaction with the aeg-46.5 operon control region. 
Incubation with the phospho-donor, acetyl phosphate, allowed both MBP-NarP and 
MBP-NarL to protect the -44.5 region of the aeg-46.5 operon control region from 
DNase I cleavage. Single and double nucleotide substitutions in the -44.5 region 
reduced or abolished nitrate and nitrite induction of aeg-46.5 operon expression 
in vivo and prevented the binding of MBP-NarP and MBP-NarL to the control region 
in vitro. Presumably, the NarP and NarL proteins compete for the -44.5 binding 
site to regulate aeg-46.5 operon expression in response to nitrate and nitrite. 
Apparently, only the NarP protein is competent to activate transcription of the 
aeg-46.5 operon when bound to the -44.5 region.

Anaerobic activation of the entire denitrification pathway in Pseudomonas

The Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene anr, which encodes a structural and functional 
analog of the anaerobic regulator Fnr in Escherichia coli, was mapped to the 
SpeI fragment R, which is at about 59 min on the genomic map of P. aeruginosa 
PAO1. Wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 grew under anaerobic conditions with nitrate, 
nitrite, and nitrous oxide as alternative electron acceptors. An anr deletion 
mutant, PAO6261, was constructed. It was unable to grow with these alternative 
electron acceptors; however, its ability to denitrify was restored upon the 
introduction of the wild-type anr gene. In addition, the activities of two 
enzymes in the denitrification pathway, nitrite reductase and nitric oxide 
reductase, were not detectable under oxygen-limiting conditions in strain 
PAO6261 but were restored when complemented with the anr+ gene. These results 
indicate that the anr gene product plays a key role in anaerobically activating 
the entire denitrification pathway.

Transcriptional control of the nuo operon which encodes the energy-conserving 
NADH dehydrogenase of Salmonella typhimurium.

Author information:
(1)Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35294, USA.

The 14 nuo genes encode the subunits of the type I (energy-conserving) NADH 
dehydrogenase, a key component of the respiratory chain. Salmonella typhimurium, 
like Escherichia coli, has two enzymes that can oxidize NADH and transfer 
electrons to ubiquinone, but only the type I enzyme translocates protons across 
the membrane to generate a proton motive force. Cells with the type I enzyme are 
energetically more efficient; the role of the type II enzyme (encoded by ndh) is 
not established, but it may function like a relief valve to allow more rapid 
NADH recycling. Here, we have investigated transcription of the nuo gene 
cluster, primarily in S. typhimurium. Studies with polar insertion mutants 
demonstrate that these genes are arranged as a single, large operon that is 
expressed from a complex promoter region upstream of nuoA. The DNA sequence of 
the promoter region was determined, and primer extension analysis of nuo 
transcripts was used to map four major RNA 5' ends to this region. A set of lac 
operon fusions to various DNA segments from the nuo promoter region was also 
constructed. Analysis of these fusions confirmed the presence of at least two 
nuo promoters. Mutations in the global regulatory genes arcA, oxrA (fnr), crp, 
cya, and katF were tested for effects on expression of the nuo operon. However, 
none of the mutations tested had a large effect on expression of type I NADH 
dehydrogenase.

The structural gene, nrfA, for cytochrome c552, which is the terminal reductase 
of the formate-dependent pathway for nitrite reduction to ammonia, has been 
located at co-ordinate 4366 on the physical map of the Escherichia coli 
chromosome. The DNA sequence of nrfA encodes a tetrahaem c-type cytochrome with 
a predicted M(r) for the unprocessed product of 53,788. Cleavage of the putative 
signal peptide at Ala-26 would result in a mature, periplasmic cytochrome of 
M(r) 50,580 rather than a larger hexahaem cytochrome, as has been widely 
reported previously. A cytochrome of this size was detected by staining 
SDS-polyacrylamide gels for covalently bound haem. This cytochrome was partially 
purified by anion exchange chromatography and confirmed to be cytochrome c552 by 
difference spectroscopy. Similar cytochromes were detected in five other E. coli 
strains including strain ST 249, which was used previously to purify and 
characterize the protein. A plasmid with an in-phase deletion within nrfA 
directed the synthesis of a truncated haemoprotein of the predicted mass. 
In-phase translational fusions to lacZ were used to locate the nrfA translation 
start, and the transcription start site was found by S1 mapping. Expression from 
the FNR-dependent nrfA promoter was almost totally repressed during aerobic 
growth, partially induced during anaerobic growth in the absence of nitrite or 
in the presence of nitrate, but fully induced only during anaerobic growth in 
the presence of nitrite. No nitrate repression was detected in a narL mutant, 
but nitrite induction was unaffected, indicating that the nitrite-sensing 
mechanism is independent of the NarL protein. Expression from the nrfA promoter 
was subject to glucose repression but regulation was independent of the CRP-cAMP 
complex.

Effect of acidic condition on the fermentation characteristics was investigated 
by the continuous culture of Escherichia coli. In accordance with 
down-regulation of crp gene transcript level as well as up-regulation of arcA, 
the expressions of the TCA cycle genes were down-regulated, which caused more 
acetate formation at acidic condition under aerobic condition. It was also shown 
that yfiD was up-regulated in accordance with up-regulation of fnr, and the 
respiratory pathway genes were up-regulated under acidic condition. The effect 
of phoB gene knockout on fermentation characteristics was also investigated. 
Under micro-aerobic condition, the fermentation pattern changed in such a way 
that formate and lactate were more produced at lower pH due to up-regulations of 
pflA, yfiD and ldhA genes, whereas ethanol was less produced as compared to the 
case at neutral pH. The overall regulation mechanism under acidic condition was 
clarified based on fermentation characteristics and gene transcript levels.

Regulation of the ldhA gene, encoding the fermentative lactate dehydrogenase of 
Escherichia coli.

The fermentative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of Escherichia coli is induced by 
low pH under anaerobic conditions. Both translational and transcriptional gene 
fusions to ldhA, which encodes the fermentative LDH, have now been made. Both 
types of ldhA-lacZ fusion were induced by low pH, but only in the absence of 
air. However, the translational fusions were consistently expressed at a five- 
to tenfold higher level than the transcriptional fusions, perhaps implying some 
post-transcriptional effect on ldhA expression. Introduction of arcB::Kan 
decreased expression of both translational and transcriptional ldhA-lacZ fusions 
by three- to fivefold. Disruption of mlc, which encodes a repressor of several 
genes of the phosphotransferase system, almost abolished expression of ldhA. 
Disruption of csrA caused a moderate drop in expression of both operon and 
protein ldhA fusions, whereas insertional inactivation of csrB or glgA had the 
opposite effect. These effects are probably indirect, resulting from alterations 
in sugar accumulation versus storage. Mutations in ptsG, cra, fnr, narL, rpoS, 
osmZ, appY, ack/pta, aceEF, pfl and ldhA had no effect on expression of the ldhA 
fusions. ldhA was not induced by the membrane-permeant weak acid benzoate, 
implying that it does not respond to the internal pH directly. Little pH 
induction was seen during growth on glycerol plus fumarate, suggesting that 
products of sugar fermentation are necessary for acid induction. Addition of 
succinate, acetate or lactate had no effect on ldhA expression. In contrast, 
pyruvate caused a two- to fourfold increase in expression of ldhA-lacZ. This 
accords with the idea that increased sugar metabolism indirectly induces ldhA.

Bacillus subtilis grows in the absence of oxygen using nitrate ammonification 
and various fermentation processes. Lactate, acetate, and 2,3-butanediol were 
identified in the growth medium as the major anaerobic fermentation products by 
using high-performance liquid chromatography. Lactate formation was found to be 
dependent on the lctEP locus, encoding lactate dehydrogenase and a putative 
lactate permease. Mutation of lctE results in drastically reduced anaerobic 
growth independent of the presence of alternative electron acceptors, indicating 
the importance of NADH reoxidation by lactate dehydrogenase for the overall 
anaerobic energy metabolism. Anaerobic formation of 2,3-butanediol via acetoin 
involves acetolactate synthase and decarboxylase encoded by the alsSD operon. 
Mutation of alsSD has no significant effect on anaerobic growth. Anaerobic 
acetate synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A requires phosphotransacetylase encoded 
by pta. Similar to the case for lctEP, mutation of pta significantly reduces 
anaerobic fermentative and respiratory growth. The expression of both lctEP and 
alsSD is strongly induced under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic lctEP and alsSD 
induction was found to be partially dependent on the gene encoding the redox 
regulator Fnr. The observed fnr dependence might be the result of Fnr-induced 
arfM (ywiD) transcription and subsequent lctEP and alsSD activation by the 
regulator ArfM (YwiD). The two-component regulatory system encoded by resDE is 
also involved in anaerobic lctEP induction. No direct resDE influence on the 
redox regulation of alsSD was observed. The alternative electron acceptor 
nitrate represses anaerobic lctEP and alsSD transcription. Nitrate repression 
requires resDE- and fnr-dependent expression of narGHJI, encoding respiratory 
nitrate reductase. The gene alsR, encoding a regulator potentially responding to 
changes of the intracellular pH and to acetate, is essential for anaerobic lctEP 
and alsSD expression. In agreement with its known aerobic function, no obvious 
oxygen- or nitrate-dependent pta regulation was observed. A model for the 
regulation of the anaerobic fermentation genes in B. subtilis is proposed.

Expression of Escherichia coli pyruvate oxidase (PoxB) depends on the sigma 
factor encoded by the rpoS(katF) gene.

The activity of Escherichia coli pyruvate oxidase (PoxB) was shown to be 
growth-phase dependent; the enzyme activity reaches a maximum at early 
stationary phase. We report that PoxB activity is dependent on a functional 
rpoS(katF) gene which encodes a sigma factor required to transcribe a number of 
stationary-phase-induced genes. PoxB activity as well as the beta-galactosidase 
encoded by a poxB::lacZ protein fusion was completely abolished in a strain 
containing a defective rpoS gene. Northern and primer extension analyses showed 
that poxB expression was regulated at the transcriptional level and was 
transcribed from a single promoter; the 5' end of the mRNA being located 27 bp 
upstream of the translational initiation codon of poxB. The poxB gene was 
expressed at decreased levels under anaerobiosis; however, the anaerobic 
regulatory genes arcA, arcB or fnr were not involved in anaerobic poxB gene 
expression. Expression of the rpoS(katF) gene has been reported to be affected 
by acetate, the product of PoxB reaction. However, we found that poxB null 
mutations had no effect on rpoS(katF) expression. Inactivation of two genes 
involved in acetate metabolism, ackA and pta, had no effect on either poxB or 
rpoS(katF) expression.

FNR-mediated regulation of hyp expression in Escherichia coli.

Biology and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 
2TN, UK.

The hypA-E operon is involved in the maturation of all three NiFe hydrogenases 
in Escherichia coli. Two hyp promoters have been described; a sigma54-dependent 
promoter upstream of hypA, and a sigma70-dependent promoter (PhypA) within the 
hypA coding region. Here it is shown that the oxygen-responsive transcription 
factor FNR regulates PhypA under anaerobic conditions only. PhypA does not 
possess a canonical FNR recognition sequence, but two FNR half-sites are 
present. Studies using PHYPA::lacZ fusions carrying lesions in one or both FNR 
half-sites indicated that although some residual anaerobic activity was retained 
by the promoter containing only the downstream FNR half-site, both half-sites 
are required for maximal PhypA activity in vivo. In vitro gel retardation 
analysis suggested that the primary interaction occurs at the downstream FNR 
half-site. Possible explanations for these observations and the implications for 
other FNR-regulated promoters are discussed.

The 58/59 min region of the Escherichia coli chromosome contains two divergently 
oriented gene clusters coding for proteins with a function in hydrogenase 
formation. One cluster (the hyc operon), transcribed counterclockwise with 
respect to the E. coli chromosome, codes for gene products with a structural 
role in hydrogenase 3 formation (Böhm et al., 1990). The nucleotide sequence of 
the divergently transcribed operon (hyp) has been determined. It contains five 
genes, all of which are expressed in vivo in a T7 promoter/polymerase system, 
and the sizes of the synthesized products correspond with those predicted from 
the amino acid sequence. Complementation analysis of previously characterized 
mutants showed that the hypB, hypC and hypD genes have a function in the 
formation of all three hydrogenase isoenzymes, lesions in hypB being 
complemented by high nickel ion concentration in the medium. Prevention of 
hypBCDE gene expression led to an altered electrophoretic pattern of hydrogenase 
1 and 2 constituent subunits, indicating increased chemical or proteolytic 
subunits, Under fermentative growth conditions, operon expression was governed 
by an NtrA-dependent promoter lying upstream of hypA working together with an 
fnr gene product-dependent promoter which was localized within the hypA gene. 
The latter (operon-internal) promoter is responsible for hypBCDE transcription 
under non-fermentative conditions when the -24/-12 NtrA-dependent promoter 
upstream of hypA is silent.

Eighteen strains of Escherichia coli were compared for maximum specific growth 
rate (μ MAX) on 85 mM acetate as the sole carbon source. The C strain ATCC8739 
had the greatest growth rate (0.41 h(-1)) while SCS-1 had the slowest growth 
rate (0.15 h(-1)). Transcriptional analysis of three of the strains (ATCC8739, 
BL21, SMS-3-5) was conducted to elucidate why ATCC8739 had the greatest maximum 
growth rate. Seventy-one genes were upregulated 2-fold or greater in ATCC8739, 
while 128 genes were downregulated 2-fold or greater in ATCC8739 compared to 
BL21 and SMS-3-5. To generate a strain that could grow more quickly on acetate, 
ATCC8739 was cultured in a chemostat using a progressively increasing dilution 
rate. When the dilution rate reached 0.50 h(-1), three isolated colonies each 
grew faster than ATCC8739 on 85 mM acetate, with MEC136 growing the fastest with 
a growth rate of 0.51 h(-1), about 25 % greater than ATCC8739. Transcriptional 
analysis of MEC136 showed that eight genes were downregulated 2-fold or greater 
and one gene was upregulated 2-fold or greater compared to ATCC8739. Genomic 
sequencing revealed that MEC136 contained a single mutation, causing a serine to 
proline change in amino acid 266 of RpoA, the α subunit of the RNA polymerase 
core enzyme. The 260-270 amino acid region of RpoA has been shown to be a key 
region of the protein that affects the interaction of the α subunit of the RNA 
polymerase core enzyme with several global transcriptional activators, such as 
CRP and FNR.

Transcription activation at class I FNR-dependent promoters: identification of 
the activating surface of FNR and the corresponding contact site in the 
C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit.

A library of random mutations in the Escherichia coli fnr gene has been screened 
to identify positive control mutants of FNR that are defective in transcription 
activation at Class I promoters. Single amino acid substitutions at D43, R72, 
S73, T118, M120, F181, F186, S187 and F191 identify a surface of FNR that is 
essential for activation which, presumably, makes contact with the C-terminal 
domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit. This surface is larger than the 
corresponding activating surface of the related transcription activator, CRP. To 
identify the contact surface in the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase 
alpha subunit, a library of mutations in the rpoA gene was screened for alpha 
mutants that interfered with transcription activation at Class I FNR-dependent 
promoters. Activation was reduced by deletions of the alpha C-terminal domain, 
by substitutions known to affect DNA binding by alpha, by substitutions at E261 
and by substitutions at L300, E302, D305, A308, G315 and R317 that appear to 
identify contact surfaces of alpha that are likely to make contact with FNR at 
Class I promoters. Again, this surface differs from the surface used by CRP at 
Class I CRP-dependent promoters.

Transcription activation in vitro by the Bradyrhizobium japonicum regulatory 
protein FixK2.

In Bradyrhizobium japonicum, the N2-fixing root nodule endosymbiont of soybean, 
a group of genes required for microaerobic, anaerobic, or symbiotic growth is 
controlled by FixK2, a key regulator that is part of the FixLJ-FixK2 cascade. 
FixK2 belongs to the family of cyclic AMP receptor protein/fumarate and nitrate 
reductase (CRP/FNR) transcription factors that recognize a palindromic DNA motif 
(CRP/FNR box) associated with the regulated promoters. Here, we report on a 
biochemical analysis of FixK2 and its transcription activation activity in 
vitro. FixK2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as a soluble 
N-terminally histidine-tagged protein. Gel filtration experiments revealed that 
increasing the protein concentration shifts the monomer-dimer equilibrium toward 
the dimer. Purified FixK2 productively interacted with the B. japonicum 
sigma80-RNA polymerase holoenzyme, but not with E. coli sigma70-RNA polymerase 
holoenzyme, to activate transcription from the B. japonicum fixNOQP, fixGHIS, 
and hemN2 promoters in vitro. Furthermore, FixK2 activated transcription from 
the E. coli FF(-41.5) model promoter, again only in concert with B. japonicum 
RNA polymerase. All of these promoters are so-called class II CRP/FNR-type 
promoters. We showed by specific mutagenesis that the FixK2 box at nucleotide 
position -40.5 in the hemN2 promoter, but not that at -78.5, is crucial for 
activation both in vivo and in vitro, which argues against recognition of a 
potential class III promoter. Given the lack of any evidence for the presence of 
a cofactor in purified FixK2, we surmise that FixK2 alone is sufficient to 
activate in vitro transcription to at least a basal level. This contrasts with 
all well-studied CRP/FNR-type proteins, which do require coregulators.

Multiple transcription factors of the FNR family in denitrifying Pseudomonas 
stutzeri: characterization of four fnr-like genes, regulatory responses and 
cognate metabolic processes.

Pseudomonas stutzeri is a facultative anaerobic bacterium with the capability of 
denitrification. In searching for regulators that control the expression of this 
trait in response to oxygen withdrawal, we have found an unprecedented 
multiplicity of four genes encoding transcription factors of the FNR family. The 
fnrA gene encodes a genuine FNR-type regulator, which is expressed 
constitutively and controls the cytochrome cbb3-type terminal oxidase (the cco 
operon), cytochrome c peroxidase (the ccp gene) and the oxygen-independent 
coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (the hemN gene), in addition to its previously 
demonstrated role in arginine catabolism (the arc operon). The fnr homologues 
dnrD, dnrE and dnrS encode regulators of a new subgroup within the FNR family. 
Their main distinctive feature is the lack of cysteine residues for complexing 
the [4Fe-4S] centre of redox-active FNR-type regulators. However, they form a 
phylogenetic lineage separate from the FixK branch of FNR proteins, which also 
lack this cysteine signature. We have studied the expression of the dnr genes 
under aerobic, oxygen-limited and denitrifying conditions. DnrD is a key 
regulator of denitrification by selective activation of the genes for cytochrome 
cd1 nitrite reductase and NO reductase. The dnrD gene is part of the 30 kb 
region carrying denitrification genes of P. stutzeri. Transcription of dnrD was 
activated in O2-limited cells and particularly strongly in denitrifying cells, 
but was not under the control of FnrA. In response to denitrifying growth 
conditions, dnrD was transcribed as part of an operon together with genes 
downstream and upstream of dnrD. dnrS was found about 9 kb upstream of dnrD, 
next to the nrdD gene for anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase. The transcription 
of dnrS required FnrA in O2-limited cells. Mutation of dnrS affected nrdD and 
the expression of ferredoxin I as an element of the oxidative stress response. 
The dnrE gene is part of the nar region encoding functions for respiratory 
nitrate reduction. We found the highest amount of dnrE transcripts in 
aerobically nitrate-challenged cells. The gene was transcribed from two 
promoters, P1 and P2, of which promoter P1 was under the control of the nitrate 
response regulator NarL. The multiplicity of FNR factors in P. stutzeri 
underlines the versatility of the FNR scaffold to serve for transcriptional 
regulation directed at anaerobic or nitrate-activated metabolic processes.

Cleavage of chromosomal DNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO by Spel and Dpnl has 
been used together with PFGE and Southern hybridization to establish the map 
location of the following principal denitrification genes: narGH (encoding the 
large and small subunits of respiratory nitrate reductase), nirS (cytochrome-cd1 
nitrite reductase), nirE (uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase for haem d1 
biosynthesis), norCB (nitric-oxide reductase complex), nosZ (nitrous-oxide 
reductase) and nosA (an outer-membrane protein and OprC homologue). The study 
also included several genes related to anaerobic or microaerophilic metabolism: 
napA (encoding the catalytic subunit of the periplasmic nitrate reductase), ccoN 
(catalytic subunit of the cytochrome-cbb3 oxidase), hemN (oxygen-independent 
coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase), an fnr-like regulatory gene, and azu and fdxA 
(electron carriers azurin and ferredoxin, respectively). Genes necessary for 
denitrification are concentrated at 20 to 36 min on the P. aeruginosa 
chromosome, where they form three separate loci, the nir-nor, nar and nos gene 
clusters. Genomic DNA of Pseudomonas stutzeri ZoBell was also subjected to Spel 
restriction and Southern analysis to assign denitrification genes to individual 
fragments. A homologue of nosA encoding a putative component of the 
Cu-processing apparatus for nitrous-oxide reductase was identified. In both P. 
aeruginosa and P. stutzeri there is evidence for the linkage of anr (fnrA) with 
hemN and ccoN; and for the presence of a napA gene.

Bioconversion processes of organic acid or acid hydrolysis of raw material for 
microbial metabolism often suffer limitations as a result of microbial 
sensitivity in low-pH conditions. We adopted a three-step method called RAndom 
Insertional-deletional Strand Exchange mutagenesis (RAISE) to engineer the 
components of global regulator Sigma D factor (RpoD) of Escherichia coli to 
improve its acid tolerance. The best strain Mutant VII was identified from 
random mutagenesis libraries based on the growth performance, which exhibited 
much higher growth rate than the control (0.22h(-1) vs. 0.15h(-1)) at pH as low 
as 3.17. Combined transcriptome and phenome analysis of E. coli was carried out 
to better understand the global effects of RpoD on the regulatory networks. Our 
analysis showed that 95 (2.1%) of all E. coli genes were induced and 178 (4.0%) 
genes were repressed, including those for trehalose biosynthesis, nucleotides 
biosynthesis, carbon metabolism, amino acid utilization, except for acid 
resistance. Also regulated were the master regulators (ArcA, EvgA, H-NS and 
RpoS) and gene/operon-specific transcription factors (GadX, GadW, AppY, YdeO, 
KdgR). These results demonstrated that RpoD acts as global regulator in the 
growth phase of E. coli and consequently improves acid tolerances.

Anaerobic expression of the gadE-mdtEF multidrug efflux operon is primarily 
regulated by the two-component system ArcBA through antagonizing the H-NS 
mediated repression.

The gadE-mdtEF operon encodes a central acid resistance regulator GadE and two 
multidrug efflux proteins MdtEF. Although transcriptional regulation of gadE in 
the context of acid resistance under the aerobic growth environment of 
Escherichia coli has been extensively studied, regulation of the operon under 
the physiologically relevant environment of anaerobic growth and its effect on 
the expression of the multidrug efflux proteins MdtEF in the operon has not been 
disclosed. Our previous study revealed that anaerobic induction of the operon 
was dependent on ArcA, the response regulator of the ArcBA two-component system, 
in the M9 glucose minimal medium. However, the detailed regulatory mechanism 
remains unknown. In this study, we showed that anaerobic activation of mdtEF was 
driven by the 798 bp unusually long gadE promoter. Deletion of evgA, ydeO, rpoS, 
and gadX which has been shown to activate the gadE expression during acid 
stresses under aerobic condition did not have a significant effect on the 
anaerobic activation of the operon. Rather, anaerobic activation of the operon 
was largely dependent on the global regulator ArcA and a GTPase MnmE. Under 
aerobic condition, transcription of gadE was repressed by the global DNA 
silencer H-NS in M9 minimal medium. Interestingly, under anaerobic condition, 
while ΔarcA almost completely abolished transcription of gadE-mdtEF, further 
deletion of hns in ΔarcA mutant restored the transcription of the full-length 
PgadE-lacZ, and P1- and P3-lacZ fusions, suggesting an antagonistic effect of 
ArcA on the H-NS mediated repression. Taken together, we conclude that the 
anaerobic activation of the gadE-mdtEF was primarily mediated by the 
two-component system ArcBA through antagonizing the H-NS mediated repression.

coli GadE acid resistance regulator.

College of Medicine, Mobile, AL 36688, USA.

Escherichia coli survives pH 2 environments through an acid resistance (AR) 
system regulated by the transcriptional activator GadE. Numerous proteins 
control gadE at an upstream, conserved, 798 bp intergenic region. We show this 
region produces three transcripts starting at -124 (T1), -324/-317 (T2) and -566 
(T3) bp from the gadE start codon. Transcriptional lacZ fusions to gadE promoter 
regions revealed P1 and P3 were active while P2 alone was not. However, pairing 
P3 with P2 activated P2 and increased expression 20-fold above P3 alone. The 
fusions were transferred to Salmonella, which lacks this AR system, and 
plasmid-borne E. coli-specific regulators EvgA, YdeO, GadE and GadX were 
introduced. Data revealed that YdeO and GadX activate P3, P2 and P3P2, while 
GadE autoactivates P1 and represses P3 and P3P2. The developing model indicates 
that different signals activate YdeO, GadX, or an MnmE-dependent regulator, 
which stimulate gadE transcription from the P3 and P2 promoters. Once made, GadE 
activates P1 and represses P3 and P2. The P1 region also enables efficient 
downstream transcription and translation of the P3 or P2 transcripts. Evidence 
indicates the entire 750 bp sensory integration locus is necessary for a 
versatile response.

N-acetyl-d-glucosamine induces the expression of multidrug exporter genes, 
mdtEF, via catabolite activation in Escherichia coli.

The expression of MdtEF, a multidrug exporter in Escherichia coli, is positively 
controlled through multiple signaling pathways, but little is known about 
signals that induce MdtEF expression. In this study, we investigated compounds 
that induce the expression of the mdtEF genes and found that out of 20 drug 
exporter genes in E. coli, the expression of mdtEF is greatly induced by 
N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc). The induction of mdtEF by GlcNAc is not 
mediated by the evgSA, ydeO, gadX, and rpoS signaling pathways that have been 
known to regulate mdtEF expression. On the other hand, deletion of the nagE 
gene, encoding the phosphotransferase (PTS) system for GlcNAc, prevented 
induction by GlcNAc. The induction of mdtEF by GlcNAc was also greatly inhibited 
by the addition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and completely abolished upon deletion of 
the cAMP receptor protein gene (crp). Other PTS sugars, glucose and 
d-glucosamine, also induced mdtEF gene expression. These results suggest that 
mdtEF expression is stimulated through catabolite control.

Antagonistic role of H-NS and GadX in the regulation of the glutamate 
decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance system in Escherichia coli.

Camerino, 62032 Camerino (MC), Italy.

One of the most efficient systems of acid resistance in Escherichia coli, the 
gad system, is based on the coordinated action of two isoforms of glutamate 
decarboxylase (GadA and GadB) and of a specific glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate 
antiporter (GadC). The gadA/BC genes, activated in response to acid stress and 
in stationary phase cells, are subjected to complex circuits of regulation 
involving sigma70, sigmaS, cAMP receptor protein, H-NS, EvgAS, TorRS, GadE, 
GadX, GadW, and YdeO. Herein, we provide evidence that the nucleoid-associated 
protein H-NS directly functions as repressor of gadA, one of the structural 
genes, and gadX, a regulatory gene encoding one of the primary activators of the 
gad system. Band shift and DNase I footprints reveal that H-NS indeed binds to 
specific sites in the promoter regions of gadA and gadX and represses the 
transcription of these genes both in an in vitro system and in vivo. Moreover, 
we show that a maltose-binding protein MalE-GadX fusion is able to stimulate the 
promoter activity of gadA/BC, thus indicating that GadX is by itself able to 
up-regulate the gad genes and that a functional competition between H-NS and 
GadX takes place at the gadA promoter. Altogether, our results indicate that 
H-NS directly inhibits gadA and gadX transcription and, by controlling the 
intracellular level of the activator GadX, indirectly affects the expression of 
the whole gad system.

School, 200 Longwood Ave., Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Overexpression of the response regulator EvgA confers an acid-resistant 
phenotype to exponentially growing Escherichia coli. This acid resistance is 
partially abolished by deletion of ydeP, yhiE or ydeO, genes induced by EvgA 
overexpression. Microarray analysis identified two classes of operons (genes). 
The first class contains seven operons induced by EvgA overexpression in the 
absence of ydeO, an AraC/XylS regulator gene. The second class contains 12 
operons induced by YdeO overexpression. Operons in the second class were induced 
by EvgA overexpression only in the presence of ydeO. EvgA is likely to directly 
upregulate operons in the first class, and indirectly upregulate operons in the 
second class via YdeO. Analysis using the motif-finding program alignace 
identified an 18 bp inverted repeat motif in six upstream regions of all seven 
operons directly regulated by EvgA. Gel mobility shift assays showed the 
specific binding of EvgA to the six sequences. Introduction of mutations into 
the inverted repeats upstream of ydeP and b1500-ydeO resulted in reduction in 
EvgA-induced ydeP and ydeO expression and acid resistance. These results suggest 
that EvgA binds to the inverted repeats and upregulates the downstream genes. 
Overexpression of YdeP, YdeO and YhiE conferred acid resistance to exponentially 
growing cells, whereas GadX overexpression did not. Microarray analysis also 
identified several GadX-activated genes. Several genes induced by overexpression 
of YdeO and GadX overlapped; however, yhiE was induced only by YdeO. The acid 
resistance induced by YdeO overexpression was abolished by deletion of yhiE, 
gadC, slp-yhiF, hdeA or hdeD, genes induced by YdeO overexpression, suggesting 
that several genes orchestrate YdeO-induced acid resistance. We propose a model 
of the regulatory network of the acid resistance genes.

Vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) is an economically important flavor 
compound that can be made in bacterial cell factories, but toxicity is a major 
problem for cells producing this aromatic aldehyde. Using (i) a global proteomic 
analysis supported by multiple physiological experiments, mutant analyses, and 
inferred transcription factor modeling and (ii) adaptive laboratory evolution 
(ALE) of vanillin tolerance combined with genome-wide analysis of the underlying 
mutations, mechanisms of vanillin toxicity in Escherichia coli have been 
elucidated. We identified 147 proteins that exhibited a significant change in 
abundance in response to vanillin, giving the first detailed insight into the 
cellular response to this aldehyde. Vanillin caused accumulation of reactive 
oxygen species invoking adaptations coordinated by a MarA, OxyR, and SoxS 
regulatory network and increased RpoS/DksA-dependent gene expression. 
Differential fumarase C upregulation was found to prevent oxidative damage to 
FumA and FumB during growth with vanillin. Surprisingly, vanillin-dependent 
reduction pf copper (II) to copper (I) led to upregulation of the copA gene and 
growth in the presence of vanillin was shown to be hypersensitive to inhibition 
by copper ions. AcrD and AaeAB were identified as potential vanillin efflux 
systems. Vanillin-tolerant strains isolated by ALE had distinct nonsynonymous 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in gltA that led to increased citrate 
synthase activity. Strain-specific mutations in cpdA, rob, and marC were also 
present. One strain had a large (∼10-kb) deletion that included the marRAB 
region. Our data provide new understanding of bacterial vanillin toxicity and 
identify novel gene targets for future engineering of vanillin-tolerant strains 
of E. coli IMPORTANCE A particular problem for the biotechnological production 
of many of the valuable chemicals that we are now able to manufacture in 
bacterial cells is that these products often poison the cells producing them. 
Solutions to improve product yields or alleviate such toxicity using the 
techniques of modern molecular biology first require a detailed understanding of 
the mechanisms of product toxicity. Here we have studied the economically 
important flavor compound vanillin, an aromatic aldehyde that exerts significant 
toxic effects on bacterial cells. We used high-resolution protein abundance 
analysis as a starting point to determine which proteins are upregulated and 
which are downregulated by growth with vanillin, followed by gene expression and 
mutant studies to understand the mechanism of the response. In a second 
approach, we evolved bacterial strains with higher vanillin tolerance. Their 
genome sequences have yielded novel insights into vanillin tolerance that are 
complementary to the proteomics data set.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of exogenous carbon monoxide-releasing 
molecules 2 (CORM-2) on the vitality and toxicity of E. coli ATCC 25922, and to 
analyze the potential mechanism.
METHODS: (1) In vitro experiments. Standard strains of E. coli ATCC 25922 were 
divided into groups A (without addition), B, C, D, and E according to the random 
number table, and then the latter 4 groups were respectively cultured with 1.2 
mmol/L CORM-2, 1.6 mmol/L CORM-2, 1.2 mmol/L inactive CORM-2 (iCORM-2), 1.6 
mmol/L iCORM-2, with six samples in each group. After being cultured for 0, 3, 
5, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 27, 30, 48 hours, proliferative vitality of E. coli 
was examined (denoted as absorption value under 600 nm wavelength), and bacteria 
number was counted. Other standard strains of E. coli ATCC 25922 were divided 
into groups F (without addition) and G (cultured with 0.8 mmol/L CORM-2), the 
expressions of genes fliA, dnaK, marA, and waaQ related to E. coli were detected 
by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. (2) In vivo experiments. Other standard 
strains of E. coli ATCC 25922 were grouped as A', B', C', D', and E' and treated 
with the same method as that in groups A, B, C, D, and E, and 0.5 mL bacterial 
liquid of each group were collected when the absorption value of bacterial 
liquid in group A' was equal to 0.4 (under 600 nm wavelength). Seventy-two 
C57BL/6 mice were divided into groups, namely blank control (without treatment), 
H, I, J, K, and L according to the random number table, with 12 mice in each 
group. The mice in the latter 5 groups were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 
mL bacterial suspension of groups A', B', C', D', and E' respectively. After 
injection, general condition of mice in groups H, I, J, K, and L was observed. 
The serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were determined at post injection hour (PIH) 
6, 12. The liver and lung samples were harvested for determination of 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity at PIH 12. The same process was carried out in 
blank control group. Data were processed with repeated measure analysis of 
variance (ANOVA), factorial design ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, and t test.
RESULTS: (1) In vitro experiments. Compared with those of groups A and D, the 
proliferative vitality and bacteria number of E. coli in group B were all 
decreased (with F values respectively 1170.80, 217.52, P values all below 0.01). 
Compared with those of groups A and E, the proliferative vitality and bacteria 
number of E. coli in group C were also obviously decreased (with F values 
respectively 7948.34, 14 432.85, P values all below 0.01). Compared with those 
in group F, the expression of fliA was downregulated, while the expressions of 
dnaK, marA, and waaQ were upregulated in group G (with t values 30.28, -165.54, 
-168.88, -187.28, P values all below 0.01). (2) In vivo experiments. Symptoms 
including listlessness and tachypnea were observed in mice in groups H, K, and 
L, and they were ameliorated or not obvious in groups I and J. At PIH 6, the 
serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in groups H and K were respectively (647.3 ± 3.8) 
pg/mL, (3.44 ± 0.22) ng/mL and (639.3 ± 0.8) pg/mL, (2.47 ± 0.32) ng/mL, which 
were obviously higher than those in group I [(124.6 ± 10.7) pg/mL, (1.03 ± 0.16) 
ng/mL, with t values from 15.22 to 84.03, P values all below 0.01]. The serum 
levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in group J at PIH 6, 12 were also obviously decreased 
as compared with those in groups H and L (with t values from 19.27 to 245.34, P 
values all below 0.01). MPO activity of liver and lung tissues were 
significantly attenuated in group I at PIH 12 as compared with those in groups H 
and K, and it was also attenuated in group J when compared with those in groups 
H and L (with t values respectively from 17.36 to 18.92 and 2.35 to 3.61, P 
values all below 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: CORM-2 can obviously inhibit the vitality and toxicity of E. coli, 
which might be attributable to regulation of expressions of genes fliA, dnaK, 
marA, and waaQ of E. coli.

Regulation of acrAB expression by cellular metabolites in Escherichia coli.

Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, 136

OBJECTIVES: Multidrug efflux pumps mediate resistance to antibiotics and other 
toxic compounds. We studied the role of AcrAB-TolC, the main efflux pump in 
Escherichia coli, in regulating gene expression.
METHODS: Deletion mutants, an acrABp-lacZ fusion and reverse 
transcription-real-time quantitative PCR experiments were used to study the role 
of AcrAB-TolC and metabolism in regulating gene expression of the acrAB operon 
and its transcriptional regulators.
RESULTS: Deletion of the acrB gene increased the expression of the acrAB operon. 
A similar induction of acrAB was found when acrA or tolC was deleted, and when 
the pump function was inhibited using phenylalanine-arginine-β-naphthylamide. 
The induction of acrAB in the ΔacrB strain was totally (AcrR or SoxS) or 
partially (SoxR or MarA) prevented when the genes for these acrAB regulators 
were also deleted. The expression of soxS and marA, but not of acrR, was 
increased in the ΔacrB strain, which also showed altered expression of many 
other genes related to different cellular processes, including motility. 
Deletion of the metabolic genes entA and entE (enterobactin biosysnthesis), glpX 
(gluconeogenesis), cysH (cysteine biosynthesis) and purA (purine biosynthesis) 
also prevented activation of the acrAB promoter in the ΔacrB strain. Addition of 
the enterobactin biosynthesis intermediate metabolite 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate 
induced the expression of acrAB.
CONCLUSIONS: These results together suggest a model in which the AcrAB-TolC pump 
effluxes cellular metabolites that are toxic and/or have a signalling role. If 
the pump is inactivated or inhibited, these metabolites would accumulate, 
inactivating AcrR and/or up-regulating soxS and marA expression, ultimately 
triggering the up-regulation of acrAB expression to restore homeostasis.

A competition mechanism regulates the translation of the Escherichia coli operon 
encoding ribosomal proteins L35 and L20.

Physico-Chimique, 13 rue Pierre et Marie Curie, 75005 Paris, France.

Escherichia coli ribosomal protein (r-protein) L20 is essential for the assembly 
of the 50S ribosomal subunit and is also a translational regulator of its own 
rpmI-rplT operon, encoding r-proteins L35 and L20 in that order. L20 directly 
represses the translation of the first cistron and, through translational 
coupling, that of its own gene. The translational operator of the operon is 450 
nt in length and includes a long-range pseudoknot interaction between two RNA 
sequences separated by 280 nt. L20 has the potential to bind both to this 
pseudoknot and to an irregular hairpin, although only one site is occupied at a 
time during regulation. This work shows that the rpmI-rplT operon is regulated 
by competition between L20 and the ribosome for binding to mRNA in vitro and in 
vivo. Detailed studies on the regulatory mechanisms of r-protein synthesis have 
only been performed on the rpsO gene, regulated by r-protein S15, and on the 
alpha operon, regulated by S4. Both are thought to be controlled by a trapping 
mechanism, whereby the 30S ribosomal subunit, the mRNA, and the initiator tRNA 
are blocked as a nonfunctional preternary complex. This alternative mode of 
regulation of the rpmI-rplT operon raises the possibility that control is 
kinetically and not thermodynamically limited in this case. We show that the 
pseudoknot, which is known to be essential for L20 binding and regulation, also 
enhances 30S binding to mRNA as if this structure is specifically recognised by 
the ribosome.

Ribosomal protein L20 controls expression of the Bacillus subtilis infC operon 
via a transcription attenuation mechanism.

Curie, 75005 Paris, France.

In contrast to Escherichia coli no molecular mechanism controlling the 
biosynthesis of ribosomal proteins has been elucidated in Gram-positive 
organisms. Here we show that the expression of the Bacillus subtilis 
infC-rpmI-rplT operon encoding translation factor IF3 and the ribosomal proteins 
L35 and L20 is autoregulated by a complex transcription attenuation mechanism. 
It implicates a 200-bp leader region upstream of infC which contains two 
conserved regulatory elements, one of which can act as a transcription 
terminator. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches we show that expression of the 
operon is regulated at the level of transcription elongation by a change in the 
structure of the leader mRNA which depends upon the presence of ribosomal 
protein L20. L20 binds to a phylogenetically conserved domain and provokes 
premature transcription termination at the leader terminator. Footprint and 
toeprint experiments support a regulatory model involving molecular mimicry 
between the L20-binding sites on 23S rRNA and the mRNA. Our data suggest that 
Nomura's model of ribosomal protein biosynthesis based on autogenous control and 
molecular mimicry is also valid in Gram-positive organisms.

Physiological effects of translation initiation factor IF3 and ribosomal protein 
L20 limitation in Escherichia coli.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine, University of 
California, Davis 95616, USA.

To investigate the physiological roles of translation initiation factor IF3 and 
ribosomal protein L20 in Escherichia coli, the infC, rpmI and rpIT genes 
encoding IF3, L35 and L20, respectively, were placed under the control of lac 
promotor/operator sequences. Thus, their expression is dependent upon the amount 
of inducer isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) in the medium. Lysogenic strains 
were constructed with recombinant lambda phages that express either rpmI and 
rplT or infC and prmI in trans, thereby allowing depletion of only IF3 or L20 at 
low IPTG concentrations. At low cellular concentration of IF3, but not L20, 
decreases and the growth rate slows. Furthermore, ribosomes run off polysomes, 
indicating that IF3 functions during the initiation phase of protein synthesis 
in vivo. During slow growth, the ratio of RNA to protein increases rather than 
decreases as occurs with control strains, indicating that IF3 limitation 
disrupts feedback inhibition of rRNA synthesis. As IF3 levels drop, expression 
from an AUU-infC-lacZ fusion increases, whereas expression decreases from an 
AUG-infC-lacZ fusion, thereby confirming the model of autogenous regulation of 
infC. The effects of L20 limitation are similar; cells grown in low 
concentrations of IPTG exhibited a decrease in the rate of growth, a decrease in 
cellular L20 concentration, no change in IF3 concentration, and a small increase 
in the ratio of RNA to protein. In addition, a decrease in 50S subunits and the 
appearance of an aberrant ribosome peak at approximately 41-43S is seen. 
Previous studies have shown that the L20 protein negatively controls its own 
gene expression. Reduction of the cellular concentration of L20 derepresses the 
expression of an rplT-lacZ gene fusion, thus confirming autogenous regulation by 
L20.

Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Buchnera aphidicola (endosymbiont of

A 4.5-kilobase DNA fragment from Buchnera aphidicola, the endosymbiont of the 
aphid Schizaphis graminum, was cloned and sequenced. On the basis of homology to 
Escherichia coli, the following genes were found in the order listed: 
aroH-thrS-infC-rpmI-rplT. AroH corresponds to the E. coli tryptophan-inhibited 
3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase. Evidence was 
presented indicating that this is the sole gene for DAHP synthase in the B. 
aphidicola genome. This enzyme initiates the complex branched pathway leading to 
aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The presence of aroH is consistent with past 
observations indicating that aphid endosymbionts are able to synthesize 
tryptophan for the aphid host. thrS, infC, rpmI, and rplT correspond to genes 
for threonine tRNA synthase, initiation factor-3, and large ribosome subunit 
proteins L35 and L20, respectively. Sequence comparisons indicate some 
differences and similarities between E. coli and B. aphidicola with respect to 
the possible regulation of synthesis of these proteins.

A specific 1542-bp DNA fragment was amplified from Mycoplasma fermentans 
(incognitus strain) using a unique 23-nucleotide (nt) synthetic 
deoxyribonucleotide (oligo) (5'-TCCAAAAAGTCCGGAATTTGGGG) as the primer pair in 
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 23-nt sequence is part of the 29-bp 
terminal inverted repeat (IR) which forms the left potential stem-and-loop (s&l) 
structure of the previously identified M. fermentans insertion-sequence(IS)-like 
genetic element [Hu et al., Gene 93 (1990) 67-72]. The amplified DNA was cloned 
and sequenced. A pair of 27-bp IR containing the 23-nt synthetic oligo was 
identified at both termini. Between the IR, there are four potential open 
reading frames (ORFs) which are arranged adjacent to each other in the order, 
ORF-1, ORF-2, ORF-3 and ORF-4, with parts of ORF-1 and ORF-2 overlapping. The 
deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of ORF-2, ORF-3 and ORF-4 are 34 to 60% 
identical to the translation initiation factor IF3 (encoded by the infC gene), 
ribosomal proteins L35 (rpmI gene) and L20 (rplT gene) of Escherichia coli and 
Bacillus stearothermophilus, respectively. In bacteria, the infC-rpmI-rplT genes 
are organized to function as an operon. There are multiple sites with 
promoter-like sequences identified upstream from the putative infC gene in the 
mycoplasma closely resembling the gene arrangement in the bacterial operon. All 
three genes of ORF-2, ORF-3 and ORF-4 are preceded individually by a strong 
appropriately spaced (7 and 10 bp) putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence 
(5'-AAGGA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The Escherichia coli infC-rpmI-rplT operon encodes translation initiation factor 
IF3 and the ribosomal proteins, L35 and L20, respectively. The expression of the 
last cistron (rplT) has been shown to be negatively regulated at a 
post-transcriptional level by its own product, L20, which acts at an internal 
operator located within infC. The present work shows that L20 directly represses 
the expression of rpmI, and indirectly that of rplT, via translational coupling 
with rpmI. Deletions and an inversion of the coding region of rpmI, suggest an 
mRNA secondary structure forming between sequences within rpmI and the 
translation initiation site of rplT. To verify the existence of this structure, 
detailed analyses were performed using chemical and enzymatic probes. Also, 
mutants that uncoupled rplT expression from that of rpmI, were isolated. The 
mutations fall at positions that would base-pair in the secondary structure. Our 
model is that L20 binds to its operator within infC and represses the 
translation of rpmI. When the rpmI mRNA is not translated, it can base-pair with 
the ribosomal binding site of rplT, sequestering it, and abolishing rplT 
expression. If the rpmI mRNA is translated, i.e. covered by ribosomes, the 
inhibitory structure cannot form leaving the translation initiation site of rplT 
free for ribosomal binding and for full expression. Although translational 
coupling in ribosomal protein operons has been suspected to be due to the 
formation of secondary structures that sequester internal ribosomal binding 
sites, this is the first time that such a structure has been shown to exist.

In vivo transcriptional pattern in the infC operon of Bacillus

By Northern blot and primer extension analyses it was shown that in Bacillus 
stearothermophilus the genes infC, rpmI and rplT constitute a single 
transcriptional unit; the promoter and the transcriptional start-point used in 
vivo were identified and the half-life of the transcript (1.2 min) was 
determined. No indication of multiple initiation sites nor of differential 
stability of different regions of the transcript was found. The results suggest 
that Escherichia coli and B. stearothermophilus have a different pattern of 
transcription around the infC gene cluster and that differential translational 
efficiency within the infC-rpmI-rplT transcriptional unit accounts for the 
different levels of IF3, L35 and L20 expression. The rare AUU initiation codon 
is the only strictly conserved element of the several peculiar transcriptional 
and translational features found in E. coli infC. Upon changing this codon to 
AUG, we found a ca. 30-fold increased expression of B. stearothermophilus infC, 
which is similar to that previously found with E. coli infC (i.e. 40-fold), and 
provided evidence that regulation of infC expression through its rare AUU 
initiation codon might be a general phenomenon in bacteria.

Translated translational operator in Escherichia coli. Auto-regulation in the 
infC-rpmI-rplT operon.

The genes coding for translation initiation factor IF3 (infC) and for the 
ribosomal proteins L35 (rpmI) and L20 (rplT) are transcribed in that order from 
a promoter in front of infC. The last two cistrons of the operon (rpmI and rplT) 
can be transcribed from a weak secondary promoter situated within the first 
cistron (infC). Previous experiments have shown that the expression of infC, the 
first cistron of the operon, is negatively autoregulated at the translational 
level and that the abnormal AUU initiation codon of infC is responsible for the 
control. We show that the expression of the last cistron (rplT) is also 
autoregulated at the posttranscriptional level. The L20 concentration regulates 
the level of rplT expression by acting in trans at a site located within the 
first cistron (infC) and thus different from that at which IF3 is known to act. 
This regulatory site, several hundred nucleotides upstream from the target gene 
(rplT), was identified through deletions, insertions and a point mutation. Thus, 
the expression of the operon is controlled in trans by the products of two 
different cistrons acting at two different sites. The localization within an 
open reading frame (infC) of a regulatory site acting in cis on the translation 
of a downstream gene (rplT) is new and was unforeseen since ribosomes 
translating through the regulatory site might be expected to impair either the 
binding of L20 or the mRNA secondary structure change caused by the binding. The 
possible competition between translation of the regions acting in cis and the 
regulation of the expression of the target gene is discussed.

Using two synthetic deoxyribonucleotide probes encoding segments of the primary 
structure of initiation factor IF3 from Bacillus stearothermophilus, we 
identified and cloned a segment of DNA which carries the infC gene. As in 
Escherichia coli, the infC gene begins with the unusual initiation triplet AUU, 
and is followed by the structural genes for ribosomal proteins L35 and L20 (rpmI 
and rplT, respectively).

Primary structures of and genes for new ribosomal proteins A and B in 
Escherichia coli.

Wada A, Sako T.

We determined the partial primary structures of and identified the genes for new 
basic proteins A and B in Escherichia coli ribosomal 50S subunits, found by 
means of an improved two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method. The sequence up 
to the 17th amino acid of protein B was in agreement with that of the X gene in 
the spc operon. The gene for protein A was searched for in the GenBank data base 
using the sequence up to the 35th amino acid, and was found at a locus between 
infC and rplT. The base sequence indicated that protein A contained 64 amino 
acids and had a molecular weight of 6,984. We conclude that proteins A and B are 
intrinsic ribosomal proteins, and propose calling their genes, rpmI and rpmJ, 
respectively.

A promoter is one of the most important and basic tools used to achieve diverse 
synthetic biology goals. Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used model 
organisms in synthetic biology to produce useful target products and establish 
complicated regulation networks. During the fine-tuning of metabolic or 
regulation networks, the limited number of well-characterized inducible 
promoters has made implementing complicated strategies difficult. In this study, 
104 native promoter-5'-UTR complexes (PUTR) from E. coli were screened and 
characterized based on a series of RNA-seq data. The strength of the 104 PUTRs 
varied from 0.007% to 4630% of that of the PBAD promoter in the transcriptional 
level and from 0.1% to 137% in the translational level. To further upregulate 
gene expression, a series of combinatorial PUTRs and cascade PUTRs were 
constructed by integrating strong transcriptional promoters with strong 
translational 5'-UTRs. Finally, two combinatorial PUTRs (PssrA-UTRrpsT and 
PdnaKJ-UTRrpsT) and two cascade PUTRs (PUTRssrA-PUTRinfC-rplT and 
PUTRalsRBACE-PUTRinfC-rplT) were identified as having the highest activity, with 
expression outputs of 170%, 137%, 409%, and 203% of that of the PBAD promoter, 
respectively. These engineered PUTRs are stable for the expression of different 
genes, such as the red fluorescence protein gene and the β-galactosidase gene. 
These results show that the PUTRs characterized and constructed in this study 
may be useful as a plug-and-play synthetic biology toolbox to achieve 
complicated metabolic engineering goals in fine-tuning metabolic networks to 
produce target products.

Ribosomal protein L20 controls expression of the Bacillus subtilis infC operon 
via a transcription attenuation mechanism.

Curie, 75005 Paris, France.

In contrast to Escherichia coli no molecular mechanism controlling the 
biosynthesis of ribosomal proteins has been elucidated in Gram-positive 
organisms. Here we show that the expression of the Bacillus subtilis 
infC-rpmI-rplT operon encoding translation factor IF3 and the ribosomal proteins 
L35 and L20 is autoregulated by a complex transcription attenuation mechanism. 
It implicates a 200-bp leader region upstream of infC which contains two 
conserved regulatory elements, one of which can act as a transcription 
terminator. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches we show that expression of the 
operon is regulated at the level of transcription elongation by a change in the 
structure of the leader mRNA which depends upon the presence of ribosomal 
protein L20. L20 binds to a phylogenetically conserved domain and provokes 
premature transcription termination at the leader terminator. Footprint and 
toeprint experiments support a regulatory model involving molecular mimicry 
between the L20-binding sites on 23S rRNA and the mRNA. Our data suggest that 
Nomura's model of ribosomal protein biosynthesis based on autogenous control and 
molecular mimicry is also valid in Gram-positive organisms.

Physiological effects of translation initiation factor IF3 and ribosomal protein 
L20 limitation in Escherichia coli.

California, Davis 95616, USA.

To investigate the physiological roles of translation initiation factor IF3 and 
ribosomal protein L20 in Escherichia coli, the infC, rpmI and rpIT genes 
encoding IF3, L35 and L20, respectively, were placed under the control of lac 
promotor/operator sequences. Thus, their expression is dependent upon the amount 
of inducer isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) in the medium. Lysogenic strains 
were constructed with recombinant lambda phages that express either rpmI and 
rplT or infC and prmI in trans, thereby allowing depletion of only IF3 or L20 at 
low IPTG concentrations. At low cellular concentration of IF3, but not L20, 
decreases and the growth rate slows. Furthermore, ribosomes run off polysomes, 
indicating that IF3 functions during the initiation phase of protein synthesis 
in vivo. During slow growth, the ratio of RNA to protein increases rather than 
decreases as occurs with control strains, indicating that IF3 limitation 
disrupts feedback inhibition of rRNA synthesis. As IF3 levels drop, expression 
from an AUU-infC-lacZ fusion increases, whereas expression decreases from an 
AUG-infC-lacZ fusion, thereby confirming the model of autogenous regulation of 
infC. The effects of L20 limitation are similar; cells grown in low 
concentrations of IPTG exhibited a decrease in the rate of growth, a decrease in 
cellular L20 concentration, no change in IF3 concentration, and a small increase 
in the ratio of RNA to protein. In addition, a decrease in 50S subunits and the 
appearance of an aberrant ribosome peak at approximately 41-43S is seen. 
Previous studies have shown that the L20 protein negatively controls its own 
gene expression. Reduction of the cellular concentration of L20 derepresses the 
expression of an rplT-lacZ gene fusion, thus confirming autogenous regulation by 
L20.

open reading frame (infC) of a regulatory site acting in cis on the translation 
of a downstream gene (rplT) is new and was unforeseen since ribosomes 
translating through the regulatory site might be expected to impair either the 
binding of L20 or the mRNA secondary structure change caused by the binding. The 
possible competition between translation of the regions acting in cis and the 
regulation of the expression of the target gene is discussed.

Using two synthetic deoxyribonucleotide probes encoding segments of the primary 
structure of initiation factor IF3 from Bacillus stearothermophilus, we 
identified and cloned a segment of DNA which carries the infC gene. As in 
Escherichia coli, the infC gene begins with the unusual initiation triplet AUU, 
and is followed by the structural genes for ribosomal proteins L35 and L20 (rpmI 
and rplT, respectively).

The genes coding for threonyl-tRNA synthetase (thrS), translation initiation 
factor 3 (infC) and ribosomal protein L20 (rplT) are clustered in the 
Escherichia coli genome. Previous studies had suggested the possibility that the 
expression of these genes is coupled. The transcriptional events in this operon 
have now been examined by S1 nuclease mapping and promoter fusion studies. The 
results indicate that infC-containing mRNAs are initiated from three separate 
promoters. Two of these are located in the protein-coding region of thrS and 
one, P12, is the major promoter at all growth rates tested. In addition, there 
is co-transcription of thrS and infC from the thrS promoter (PT). A single 
promoter for thrS has been mapped approx. 170 nucleotides upstream from its 
translation initiation site. Another promoter has been located within the 
infC-coding region. It is separated from the next downstream gene, rplT, by a 
transcription end point. However, termination at this region is only 50-70% 
efficient and transcripts starting at this promoter can read through into rplT. 
These findings demonstrate that the pattern of transcription in this operon is 
highly complex and the mRNA levels for each of the genes is determined by a 
variety of factors, including multiple promoters, co-transcription and 
readthrough of transcription termination signals.

Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Buchnera aphidicola (endosymbiont of

A 4.5-kilobase DNA fragment from Buchnera aphidicola, the endosymbiont of the 
aphid Schizaphis graminum, was cloned and sequenced. On the basis of homology to 
Escherichia coli, the following genes were found in the order listed: 
aroH-thrS-infC-rpmI-rplT. AroH corresponds to the E. coli tryptophan-inhibited 
3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase. Evidence was 
presented indicating that this is the sole gene for DAHP synthase in the B. 
aphidicola genome. This enzyme initiates the complex branched pathway leading to 
aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The presence of aroH is consistent with past 
observations indicating that aphid endosymbionts are able to synthesize 
tryptophan for the aphid host. thrS, infC, rpmI, and rplT correspond to genes 
for threonine tRNA synthase, initiation factor-3, and large ribosome subunit 
proteins L35 and L20, respectively. Sequence comparisons indicate some 
differences and similarities between E. coli and B. aphidicola with respect to 
the possible regulation of synthesis of these proteins.

Molecular analysis of the Erwinia chrysanthemi region containing the kdgA and

The pathways of pectin and galacturonate catabolism in Erwinia chrysanthemi 
converge to form a common intermediate, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, which is 
phosphorylated to form 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDGP) and then cleaved 
by the aldolase encoded by the kdgA gene. We cloned the kdgA gene of the E. 
chrysanthemi strain 3937 by complementing an Escherichia coli kdgA mutation, 
using an RP4-derivative plasmid. Restriction mapping of the kdgA region and 
isolation of kdgA-lac fusions allowed the more precise localization of the kdgA 
gene and determination of its transcriptional direction. The nucleotide sequence 
of the kdgA region indicated that the kdgA reading frame is 639 bases long, 
corresponding to a protein of 213 amino acids with a molecular mass of 22,187 
Da. Comparison of the deduced primary amino acid sequences of the E. 
chrysanthemi KDGP-aldolase to the E. coli, Zymomonas mobilis and Pseudomonas 
putida enzymes showed that they are highly conserved. The E. chrysanthemi kdgA 
structural gene begins 153 bases downstream of an open reading frame that has a 
high homology with the zwf E. coli gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase. The zwf gene is also linked to eda (kdgA) in E. coli and P. 
putida but genetic organization is different. Regulation of zwf and kdgA 
expression in E. chrysanthemi was analysed using lacZ fusions. The expression of 
zwf is independent of the growth rate, but is repressed in the presence of 
glucose. Induction of kdgA by pectin-degradation products is mediated in vivo by 
the negative regulatory gene kdgR, which also controls all the steps of pectin 
degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The root-colonizing bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens BL915 protects a variety 
of seedlings from damping-off disease caused by the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia 
solani. Spontaneous pleiotropic mutants of P. fluorescens strain BL915 which 
fail to synthesize antifungal factors such as chitinase, cyanide, and 
pyrrolnitrin and exhibit altered colony morphology were isolated. Such mutants 
fail to inhibit the growth of R. solani in vitro, and their biological control 
capability is sharply reduced. We characterized a genomic DNA fragment from 
strain BL915 which, when introduced into these pleiotropic mutants, restored the 
lost functions, the wild-type colony morphology, and bio-control activity. DNA 
sequence analysis of the genomic fragment revealed the presence of genes 
homologous to those of numerous bacterial global regulatory systems and 
identified a cluster of genes identical in organization to the Escherichia coli 
gene cluster consisting of uvrY, uvrC, pgsA, and glyW. Coordinate biosynthesis 
of multiple antifungal products in some heterologous Pseudomonas strains in 
response to the introduction of the strain BL915 genomic fragment confirmed the 
regulatory nature of sequences contained on this fragment. Further genetic 
analysis indicated a gene homologous to response regulators of bacterial 
two-component systems was sufficient to complement the pleiotropic mutants and 
to activate antifungal genes in heterologous strains. Marker exchange of a 
truncated version of this gene into the P. fluorescens BL915 chromosome 
generated pleiotropic mutants indistinguishable from the original spontaneous 
mutants. Cloning and sequencing of the response regulator gene from several 
spontaneous mutants allowed identification of various nucleotide changes 
associated with the gene in such mutants.

Global impact of sdiA amplification revealed by comprehensive gene expression 
profiling of Escherichia coli.

In Escherichia coli the amplification of sdiA, a positive activator of ftsQAZ, 
genes that are essential for septation, results in mitomycin C resistance. To 
help us understand this resistance phenotype, genes whose expression was altered 
by increased sdiA dosage were identified using a DNA microarray-based, 
comprehensive transcript profiling method. The expression of 62 genes was 
reduced by more than threefold; of these, 41 are involved in motility and 
chemotaxis. Moreover, the expression of 75 genes, 36 of which had been 
previously characterized, was elevated at least threefold. As expected, 
increased sdiA dosage led to significantly elevated sdiA and 'ddlB-ftsQAZ-lpxC 
operon expression. Transcription of two genes, uvrY and uvrC, located downstream 
of sdiA and oriented in the same direction, was elevated about 10-fold, although 
the intervening gene, yecF, of opposite polarity was unaffected by increased 
sdiA dosage. Three genes (mioC and gidAB) flanking the replication origin, oriC, 
were transcribed more often when sdiA dosage was high, as were 12 genes within 1 
min of a terminus of replication, terB. Transcription of the acrABDEF genes, 
mapping in three widely spaced loci, was elevated significantly, while several 
genes involved in DNA repair and replication (e.g., nei, recN, mioC, and mcrC) 
were moderately elevated in expression. Such global analysis provides a link 
between septation and the response to DNA-damaging agents.

Production of extracellular, plant cell wall degrading enzymes, the main 
virulence determinants of the plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. 
carotovora, is coordinately controlled by a complex regulatory network. 
Insertion mutants in the exp (extracellular enzyme production) loci exhibit 
pleiotropic defects in virulence and the growth-phase-dependent transcriptional 
activation of genes encoding extracellular enzymes. Two new exp mutations, 
designated expA and expS, were characterized. Introduction of the corresponding 
wild-type alleles to the mutants complemented both the lack of virulence and the 
impaired production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes. The expA gene was 
shown to encode a 24-kDa polypeptide that is structurally and functionally 
related to the uvrY gene product of Escherichia coli and the GacA response 
regulator of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Functional similarity of expA and uvrY was 
demonstrated by genetic complementation. The expA gene is organized in an operon 
together with a uvrC-like gene, identical to the organization of uvrY and uvrC 
in E. coli. The unlinked expS gene encodes a putative sensor kinase that shows 
92% identity to the recently described rpfA gene product from another E. 
carotovora subsp. carotovora strain. Our data suggest that ExpS and ExpA are 
members of two-component sensor kinase and response regulator families, 
respectively. These two proteins might interact in controlling virulence gene 
expression in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora.

Global control in Pseudomonas fluorescens mediating antibiotic synthesis and 
suppression of black root rot of tobacco.

Switzerland.

Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 colonizes plant roots, produces several secondary 
metabolites in stationary growth phase, and suppresses a number of plant 
diseases, including Thielaviopsis basicola-induced black root rot of tobacco. We 
discovered that mutations in a P. fluorescens gene named gacA (for global 
antibiotic and cyanide control) pleiotropically block the production of the 
secondary metabolites 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (Phl), HCN, and pyoluteorin. 
The gacA mutants of strain CHA0 have a drastically reduced ability to suppress 
black root rot under gnotobiotic conditions, supporting the previous 
observations that the antibiotic Phl and HCN individually contribute to the 
suppression of black root rot. The gacA gene is directly followed by a uvrC 
gene. Double gacA-uvrC mutations render P. fluorescens sensitive to UV 
irradiation. The gacA-uvrC cluster is homologous to the orf-2 (= uvrY)-uvrC 
operon of Escherichia coli. The gacA gene specifies a trans-active 24-kDa 
protein. Sequence data indicate that the GacA protein is a response regulator in 
the FixJ/DegU family of two-component regulatory systems. Expression of the gacA 
gene itself was increased in stationary phase. We propose that GacA, perhaps 
activated by conditions of restricted growth, functions as a global regulator of 
secondary metabolism in P. fluorescens.

Bacteria have to process several levels of gene regulation and coordination of 
interconnected regulatory networks to ensure the most adequate cellular response 
to specific growth conditions. Especially, expression of complex and costly 
fitness and pathogenicity-associated traits is coordinated and tightly regulated 
at multiple levels. We studied the interconnected regulation of the expression 
of the colibactin and yersiniabactin polyketide biosynthesis machineries, which 
are encoded by two pathogenicity islands found in many phylogroup B2 Escherichia 
coli isolates. Comparative phenotypic and genotypic analyses identified the 
BarA-UvrY two-component system as an important regulatory element involved in 
colibactin and yersiniabactin expression. The carbon storage regulator (Csr) 
system controls the expression of a wide range of central metabolic and 
virulence-associated traits. The availability of CsrA, the key translational 
regulator of the Csr system, depends on BarA-UvrY activity. We employed reporter 
gene fusions to demonstrate UvrY- and CsrA-dependent expression of the 
colibactin and yersiniabactin determinants and confirmed a direct interaction of 
CsrA with the 5' untranslated leader transcripts of representative genes of the 
colibactin and yersiniabactin operons by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift 
assays. This posttranscriptional regulation adds an additional level of 
complexity to control mechanisms of polyketide expression, which is also 
orchestrated at the level of ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-dependent regulation 
of transcription and phosphopantetheinyl transferase-dependent activation of 
polyketide biosynthesis. Our results emphasize the interconnection of iron- and 
primary metabolism-responsive regulation of colibactin and yersiniabactin 
expression by the fine-tuned action of different regulatory mechanisms in 
response to variable environmental signals as a prerequisite for bacterial 
adaptability, fitness, and pathogenicity in different habitats. IMPORTANCE 
Secondary metabolite expression is a widespread strategy among bacteria to 
improve their fitness in habitats where they constantly compete for resources 
with other bacteria. The production of secondary metabolites is associated with 
a metabolic and energetic burden. Colibactin and yersiniabactin are two 
polyketides, which are expressed in concert and promote the virulence of 
different enterobacterial pathogens. To maximize fitness, they should be 
expressed only in microenvironments in which they are required. Accordingly, 
precise regulation of colibactin and yersiniabactin expression is crucial. We 
show that the expression of these two polyketides is also interconnected via 
primary metabolism-responsive regulation at the posttranscriptional level by the 
CsrA RNA-binding protein. Our findings may help to optimize (over-)expression 
and further functional characterization of the polyketide colibactin. 
Additionally, this new aspect of concerted colibactin and yersiniabactin 
expression extends our knowledge of conditions that favor the expression of 
these virulence- and fitness-associated factors in different Enterobacterales 
members.

The Escherichia coli two-component signal sensor BarA binds protonated acetate 
via a conserved hydrophobic-binding pocket.

The BarA/UvrY two-component signal transduction system is widely conserved in 
γ-proteobacteria and provides a link between the metabolic state of the cells 
and the Csr posttranscriptional regulatory system. In Escherichia coli, the 
BarA/UvrY system responds to the presence of acetate and other short-chain 
carboxylic acids by activating transcription of the noncoding RNAs, CsrB and 
CsrC, which sequester the RNA-binding protein CsrA, a global regulator of gene 
expression. However, the state of the carboxyl group in the acetate molecule, 
which serves as the BarA stimulus, and the signal reception site of BarA remain 
unknown. In this study, we show that the deletion or replacement of the 
periplasmic domain of BarA and also the substitution of certain hydroxylated and 
hydrophobic amino acid residues in this region, result in a sensor kinase that 
remains unresponsive to its physiological stimulus, demonstrating that the 
periplasmic region of BarA constitutes a functional detector domain. Moreover, 
we provide evidence that the protonated state of acetate or formate serves as 
the physiological stimulus of BarA. In addition, modeling of the BarA sensor 
domain and prediction of the signal-binding site, by blind molecular docking, 
revealed a calcium channels and chemotaxis receptors domain with a conserved 
binding pocket, which comprised uncharged polar and hydrophobic amino acid 
residues. Based on the comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses, we 
propose that, at least, two types of BarA orthologues diverged and evolved 
separately to acquire distinct signal-binding properties, illustrating the wide 
adaptability of the bacterial sensor kinase proteins.

Regulatory loop between the CsrA system and NhaR, a high salt/high pH regulator.

Król JE(1).

Author information:

Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.

In E. coli, under high pH/high salt conditions, a major Na+/H+ antiporter (NhaA) 
is activated to maintain an internal pH level. Its expression is induced by a 
specific regulator NhaR, which is also responsible for osmC and pgaA regulation. 
Here I report that the NhaR regulator affects the carbon storage regulatory Csr 
system. I found that the expression of all major components of the Csr 
system-CsrA regulator, CsrB and CsrC small RNAs, and the CsrB and CsrC stability 
were indirectly affected by nhaR mutation under stress conditions. Using a 
combination of experimental and in silico analyses, I concluded that the 
mechanism of regulation included direct and indirect activation of a 
two-component system (TCS) response regulator-UvrY. NhaR regulation involved 
interactions with the regulators H-NS and SdiA and was affected by a naturally 
occurring spontaneous IS5 insertion in the promoter region. A regulatory circuit 
was proposed and discussed.

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the cAMP receptor protein (cAMP-CRP) and CsrA are the 
principal regulators of the catabolite repression and carbon storage global 
regulatory systems, respectively. cAMP-CRP controls the transcription of genes 
for carbohydrate metabolism and other processes in response to carbon 
nutritional status, while CsrA binds to diverse mRNAs and regulates translation, 
RNA stability, and/or transcription elongation. CsrA also binds to the 
regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) CsrB and CsrC, which antagonize its activity. The 
BarA-UvrY two-component signal transduction system (TCS) directly activates csrB 
and csrC (csrB/C) transcription, while CsrA does so indirectly. We show that 
cAMP-CRP inhibits csrB/C transcription without negatively regulating 
phosphorylated UvrY (P-UvrY) or CsrA levels. A crp deletion caused an elevation 
in CsrB/C levels in the stationary phase of growth and increased the expression 
of csrB-lacZ and csrC-lacZ transcriptional fusions, although modest stimulation 
of CsrB/C turnover by the crp deletion partially masked the former effects. 
DNase I footprinting and other studies demonstrated that cAMP-CRP bound 
specifically to three sites located upstream from the csrC promoter, two of 
which overlapped the P-UvrY binding site. These two proteins competed for 
binding at the overlapping sites. In vitro transcription-translation experiments 
confirmed direct repression of csrC-lacZ expression by cAMP-CRP. In contrast, 
cAMP-CRP effects on csrB transcription may be mediated indirectly, as it bound 
nonspecifically to csrB DNA. In the reciprocal direction, CsrA bound to crp mRNA 
with high affinity and specificity and yet exhibited only modest, conditional 
effects on expression. Our findings are incorporated into an emerging model for 
the response of Csr circuitry to carbon nutritional status.
IMPORTANCE: Csr (Rsm) noncoding small RNAs (sRNAs) CsrB and CsrC of Escherichia 
coli use molecular mimicry to sequester the RNA binding protein CsrA (RsmA) away 
from lower-affinity mRNA targets, thus eliciting major shifts in the bacterial 
lifestyle. CsrB/C transcription and turnover are activated by carbon metabolism 
products (e.g., formate and acetate) and by a preferred carbon source (glucose), 
respectively. We show that cAMP-CRP, a mediator of classical catabolite 
repression, inhibits csrC transcription by binding to the upstream region of 
this gene and also inhibits csrB transcription, apparently indirectly. We 
propose that glucose availability activates pathways for both synthesis and 
turnover of CsrB/C, thus shaping the dynamics of global signaling in response to 
the nutritional environment by poising CsrB/C sRNA levels for rapid response.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) biofilm formation enables the organism to 
avoid the host immune system, resist antibiotics, and provide a reservoir for 
persistent infection. Once the biofilm is established, eradication of the 
infection becomes difficult. Therefore, strategies against UPEC biofilm are 
urgently required. In this study, we investigated the effect of allicin, 
isolated from garlic essential oil, on UPEC CFT073 and J96 biofilm formation and 
dispersal, along with its effect on UPEC adhesion ability and swimming motility. 
Sub-inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of allicin decreased UPEC biofilm 
formation and affected its architecture. Allicin was also capable of dispersing 
biofilm. Furthermore, allicin decreased the bacterial adhesion ability and 
swimming motility, which are important for biofilm formation. Real-time 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that allicin decreased 
the expression of UPEC type 1 fimbriae adhesin gene fimH. Docking studies 
suggested that allicin was located within the binding pocket of heptyl 
α-d-mannopyrannoside in FimH and formed hydrogen bonds with Phe1 and Asn135. In 
addition, allicin decreased the expression of the two-component regulatory 
systems (TCSs) cognate response regulator gene uvrY and increased the expression 
of the RNA binding global regulatory protein gene csrA of UPEC CFT073, which is 
associated with UPEC biofilm. The findings suggest that sub-MICs of allicin are 
capable of affecting UPEC biofilm formation and dispersal, and decreasing UPEC 
adhesion ability and swimming motility.

The quorum sensing molecule Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is generated as a byproduct of 
activated methyl cycle by the action of LuxS in Escherichia coli. AI-2 is 
synthesized, released and later internalized in a cell-density dependent manner. 
Here, by mutational analysis of the genes, uvrY and csrA, we describe a 
regulatory circuit of accumulation and uptake of AI-2. We constructed a 
single-copy chromosomal luxS-lacZ fusion in a luxS + merodiploid strain and 
evaluated its relative expression in uvrY and csrA mutants. At the entry of 
stationary phase, the expression of the fusion and AI-2 accumulation was 
positively regulated by uvrY and negatively regulated by csrA respectively. A 
deletion of csrA altered message stability of the luxS transcript and CsrA 
protein exhibited weak binding to 5' luxS regulatory region. DNA protein 
interaction and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed direct 
interaction of UvrY with the luxS promoter. Additionally, reduced expression of 
the fusion in hfq deletion mutant suggested involvement of small RNA 
interactions in luxS regulation. In contrast, the expression of lsrA operon 
involved in AI-2 uptake, is negatively regulated by uvrY and positively by csrA 
in a cell-density dependent manner. The dual role of csrA in AI-2 synthesis and 
uptake suggested a regulatory crosstalk of cell signaling with carbon regulation 
in Escherichia coli. We found that the cAMP-CRP mediated catabolite repression 
of luxS expression was uvrY dependent. This study suggests that luxS expression 
is complex and regulated at the level of transcription and translation. The 
multifactorial regulation supports the notion that cell-cell communication 
requires interaction and integration of multiple metabolic signals.

The two-component signal transduction system BarA-UvrY of Escherichia coli and 
its orthologs globally regulate metabolism, motility, biofilm formation, stress 
resistance, virulence of pathogens and quorum sensing by activating the 
transcription of genes for regulatory sRNAs, e.g. CsrB and CsrC in E. coli. 
These sRNAs act by sequestering the RNA binding protein CsrA (RsmA) away from 
lower affinity mRNA targets. In this study, we used ChIP-exo to identify, at 
single nucleotide resolution, genomic sites for UvrY (SirA) binding in E. coli 
and Salmonella enterica. The csrB and csrC genes were the strongest targets of 
crosslinking, which required UvrY phosphorylation by the BarA sensor kinase. 
Crosslinking occurred at two sites, an inverted repeat sequence far upstream of 
the promoter and a site near the -35 sequence. DNAse I footprinting revealed 
specific binding of UvrY in vitro only to the upstream site, indicative of 
additional binding requirements and/or indirect binding to the downstream site. 
Additional genes, including cspA, encoding the cold-shock RNA-binding protein 
CspA, showed weaker crosslinking and modest or negligible regulation by UvrY. We 
conclude that the global effects of UvrY/SirA on gene expression are primarily 
mediated by activating csrB and csrC transcription. We also used in vivo 
crosslinking and other experimental approaches to reveal new features of 
csrB/csrC regulation by the DeaD and SrmB RNA helicases, IHF, ppGpp and DksA. 
Finally, the phylogenetic distribution of BarA-UvrY was analyzed and found to be 
uniquely characteristic of γ-Proteobacteria and strongly anti-correlated with 
fliW, which encodes a protein that binds to CsrA and antagonizes its activity in 
Bacillus subtilis. We propose that BarA-UvrY and orthologous TCS transcribe sRNA 
antagonists of CsrA throughout the γ-Proteobacteria, but rarely or never perform 
this function in other species.

The hybrid sensor kinase BarA and its cognate response regulator UvrY, members 
of the two-component signal transduction family, activate transcription of CsrB 
and CsrC noncoding RNAs. These two small RNAs act by sequestering the RNA 
binding protein CsrA, which posttranscriptionally regulates translation and/or 
stability of its target mRNAs. Here, we provide evidence that CsrA positively 
affects, although indirectly, uvrY expression, at both the transcriptional and 
translational levels. We also demonstrate that CsrA is required for properly 
switching BarA from its phosphatase to its kinase activity. Thus, the existence 
of a feedback loop mechanism that involves the Csr and BarA/UvrY global 
regulatory systems is exposed.

In Escherichia coli, activity of the global regulatory RNA binding protein CsrA 
is antagonized by two non-coding sRNAs, CsrB and CsrC, which sequester it away 
from its lower affinity mRNA targets. Transcription of csrB/C requires the 
BarA-UvrY two component signal transduction system, which responds to short 
chain carboxylates. We show that two DEAD-box RNA helicases, DeaD and SrmB, 
activate csrB/C expression by different pathways. DeaD facilitates uvrY 
translation by counteracting the inhibitory effect of long distance base-pairing 
between the uvrY mRNA leader and coding region, while SrmB does not affect UvrY 
or UvrY-phosphate levels. Contrary to the prevailing notion that these helicases 
act primarily at low temperatures, DeaD and SrmB activated csrB expression over 
a wide temperature range. High-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by 
cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) revealed in vivo interactions of 
DeaD with 39 mRNAs, including those of uvrY and 9 other regulatory genes. 
Studies on the expression of several of the identified genes revealed regulatory 
effects of DeaD in all cases and diverse temperature response patterns. Our 
findings uncover an expanded regulatory role for DeaD, which is mediated through 
novel mRNA targets, important global regulators and under physiological 
conditions that were considered to be incompatible with its function.

Urinary tract infections primarily caused by uropathogenic strains of 
Escherichia coli (E. coli) remain a significant public health problem in both 
developed and developing countries. An important virulence determinant in 
uropathogenesis is biofilm formation which requires expression of fimbriae, 
flagella, and other surface components such as lipopolysaccharides. In this 
study, we explored the regulation of uvrY and csrA genes in biofilm formation, 
motility and virulence determinants in uropathogenic E. coli. We found that 
mutation in uvrY suppressed biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces such as 
polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene and glass, and complementation of uvrY in the 
mutant restored the biofilm phenotype. We further evaluated the role of uvrY 
gene in expression of type 1 fimbriae, an important adhesin that facilitates 
adhesion to various abiotic surfaces. We found that phase variation of type 1 
fimbriae between fimbriated and afimbriated mode was modulated by uvrY at its 
transcriptional level. Deletion mutant of uvrY lowered expression of fimbrial 
recombinase genes, such as fimB, fimE, and fimA, a gene encoding major fimbrial 
subunit. Furthermore, transcription of virulence specific genes such as papA, 
hlyB and galU was also reduced in the deletion mutant. Swarming motility and 
expression of flhD and flhC was also diminished in the mutant. Taken together, 
our findings unravel a possible mechanism in which uvrY facilitates biofilm 
formation, persistence and virulence of uropathogenic E. coli.

Bacterial two-component system (TCS) is composed of the sensor kinase (SK) and 
the response regulator (RR). After monitoring an environmental signal or 
condition, SK activates RR through phosphorylation, ultimately leading to the 
signal-dependent regulation of genome transcription. In Escherichia coli, a 
total of more than 30 SK-RR pairs exist, each forming a cognate signal 
transduction system. Cross talk of the signal transduction takes place at three 
stages: signal recognition by SK (stage 1); RR phosphorylation by SK (stage 2); 
and target recognition by RR (stage 3). Previously, we analyzed the stage 2 
cross talk between the whole set of E. coli SK-RR pairs and found that the cross 
talk takes place for certain combinations. As an initial attempt to identify the 
stage 3 cross talk at the step of target promoter recognition by RR, we analyzed 
in this study the cross-recognition of target promoters by six NarL-family RRs, 
EvgA, NarL, NarP, RcsB, UhpA, and UvrY. Results of both in vivo and in vitro 
studies indicated that the stage 3 cross talk takes place for limited 
combinations, in particular, including a multifactor-regulated ydeP promoter.

BACKGROUND/AIM: One of the most studied bacterial resistance mechanisms is the 
resistance related to multidrug efflux pumps. In our study the pump activity of 
the Escherichia coli K-12 AG100 strain expressing the AcrAB-TolC pump system was 
investigated at pH 7 and pH 5 in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) 
promethazine (PMZ).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EPI activity was assessed by real-time fluorimetry. 
The influence of PMZ treatment on the relative expression of the pump genes 
acrA, acrB and their regulators marA, marB, marR, the stress genes soxS, rob, as 
well as the bacterial growth control genes ftsI, and sdiA were determined by 
RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: The EPI activity of PMZ was more effective at neutral pH. The PMZ 
treatment induced a significant stress response in the bacterium at acidic pH by 
the up-regulation of genes.
CONCLUSION: The genetic system that regulates the activity of the main efflux 
pump is pH-dependent.

The mechanisms responsible for the increase in ceftazidime MIC in two 
Escherichia coli in vitro selected mutants, Caz/20-1 and Caz/20-2, were studied. 
OmpF loss and overexpression of acrB, acrD and acrF that were associated with 
acrR and marR mutations and sdiA overexpression, together with mutations A233T 
and I332V in FtSI (PBP3) resulted in ceftazidime resistance in Caz/20-2, 
multiplying by 128-fold the ceftazidime MIC in the parental clinical isolate 
PS/20. Absence of detectable β-lactamase hydrolytic activity in the crude 
extract of Caz/20-2 was observed, and coincided with Q191K and P209S mutations 
in AmpC and a nucleotide substitution at -28 in the ampC promoter, whereas 
β-lactamase hydrolytic activity in crude extracts of PS/20 and Caz/20-1 strains 
was detected. Nevertheless, a fourfold increase in ceftazidime MIC in Caz/20-1 
compared with that in PS/20 was due to the increased transcript level of acrB 
derived from acrR mutation. The two Caz mutants and PS/20 showed the same 
mutations in AmpG and ParE.

OBJECTIVES: The role of sdiA in the acquisition of low-level multidrug 
resistance (MDR) was analysed and compared with that of marA and soxS in two 
Escherichia coli clinical isolates and two in vitro-selected mutants.
METHODS: The mutants were developed by growth in lomefloxacin and ceftazidime. 
The sdiA, marA, soxS, ftsI, tolC and acrB gene transcript levels were determined 
by RT-PCR. Analyses of 2,4-dinitrophenol susceptibility, the effect of an active 
efflux inhibitor on antibiotic and mitomycin C susceptibility, beta-lactamase 
hydrolytic activity, outer and inner membrane proteins and acrR gene sequencing 
were also performed.
RESULTS: Both mutants showed elevated marA and sdiA gene transcript levels, 
which were associated with increased susceptibility to 2,4-dinitrophenol; soxS 
overexpression was only seen in the mutant selected with ceftazidime. The two 
mutants showed MDR phenotypes in which ceftazidime, cefpirome and aztreonam MICs 
increased 4- to 128-fold, in addition to decreased susceptibility to quinolones, 
chloramphenicol and mitomycin C. The highest ceftazidime MIC in one of the 
mutants coincided with a frameshift mutation in acrR and the highest transcript 
level of ftsI (penicillin-binding protein 3), but not with a higher 
beta-lactamase activity. Likewise, active efflux associated with increased 
levels of acrB and tolC and decreased OmpF expression contributed to low-level 
MDR in both mutants.
CONCLUSIONS: marA and sdiA overexpression was a common feature of 
multidrug-resistant mutants selected by growth in lomefloxacin and ceftazidime. 
To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe in vitro selection with a 
fluoroquinolone or ceftazidime triggering sdiA overexpression in E. coli 
isolates.

In Escherichia coli the amplification of sdiA, a positive activator of ftsQAZ, 
genes that are essential for septation, results in mitomycin C resistance. To 
help us understand this resistance phenotype, genes whose expression was altered 
by increased sdiA dosage were identified using a DNA microarray-based, 
comprehensive transcript profiling method. The expression of 62 genes was 
reduced by more than threefold; of these, 41 are involved in motility and 
chemotaxis. Moreover, the expression of 75 genes, 36 of which had been 
previously characterized, was elevated at least threefold. As expected, 
increased sdiA dosage led to significantly elevated sdiA and 'ddlB-ftsQAZ-lpxC 
operon expression. Transcription of two genes, uvrY and uvrC, located downstream 
of sdiA and oriented in the same direction, was elevated about 10-fold, although 
the intervening gene, yecF, of opposite polarity was unaffected by increased 
sdiA dosage. Three genes (mioC and gidAB) flanking the replication origin, oriC, 
were transcribed more often when sdiA dosage was high, as were 12 genes within 1 
min of a terminus of replication, terB. Transcription of the acrABDEF genes, 
mapping in three widely spaced loci, was elevated significantly, while several 
genes involved in DNA repair and replication (e.g., nei, recN, mioC, and mcrC) 
were moderately elevated in expression. Such global analysis provides a link 
between septation and the response to DNA-damaging agents.

In Escherichia coli the amplification of sdiA, a positive activator of ftsQAZ, 
genes that are essential for septation, results in mitomycin C resistance. To 
help us understand this resistance phenotype, genes whose expression was altered 
by increased sdiA dosage were identified using a DNA microarray-based, 
comprehensive transcript profiling method. The expression of 62 genes was 
reduced by more than threefold; of these, 41 are involved in motility and 
chemotaxis. Moreover, the expression of 75 genes, 36 of which had been 
previously characterized, was elevated at least threefold. As expected, 
increased sdiA dosage led to significantly elevated sdiA and 'ddlB-ftsQAZ-lpxC 
operon expression. Transcription of two genes, uvrY and uvrC, located downstream 
of sdiA and oriented in the same direction, was elevated about 10-fold, although

The fitness cost of antibiotic resistance is a crucial factor to determine the 
evolutionary and transmission success of resistant bacteria. Exploring the 
fitness cost and compensation mechanism of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in 
bacteria may effectively reduce the transmission of drug-resistant genes in the 
environment. Engineered bacteria with the same genetic background that carry 
sulfonamide resistance gene were generated to explore the fitness cost of 
sulfonamide resistance gene in Escherichia coli. There were significant 
differences in the protein expression of the two-component system pathway (fliZ, 
fliA, fliC and lrhA), folate biosynthesis pathway (sul1, sul2 and sul3), ABC 
transporter system (ugpC, rbsA and gsiA), and outer membrane pore protein OmpD 
through the comparative analysis of differential proteins compared to sensitive 
bacteria. Thus, we could speculate the possible fitness compensation mechanism. 
Finally, quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the functions 
of some differential proteins at the transcriptional level. The fitness cost and 
compensatory evolution of antibiotic resistance are an essential part of 
bacterial evolution.

We describe here the functional characterization of the flgM gene in Yersinia 
pseudotuberculosis. Direct interaction of FlgM with the alternative sigma factor 
sigma(28) (FliA) was first confirmed. A conserved region in the C-terminus of 
FlgM was found which included the sigma(28) binding domain. By site-directed 
mutagenesis, bacterial two-hybrid analysis and Western blotting, the primary 
FlgM binding sites with sigma(28) were shown to be Ile85, Ala86 and Leu89. A 
role for FlgM in swimming motility was demonstrated by inactivation of flgM and 
subsequent complementation in trans. Transcriptional fusion analyses showed 
differential gene expression of flhDC, fliA, flgM and fliC in the fliA and flgM 
mutants compared with the wild-type. flhDC expression was not influenced by 
sigma(28) or FlgM while fliA expression was abolished in the fliA mutant and 
considerably reduced in the flgM mutant when compared to the wild-type, 
indicating that both FliA and FlgM can activate fliA transcription. Conversely, 
flgM transcription was higher in the fliA mutant when compared to the wild-type, 
suggesting that flgM transcription was repressed by sigma(28). Interestingly, 
fliC expression was markedly increased in the flgM mutant, suggesting a negative 
regulatory role for FlgM in fliC expression. The transcription of other 
sigma-dependent genes (cheW, flgD, flaA, csrA and fliZ) was also examined in 
fliA and flgM mutant backgrounds and this revealed that other sigma-factors 
apart from sigma(28) may be involved in flagellar biogenesis in Y. 
pseudotuberculosis. Taking together the motility phenotypes and effects of flgM 
mutation on the regulation of these key motility genes, we propose that the 
mechanisms regulating flagellar biogenesis in Y. pseudotuberculosis may differ 
from those described for other bacteria.

FlhDC is a heterohexameric complex that acts as a master regulator of flagellar 
biosynthesis genes in numerous bacteria. Previous studies have identified a 
single flhDC operon encoding this complex. However, we found that two flhDC loci 
are present throughout Paraburkholderia, and two additional flhC copies are also 
present in Paraburkholderia unamae. Systematic deletion analysis in P. unamae of 
the different flhDC copies showed that one of the operons, flhDC1, plays the 
predominant role, with deletion of its genes resulting in a severe inhibition of 
motility and biofilm formation. Expression analysis using promoter-lacZ fusions 
and real-time quantitative PCR support the primary role of flhDC1 in flagellar 
gene regulation, with flhDC2 a secondary contributor. Phylogenetic analysis 
shows the presence of the flhDC1 and flhDC2 operons throughout Paraburkholderia. 
In contrast, Burkholderia and other bacteria only carry the copy syntenous with 
flhDC2. The variations in impact each copy of flhDC has on downstream processes 
indicate that regulation of FlhDC in P. unamae, and likely other 
Paraburkholderia species, is regulated at least in part by the presence of 
multiple copies of these genes. IMPORTANCE Motility is important in the 
colonization of plant roots by beneficial and pathogenic bacteria, with flagella 
playing essential roles in host cell adhesion, entrance, and biofilm formation. 
Flagellar biosynthesis is energetically expensive. Its complex regulation by the 
FlhDC master regulator is well studied in peritrichous flagella expressing 
enterics. We report the unique presence throughout Paraburkholderia of multiple 
copies of flhDC. In P. unamae, the flhDC1 copy showed higher expression and a 
greater effect on swim motility, flagellar development, and regulation of 
downstream genes, than the flhDC2 copy that is syntenous to flhDC in Escherichia 
coli and pathogenic Burkholderia spp. The flhDC genes have evolved differently 
in these plant-growth-promoting bacteria, giving an additional layer of 
complexity in gene regulation by FlhDC.

Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 (O157) is a critical, 
foodborne, human intestinal pathogen that causes severe acute hemorrhagic 
diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and even death. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are noncoding 
regulatory molecules that sense environmental changes and trigger various 
virulence-related signaling pathways; however, few such sRNAs have been 
identified in O157. Here, we report a novel sRNA, EsrF that senses high ammonium 
concentrations in the colon and enhances O157 pathogenicity by promoting 
bacterial motility and adhesion to host cells. Specifically, EsrF was found to 
directly interact with the 5' untranslated regions of the flagellar biosynthetic 
gene, flhB, mRNA and increase its abundance, thereby upregulating expression of 
essential flagellar genes, including flhD, flhC, fliA, and fliC, leading to 
elevated O157 motility and virulence. Meanwhile, an infant rabbit model of O157 
infection showed that deletion of esrF and flhB significantly attenuates O157 
pathogenicity. Furthermore, NtrC-the response regulator of the NtrC/B 
two-component system-was found to exert direct, negative regulation of esrF 
expression. Meanwhile, high ammonium concentrations in the colon release the 
inhibitory effect of NtrC on esrF, thereby enhancing its expression and 
subsequently promoting bacterial colonization in the host colon. Our work 
reveals a novel, sRNA-centered, virulence-related signaling pathway in O157 that 
senses high ammonium concentrations. These findings provide novel insights for 
future research on O157 pathogenesis and targeted treatment 
strategies.IMPORTANCE The process by which bacteria sense environmental cues to 
regulate their virulence is complex. Several studies have focused on regulating 
the expression of the locus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island in the 
typical gut pathogenic bacterium, O157. However, few investigations have 
addressed the regulation of other virulence factors in response to intestinal 
signals. In this study, we report our discovery of a novel O157 sRNA, EsrF, and 
demonstrate that it contributed to bacterial motility and virulence in vitro and 
in vivo through the regulation of bacterial flagellar synthesis. Furthermore, we 
show that high ammonium concentrations in the colon induced esrF expression to 
promote bacterial virulence by releasing the repression of esrF by NtrC. This 
study highlights the importance of sRNA in regulating the motility and 
pathogenicity of O157.

Small RNAs OmrA and OmrB promote class III flagellar gene expression by 
inhibiting the synthesis of anti-Sigma factor FlgM.

Bacteria can move by a variety of mechanisms, the best understood being 
flagella-mediated motility. Flagellar genes are organized in a three-tiered 
cascade allowing for temporally regulated expression that involves both 
transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. The class I operon encodes the 
master regulator FlhDC that drives class II gene transcription. Class II genes 
include fliA and flgM, which encode the Sigma factor σ28, required for class III 
transcription, and the anti-Sigma factor FlgM, which inhibits σ28 activity, 
respectively. The flhDC mRNA is regulated by several small regulatory RNAs 
(sRNAs). Two of these, the sequence-related OmrA and OmrB RNAs, inhibit FlhD 
synthesis. Here, we report on a second layer of sRNA-mediated control downstream 
of FhlDC in the flagella pathway. By mutational analysis, we confirm that a 
predicted interaction between the conserved 5' seed sequences of OmrA/B and the 
early coding sequence in flgM mRNA reduces FlgM expression. Regulation is 
dependent on the global RNA-binding protein Hfq. In vitro experiments support a 
canonical mechanism: binding of OmrA/B prevents ribosome loading and decreases 
FlgM protein synthesis. Simultaneous inhibition of both FlhD and FlgM synthesis 
by OmrA/B complicated an assessment of how regulation of FlgM alone impacts 
class III gene transcription. Using a combinatorial mutation strategy, we were 
able to uncouple these two targets and demonstrate that OmrA/B-dependent 
inhibition of FlgM synthesis liberates σ28 to ultimately promote higher 
expression of the class III flagellin gene fliC.

Most Escherichia coli strains are innocuous to human beings; however, some 
strains can cause diarrhea and are grouped into pathotypes. Since current trends 
promote the use of natural-origin compounds to control bacteria, in this study, 
the effects of the phenolic compounds (PCs) tannic acid (TA), gallic acid (GA), 
methyl gallate (MG), and epigallocatechin gallate (EG) on the growth, swarming 
motility, biofilm formation, and expression of selected virulence genes of three 
E. coli pathotypes (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [EPEC], enterohemorrhagic 
Escherichia coli [EHEC], and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [ETEC]) were 
evaluated. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined by using 
microtiter plates, and the effects of sublethal PC concentrations on swarming 
motility were evaluated on Luria-Bertani agar. Biofilm formation was assessed in 
microtiter plates via crystal violet staining, and the expression levels of 
genes involved in biofilm formation (flhC, fliA, fliC, and csgA) and swarming 
motility (csgD and cyaA) were evaluated via quantitative PCR. All PC were 
bactericidal with minimal bactericidal concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 
2.1 mg/mL. At concentrations lower than the MBC, PCs decreased swarming motility 
(14.8-100%). GA reduced biofilm formation in all of the tested strains; however, 
TA, MG, and EG induced biofilm formation in some strains at specific 
concentrations. TA induced the overexpression of csgA, csgD, and cyaA, whereas 
the other PCs did not have any effects or reduced their expression levels. The 
PCs tested in this study showed potential to control E. coli strains belonging 
to the EHEC, ETEC, and EPEC pathotypes by affecting their growth, swarming 
motility, and virulence gene expression; however, proper concentrations must be 
used to avoid the induction of undesirable virulence factor genes.

Bacteriophages are genetic elements that play key roles in the evolution and 
diversification of bacterial genomes. The Shiga toxin (Stx)-encoding phage plays 
an important role in the horizontal transfer of the stx gene. However, the 
influence of the Stx phage integration on the physiological properties and gene 
expression pattern of the host have not been clearly resolved. In this study, we 
constructed the Sp5 lysogen through lysogenisation of E. coli K-12 by Sp5, an 
Stx2 phage in enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 Sakai, and examined the 
effect of the resulting lysogen on cell motility under various growth 
conditions. Sp5 lysogenisation decreased cell motility and the expression of 
fliC, which encodes flagellin, under anaerobic conditions at 37°C. Sp5 also 
lowered the expression of fliA, which encodes the FliA-sigma factor responsible 
for the transcription of fliC, and flhD, which facilitates the expression of 
fliA. Sp5 lysogenisation reduced the amount of FlhD and FlhC expressed from the 
araBAD promoter, suggesting that one or more genes present in Sp5 represses 
flhDC at the post-transcriptional level. Flagellin is highly antigenic and 
triggers an immune response in the host. Thus, Sp5 might enhance its viability 
by repressing the expression of the flagellar regulon to circumvent the immune 
response of host cells.

Non-O157 Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STECs) have become a growing 
concern to the food industry. Grape seed extract (GSE), a byproduct of wine 
industry, is abundant in polyphenols that are known to be beneficial to health. 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of GSE on the growth, 
quorum sensing, and virulence factors of Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) "top-six" non-O157 STECs. Minimal inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) of GSE was 2mg/ml against E. coli O26:H11, and 4mg/ml against the other 
non-O157 STECs tested. Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was the same as 
MIC for all six non-O157 STECs tested. At 5×10(5)CFU/ml inoculation level, 
4mg/ml GSE effectively inhibited the growth of all tested strains, while 
0.25-2mg/ml GSE delayed bacterial growth. At a higher inoculation level 
(1×10(7)CFU/ml), GSE had less efficacy against the growth of the selected six 
non-O157 STECs. Its impact on bacterial virulence was then assessed at this 
inoculation level. Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a universal signal molecule mediating 
quorum sensing (QS). GSE at concentration as low as 0.5mg/ml dramatically 
reduced AI-2 production of all non-O157 STECs tested, with the inhibitory effect 
proportional to GSE levels. Consistent with diminished QS, GSE at concentration 
of 0.125mg/ml caused marked reduction of swimming motility of all motile 
non-O157 STECs tested. In agreement, GSE treatment reduced the production of 
flagella protein FliC and its regulator FliA in E. coli O103:H2 and E. coli 
O111:H2. Furthermore, 4mg/ml GSE inhibited the production of Shiga toxin, a 
major virulence factor, in E. coli O103:H2 and E. coli O111:H2. In summary, GSE 
inhibits the growth of "top-six" non-O157 STECs at the population level relevant 
to food contamination. At higher initial population, GSE suppresses QS with 
concomitant decrease in motility, flagella protein expression and Shiga toxin 
production. Thus, GSE has the potential to be used in food industry to control 
non-O157 STEC.

Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is a major cause of zoonotic 
food- and water-borne intestinal infections worldwide with clinical consequences 
ranging from mild diarrhoea to hemolytic uraemic syndrome. The genome of EHEC 
O157:H7 contains many regions of unique DNA that are referred to as O islands 
including the Shiga toxin prophages and pathogenicity islands encoding key 
virulence factors. However many of these O islands are of unknown function. In 
this study, genetic analysis was conducted on OI-172 which is a 44,434 bp 
genomic island with 27 open reading frames. Comparative genome analysis showed 
that O1-72 is a composite island with progressive gain of genes since O157:H7 
evolved from its ancestral O55:H7. A partial OI-172 island was also found in 2 
unrelated E. coli strains and 2 Salmonella strains. OI-172 encodes several 
putative helicases, one of which (Z5898) is a putative DEAH box RNA helicase. To 
investigate the function of Z5898, a deletion mutant (EDL933ΔZ5898) was 
constructed in the O157:H7 strain EDL933. Comparative proteomic analysis of the 
mutant with the wild-type EDL933 found that flagellin was down-regulated in the 
Z5898 mutant. Motility assay showed that EDL933ΔZ5898 migrated slower than the 
wild-type EDL933 and electron microscopy found no surface flagella. Quantitative 
reverse transcription PCR revealed that the fliC expression of EDL933ΔZ5898 was 
significantly lower while the expression of its upstream regulator gene, fliA, 
was not affected. Using a fliA and a fliC promoter - green fluorescent protein 
fusion contruct, Z5898 was found to affect only the fliC promoter activity. 
Therefore, Z5898 regulates the flagella based motility by exerting its effect on 
fliC. We conclude that OI-172 is a motility associated O island and hereby name 
it the MAO island.

uropathogenic Escherichia coli.

School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

YdiV, a degenerate EAL domain protein, represses motility by interacting with 
FlhD to abolish FlhDC interaction with DNA. Here, we demonstrate that deletion 
of ydiV dysregulates coordinate control of motility and adherence by increasing 
adherence of Escherichia coli CFT073 to a bladder epithelial cell line by 
specifically increasing production of P fimbriae. Interestingly, only one of the 
two P fimbrial operons, pap_2, present in the genome of E. coli CFT073 was 
upregulated. This derepression of the pap_2 operon is abolished following 
deletion of either cya or crp, demonstrating cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent 
activation of the P fimbrial operon. However, the absence of YdiV does not 
affect the gene expression of cya and crp, and loss of SdiA in the ydiV mutant 
does not affect the derepression of the pap_2 operon, suggesting that YdiV 
control of adherence acts in response to cAMP levels. Deletion of ydiV increases 
motility by increasing expression of fliA, suggesting that in E. coli CFT073, 
YdiV regulates motility by the same mechanism as that described previously for 
commensal E. coli strains. Furthermore, analysis of site-directed mutations 
found two putative Mg(2+)-binding residues of four conserved YdiV residues (E29 
and Q219) that were involved in regulation of motility and FliC production, 
while two conserved c-di-GMP-binding residues (D156 and D165) only affected 
motility. None of the four conserved YdiV residues appeared to affect regulation 
of adherence. Therefore, we propose a model in which a degenerate EAL, YdiV, 
utilizes different domains to regulate motility through interaction with FlhD 
and adherence to epithelial cells through cAMP-dependent effects on the pap_2 
promoter.

Role of polyadenylation in regulation of the flagella cascade and motility in 
Escherichia coli.

Polyadenylation is recognized as part of a surveillance machinery for 
eliminating defective RNA molecules in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Escherichia 
coli strains, deficient in poly(A)polymerase I (PAP I), expressed less flagellin 
compared to wild-type strains. Because flagellin synthesis is a late step in the 
flagellar biosynthesis pathway, we assessed the role of PAP I in this cascade 
and in flagella function. Transcription of flhDC, fliA, and fliC was decreased 
in the PAP I mutant. These results provide evidence that polyadenylation 
positively controls the expression of genes belonging to the flagellar 
biosynthesis pathway and that this effect is mediated through the FlhDC master 
regulator. However, the downshift in flagella gene expression in the mutant 
strain did not provoke any noticeable defects in the synthesis of flagella, in 
biofilm formation and in swimming speed although there was a reduction in 
motility on soft agar. Our data support an alternative hypothesis that the 
reduced motility of the mutant resulted from an alteration of the cell membrane 
composition caused in part by the higher level of GlmS (Glucosamine-6P synthase) 
which accumulates in the mutant. In agreement with this hypothesis the mutant is 
more sensitive to hydrophobic agents and antibiotics and in particular to 
vancomycin. We propose that PAP I participates in the ability of the bacteria to 
adapt to and survive detrimental conditions by constantly monitoring and 
adjusting to its environment.

Metabolically-engineered Escherichia coli strains were developed by cloning 
poly-gamma-glutamic acid (gamma-PGA) biosynthesis genes, consisting of pgsB, 
pgsC and pgsA, from Bacillus subtilis The metabolic and regulatory pathways of 
gamma-PGA biosynthesis in E. coli were analyzed by DNA microarray. The inducible 
trc promoter and a constitutive promoter (P(HCE)) derived from the D-amino acid 
aminotransferase (D-AAT) gene of Geobacillus toebii were employed. The 
constitutive HCE promoter was more efficient than inducible trc promoter for the 
expression of gamma-PGA biosynthesis genes. DNA microarray analysis showed that 
the expression levels of several NtrC family genes, glnA, glnK, glnG, yhdX, 
yhdY, yhdZ, amtB, nac, argT and cbl were up-regulated and sucA, B, C, D genes 
were down-regulated. When (NH(4))(2)SO(4 )was added at 40 g/l into the feeding 
solution, the final gamma-PGA concentration reached 3.7 g/l in the fed-batch 
culture of recombinant E. coli/pCOpgs.

    Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Dec 19;97(26):14044-5.

Nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) of enteric bacteria activates transcription 
of genes/operons whose products minimize the slowing of growth under 
nitrogen-limiting conditions. To reveal the NtrC regulon of Escherichia coli we 
compared mRNA levels in a mutant strain that overexpresses NtrC-activated genes 
[glnL(Up)] to those in a strain with an ntrC (glnG) null allele by using DNA 
microarrays. Both strains could be grown under conditions of nitrogen excess. 
Thus, we could avoid differences in gene expression caused by slow growth or 
nitrogen limitation per se. Rearranging the spot images from microarrays in 
genome order allowed us to detect all of the operons known to be under NtrC 
control and facilitated detection of a number of new ones. Many of these operons 
encode transport systems for nitrogen-containing compounds, including compounds 
recycled during cell-wall synthesis, and hence scavenging appears to be a 
primary response to nitrogen limitation. In all, approximately 2% of the E. coli 
genome appears to be under NtrC control, although transcription of some operons 
depends on the nitrogen assimilation control protein, which serves as an adapter 
between NtrC and final sigma(70)-dependent promoters.

BACKGROUND: Enteric Escherichia coli survives the highly acidic environment of 
the stomach through multiple acid resistance (AR) mechanisms. The most effective 
system, AR2, decarboxylates externally-derived glutamate to remove cytoplasmic 
protons and excrete GABA. The first described system, AR1, does not require an 
external amino acid. Its mechanism has not been determined. The regulation of 
the multiple AR systems and their coordination with broader cellular metabolism 
has not been fully explored.
RESULTS: We utilized a combination of ChIP-Seq and gene expression analysis to 
experimentally map the regulatory interactions of four TFs: nac, ntrC, ompR, and 
csiR. Our data identified all previously in vivo confirmed direct interactions 
and revealed several others previously inferred from gene expression data. Our 
data demonstrate that nac and csiR directly modulate AR, and leads to a 
regulatory network model in which all four TFs participate in coordinating acid 
resistance, glutamate metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism. This model predicts a 
novel mechanism for AR1 by which the decarboxylation enzymes of AR2 are used 
with internally derived glutamate. This hypothesis makes several testable 
predictions that we confirmed experimentally.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the regulatory network underlying AR is 
complex and deeply interconnected with the regulation of GABA and glutamate 
metabolism, nitrogen metabolism. These connections underlie and experimentally 
validated model of AR1 in which the decarboxylation enzymes of AR2 are used with 
internally derived glutamate.

Multiple stress signal integration in the regulation of the complex sigma

The csiD-ygaF-gabDTP region in the Escherichia coli genome represents a cluster 
of sigma S-controlled genes. Here, we investigated promoter structures, sigma 
factor dependencies, potential co-regulation and environmental regulatory 
patterns for all of these genes. We find that this region constitutes a complex 
operon with expression being controlled by three differentially regulated 
promoters: (i) csiDp, which affects the expression of all five genes, is 
cAMP-CRP/sigma S-dependent and activated exclusively upon carbon starvation and 
stationary phase; (ii) gabDp1, which is sigma S-dependent and exhibits multiple 
stress induction like sigma S itself; and (iii) gabDp2[previously suggested by 
Schneider, B.L., Ruback, S., Kiupakis, A.K., Kasbarian, H., Pybus, C., and 
Reitzer, L. (2002) J. Bacteriol. 184: 6976-6986], which appears to be Nac/sigma 
70-controlled and to respond to poor nitrogen sources. In addition, we identify 
a novel repressor, CsiR, which modulates csiDp activity in a temporal manner 
during early stationary phase. Finally, we propose a physiological role for 
sigma S-controlled GabT/D-mediated gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) catabolism and 
glutamate accumulation in general stress adaptation. This physiological role is 
reflected by the activation of the operon-internal gabDp1 promoter under the 
different conditions that also induce sigma S, which include shifts to acidic pH 
or high osmolarity as well as starvation or stationary phase.

Sensitivity to formaldehyde requires a cysteine (Cys(35) in FrmR) conserved in 
all DUF156 proteins. A crystal structure of metal- and formaldehyde-sensing 
FrmR(E64H) reveals that an FrmR-specific amino-terminal Pro(2) is proximal to 
Cys(35), and these residues form the deduced formaldehyde-sensing site. Evidence 
is presented that implies that residues spatially close to the conserved 
cysteine tune the sensitivities of DUF156 proteins above or below critical 
thresholds for different effectors, generating the semblance of specificity 
within cells. Relative to FrmR, RcnR is less responsive to formaldehyde in 
vitro, and RcnR does not sense formaldehyde in vivo, but reciprocal mutations 
FrmR(P2S) and RcnR(S2P), respectively, impair and enhance formaldehyde 
reactivity in vitro Formaldehyde detoxification by FrmA requires 
S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione, yet glutathione inhibits formaldehyde detection by 
FrmR in vivo and in vitro Quantifying the number of FrmR molecules per cell and 
modeling formaldehyde modification as a function of [formaldehyde] demonstrates 
that FrmR reactivity is optimized such that FrmR is modified and frmRA is 
derepressed at lower [formaldehyde] than required to generate 
S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione. Expression of FrmA is thereby coordinated with the 
accumulation of its substrate.

Ni(II) Sensing by RcnR Does Not Require an FrmR-Like Intersubunit Linkage.

Huang HT, Maroney MJ.

E. coli RcnR (resistance to cobalt and nickel regulator) is a homotetrameric DNA 
binding protein that regulates the expression of a Ni(II) and Co(II) exporter 
(RcnAB) by derepressing expression of rcnA and rcnB in response to binding 
Co(II) or Ni(II). Prior studies have shown that the cognate metal ions, Ni(II) 
and Co(II), bind in six-coordinate sites at subunit interfaces and are 
distinguished from noncognate metals (Cu(I), Cu(II), and Zn(II)) by coordination 
number and ligand selection. In analogy with FrmR, a formaldehyde-responsive 
transcriptional regulator in the RcnR/CsoR family, the interfacial site allows 
the metal ions to "cross-link" the N-terminal domain of one subunit with the 
invariant Cys35 residue in another, which has been deemed to be key to mediating 
the allosteric response of the tetrameric protein to metal binding. Through the 
use of mutagenesis to disconnect one subunit from the metal-mediated cross-link, 
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as a structural probe, LacZ reporter assays, 
and metal binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the work 
presented here shows that neither the interfacial binding site nor the 
coordination number of Ni(II) is important to the allosteric response to binding 
of this cognate metal ion. The opposite is found for the other cognate metal 
ion, Co(II), with respect to the interfacial binding site, suggesting that the 
molecular mechanisms for transcriptional regulation by the two ions are 
distinct. The metal binding studies reveal that tight metal binding is 
maintained in the variant. XAS is further used to demonstrate that His33 is not 
a ligand for Co(II), Ni(II), or Zn(II) in WT-RcnR. The results are discussed in 
the context of the overall understanding of the molecular mechanisms of 
metallosensors.

FrmR from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (a CsoR/RcnR-like 
transcriptional de-repressor) is shown to repress the frmRA operator-promoter, 
and repression is alleviated by formaldehyde but not manganese, iron, cobalt, 
nickel, copper, or Zn(II) within cells. In contrast, repression by a mutant 
FrmRE64H (which gains an RcnR metal ligand) is alleviated by cobalt and Zn(II). 
Unexpectedly, FrmR was found to already bind Co(II), Zn(II), and Cu(I), and 
moreover metals, as well as formaldehyde, trigger an allosteric response that 
weakens DNA affinity. However, the sensory metal sites of the cells' endogenous 
metal sensors (RcnR, ZntR, Zur, and CueR) are all tighter than FrmR for their 
cognate metals. Furthermore, the endogenous metal sensors are shown to 
out-compete FrmR. The metal-sensing FrmRE64H mutant has tighter metal affinities 
than FrmR by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Gain of cobalt sensing by 
FrmRE64H remains enigmatic because the cobalt affinity of FrmRE64H is 
substantially weaker than that of the endogenous cobalt sensor. Cobalt sensing 
requires glutathione, which may assist cobalt access, conferring a kinetic 
advantage. For Zn(II), the metal affinity of FrmRE64H approaches the metal 
affinities of cognate Zn(II) sensors. Counter-intuitively, the allosteric 
coupling free energy for Zn(II) is smaller in metal-sensing FrmRE64H compared 
with nonsensing FrmR. By determining the copies of FrmR and FrmRE64H tetramers 
per cell, then estimating promoter occupancy as a function of intracellular 
Zn(II) concentration, we show how a modest tightening of Zn(II) affinity, plus 
weakened DNA affinity of the apoprotein, conspires to make the relative 
properties of FrmRE64H (compared with ZntR and Zur) sufficient to sense Zn(II) 
inside cells.

Escherichia coli and many other bacterial species can enter into a viable but

exposed to adverse environmental conditions. Pyruvate is known to be one factor 
that promotes resuscitation of VBNC cells. Here we studied the role of a 
pyruvate-sensing network, composed of the histidine kinase-response regulator 
systems BtsS/BtsR and YpdA/YpdB and the target gene btsT, encoding the 
high-affinity pyruvate/H+ symporter BtsT, in the resuscitation of VBNC E. coli 
K-12 cells after exposure to cold for 120 days. Analysis of the proteome of VBNC 
cells revealed upregulation, relative to exponentially growing cells, of BtsT 
and other proteins involved in pyruvate metabolism. Provision of pyruvate 
stimulated protein and DNA biosynthesis, and thus resuscitation, in wild-type 
but not btsSR ypdAB mutant VBNC cells. This result was corroborated by 
time-dependent tracking of the resuscitation of individual VBNC E. coli cells 
observed in a microfluidic system. Finally, transport assays revealed that 
14C-labeled pyruvate was rapidly taken up into VBNC cells by BtsT. These results 
provide the first evidence that pyruvate is taken up as a carbon source for the 
resuscitation of VBNC E. coli cells.IMPORTANCE Viable but nonculturable (VBNC) 
bacteria do not form colonies in standard medium but otherwise retain their 
metabolic activity and can express toxic proteins. Many bacterial genera, 
including Escherichia, Vibrio, and Listeria, have been shown to enter the VBNC 
state upon exposure to adverse conditions, such as low temperature, radiation, 
and starvation. Ultimately, these organisms pose a public health risk with 
potential implications for the pharmaceutical and food industries, as dormant 
organisms are especially difficult to selectively eliminate and VBNC bacteria 
can be resuscitated if placed in an environment with appropriate nutrition and 
temperature. Here we used a microfluidic system to monitor the resuscitation of 
single VBNC cells over time. We provide new molecular insights into the 
initiation of resuscitation by demonstrating that VBNC E. coli cells rapidly 
take up pyruvate with an inducible high-affinity transporter, whose expression 
is triggered by the BtsSR-YpdAB sensing network.

Two-component systems (TCSs) dictate many bacterial responses to environmental 
change via the activation of a membrane-embedded sensor kinase, which has 
molecular specificity for a cognate response regulator protein. However, 
although the majority of TCSs operate through seemingly strict cognate 
protein-protein interactions, there have been several reports of TCSs that 
violate this classical model of signal transduction. Our group has recently 
demonstrated that some of these cross-interacting TCSs function in a manner that 
imparts a fitness advantage to bacterial pathogens. In this study, we describe 
interconnectivity between the metabolite-sensing TCSs YpdA/YpdB and BtsS/BtsR in 
uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The YpdA/YpdB and BtsS/BtsR TCSs have 
been previously reported to interact in K12 E. coli, where they alter the 
expression of putative transporter genes yhjX and yjiY, respectively. These 
target genes are both upregulated in UPEC during acute and chronic murine models 
of urinary tract infection, as well as in response to pyruvate and serine added 
to growth media in vitro. Here, we show that proper regulation of yhjX in UPEC 
requires the presence of all components from both of these TCSs. By utilizing 
plasmid-encoded luciferase reporters tracking the activity of the yhjX and yjiY 
promoters, we demonstrate that deletions in one TCS substantially alter 
transcriptional activity of the opposing system's target gene. However, unlike 
in K12 E. coli, single gene deletions in the YpdA/YpdB system do not alter yjiY 
gene expression in UPEC, suggesting that niche and lifestyle-specific pressures 
may be selecting for differential cross-regulation of TCSs in pathogenic and 
non-pathogenic E. coli.

The peptide transporter carbon starvation (CstA) family (transporter 
classification [TC] 2.A.114) belongs to the second largest superfamily of 
secondary transporters, the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) superfamily. 
No representative of the CstA family has previously been characterized either 
biochemically or structurally, but we have now identified the function of one of 
its members, the transport protein YjiY of Escherichia coli Expression of the 
yjiY gene is regulated by the LytS-like histidine kinase BtsS, a sensor of 
extracellular pyruvate, together with the LytTR-like response regulator BtsR. 
YjiY consists of 716 amino acids, which form 18 putative transmembrane helices. 
Transport studies with intact cells provided evidence that YjiY is a specific 
and high-affinity transporter for pyruvate (Km , 16 μM). Furthermore, 
reconstitution of the purified YjiY into proteoliposomes revealed that YjiY is a 
pyruvate/H+ symporter. It has long been assumed that E. coli possesses a 
transporter(s) for pyruvate, but the present study is the first to definitively 
identify such a protein. Based on its function, we propose to change the name of 
the uncharacterized gene yjiY to btsT for Brenztraubensäure (the German word for 
pyruvate) transporter.IMPORTANCE BtsT (formerly known as YjiY) is found in many 
commensal and pathogenic representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae This study 
for the first time characterizes a pyruvate transporter in E. coli, BtsT, as a 
specific pyruvate/H+ symporter. When nutrients are limiting, BtsT takes up 
pyruvate from the medium, thus enabling it to be used as a carbon source for the 
growth and survival of E. coli.

Fluctuating environments and individual physiological diversity force bacteria 
to constantly adapt and optimize the uptake of substrates. We focus here on two 
very similar two-component systems (TCSs) of Escherichia coli belonging to the 
LytS/LytTR family: BtsS/BtsR (formerly YehU/YehT) and YpdA/YpdB. Both TCSs 
respond to extracellular pyruvate, albeit with different affinities, typically 
during postexponential growth, and each system regulates expression of a single 
transporter gene, yjiY and yhjX, respectively. To obtain insights into the 
biological significance of these TCSs, we analyzed the activation of the target 
promoters at the single-cell level. We found unimodal cell-to-cell variability; 
however, the degree of variance was strongly influenced by the available 
nutrients and differed between the two TCSs. We hypothesized that activation of 
either of the TCSs helps individual cells to replenish carbon resources. To test 
this hypothesis, we compared wild-type cells with the btsSR ypdAB mutant under 
two metabolically modulated conditions: protein overproduction and persister 
formation. Although all wild-type cells were able to overproduce green 
fluorescent protein (GFP), about half of the btsSR ypdAB population was unable 
to overexpress GFP. Moreover, the percentage of persister cells, which tolerate 
antibiotic stress, was significantly lower in the wild-type cells than in the 
btsSR ypdAB population. Hence, we suggest that the BtsS/BtsR and YpdA/YpdB 
network contributes to a balancing of the physiological state of all cells 
within a population.IMPORTANCE Histidine kinase/response regulator (HK/RR) 
systems enable bacteria to respond to environmental and physiological 
fluctuations. Escherichia coli and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae 
possess two similar LytS/LytTR-type HK/RRs, BtsS/BtsR (formerly YehU/YehT) and 
YpdA/YpdB, which form a functional network. Both systems are activated in 
response to external pyruvate, typically when cells face overflow metabolism 
during post-exponential growth. Single-cell analysis of the activation of their 
respective target genes yjiY and yhjX revealed cell-to-cell variability, and the 
range of variation was strongly influenced by externally available nutrients. 
Based on the phenotypic characterization of a btsSR ypdAB mutant compared to the 
parental strain, we suggest that this TCS network supports an optimization of 
the physiological state of the individuals within the population.

Bacterial histidine kinase/response regulator systems operate at the interface 
between environmental cues and physiological states. Escherichia coli contains 
two LytS/LytTR-type histidine kinase/response regulator systems, BtsS/BtsR 
(formerly YehU/YehT) and YpdA/YpdB, which have been identified as 
pyruvate-responsive two-component systems. Since they exhibit remarkable 
similarity, we analyzed their phylogenetic distribution within the 
γ-proteobacteria, and experimentally characterized them in a set of 
representative species. We found that BtsS/BtsR is the predominant 
LytS/LytTR-type two-component system among γ-proteobacteria, whereas YpdA/YpdB 
primarily appears in a supplementary role. Based on our observations in E. coli, 
we used the highly conserved DNA-binding motifs to test the in vivo 
functionality of both systems in various genera, including Salmonella, 
Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Xenorhabdus, Yersinia, Aeromonas and Vibrio. The 
results suggest that, in all cases tested, BtsS/BtsR and YpdA/YpdB respond to 
different levels of pyruvate in the environment.

Two-component systems are crucial for signal perception and modulation of 
bacterial behavior. Nevertheless, to date, very few ligands have been identified 
that directly interact with histidine kinases. The histidine kinase/response 
regulator system YehU/YehT of Escherichia coli is part of a nutrient-sensing 
network. Here we demonstrate that this system senses the onset of nutrient 
limitation in amino acid rich media and responds to extracellular pyruvate. 
Binding of radiolabeled pyruvate was found for full-length YehU in 
right-side-out membrane vesicles as well as for a truncated, membrane-integrated 
variant, confirming that YehU is a high-affinity receptor for extracellular 
pyruvate. Therefore we propose to rename YehU/YehT as BtsS/BtsR, after 
"Brenztraubensäure", the name given to pyruvic acid when it was first 
synthesized. The function of BtsS/BtsR was also assessed in a clinically 
relevant uropathogenic E. coli strain. Quantitative transcriptional analysis 
revealed BtsS/BtsR importance during acute and chronic urinary-tract infections.

Genes rcsC and rcsB form a two-component system in which rcsC encodes the sensor 
element and rcsB the regulator. In Escherichia coli, the system positively 
regulates the expression of the capsule operon, cps, and of the cell division 
gene ftsZ. We report the identification of the promoter and of the sequences 
required for rcsB-dependent stimulation of ftsZ expression. The promoter, 
ftsA1p, located in the ftsQ coding sequence, co-regulates ftsA and ftsZ. The 
sequences required for rcsB activity are immediately adjacent to this promoter.

essential protease FtsH in Escherichia coli.

Proteolysis is a universal strategy to rapidly adjust the amount of regulatory 
and metabolic proteins to cellular demand. FtsH is the only membrane-anchored 
and essential ATP-dependent protease in Escherichia coli. Among the known 
functions of FtsH are the control of the heat shock response by proteolysis of 
the transcription factor RpoH (σ(32)) and its essential role in 
lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis by degradation of the two key enzymes LpxC and 
KdtA. Here, we identified new FtsH substrates by using a proteomic-based 
substrate trapping approach. An FtsH variant (FtsH(trap)) carrying a single 
amino acid exchange in the proteolytic center was expressed and purified in E. 
coli. FtsH(trap) is devoid of its proteolytic activity but fully retains ATPase 
activity allowing for unfolding and translocation of substrates into the 
inactivated proteolytic chamber. Proteins associated with FtsH(trap) and 
wild-type FtsH (FtsH(WT)) were purified, separated by two-dimensional PAGE, and 
subjected to mass spectrometry. Over-representation of LpxC in the FtsH(trap) 
preparation validated the trapping strategy. Four novel FtsH substrates were 
identified. The sulfur delivery protein IscS and the d-amino acid dehydrogenase 
DadA were degraded under all tested conditions. The formate dehydrogenase 
subunit FdoH and the yet uncharacterized YfgM protein were subject to growth 
condition-dependent regulated proteolysis. Several lines of evidence suggest 
that YfgM serves as negative regulator of the RcsB-dependent stress response 
pathway, which must be degraded under stress conditions. The proteins captured 
by FtsH(trap) revealed previously unknown biological functions of the 
physiologically most important AAA(+) protease in E. coli.

LrhA regulates rpoS translation in response to the Rcs phosphorelay system in 
Escherichia coli.

Regulation of the Escherichia coli stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS is complex 
and occurs at multiple levels in response to different environmental stresses. 
One protein that reduces RpoS levels is the transcription factor LrhA, a global 
regulator of flagellar synthesis. Here we clarify the mechanism of this 
repression and provide insight into the signaling pathways that feed into this 
regulation. We show that LrhA represses RpoS at the level of translation in a 
manner that is dependent on the small RNA (sRNA) chaperone Hfq. Although LrhA 
also represses the transcription of the sRNA RprA, its regulation of RpoS mainly 
occurs independently of RprA. To better understand the physiological signals 
affecting this pathway, a transposon mutagenesis screen was carried out to find 
factors affecting LrhA activity levels. The RcsCDB phosphorelay system, a cell 
envelope stress-sensing pathway, was found to repress lrhA synthesis. In 
addition, mutations in the gene encoding the DNA motor protein FtsK induce lrhA 
synthesis, which may explain why such strains fail to accumulate RpoS in 
stationary phase.

The presumptive transcriptional regulator YjjQ has been identified as being 
virulence associated in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). In this work, 
we characterize YjjQ as transcriptional repressor of the flhDC operon, encoding 
the master regulator of flagellar synthesis, and of additional loci. The latter 
include gfc (capsule 4 synthesis), ompC (outer membrane porin C), yfiRNB 
(regulated c-di-GMP synthesis), and loci of poorly defined function (ybhL and 
ymiA-yciX). We identify the YjjQ DNA-binding sites at the flhDC and gfc 
promoters and characterize a DNA-binding sequence motif present at all promoters 
found to be repressed by YjjQ. At the flhDC promoter, the YjjQ DNA-binding site 
overlaps the RcsA-RcsB DNA-binding site. RcsA-RcsB likewise represses the flhDC 
promoter, but the repression by YjjQ and that by RcsA-RcsB are independent of 
each other. These data suggest that YjjQ is an additional regulator involved in 
the complex control of flhDC at the level of transcription initiation. 
Furthermore, we show that YjjQ represses motility of the E. coli K-12 laboratory 
strain and of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strains CFT073 and 536. Regulation of 
flhDC, yfiRNB, and additional loci by YjjQ may be features relevant for 
pathogenicity.
IMPORTANCE: Escherichia coli is a commensal and pathogenic bacterium causing 
intra- and extraintestinal infections in humans and farm animals. The 
pathogenicity of E. coli strains is determined by their particular genome 
content, which includes essential and associated virulence factors that control 
the cellular physiology in the host environment. However, the gene pools of 
commensal and pathogenic E. coli are not clearly differentiated, and the 
function of virulence-associated loci needs to be characterized. In this study, 
we characterize the function of yjjQ, encoding a transcription regulator that 
was identified as being virulence associated in avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC). 
We characterize YjjQ as transcriptional repressor of flagellar motility and of 
additional loci related to pathogenicity.

Introduction: Plantaricin BM-1 is a class IIa bacteriocin produced by 
Lactobacillus plantarum BM-1 that exerts significant antibacterial activity 
against many foodborne bacteria. Studies have shown that class IIa bacteriocins 
inhibit Gram-positive bacteria via the mannose phosphotransferase system; 
however, their mechanism of action against Gram-negative bacteria remains 
unknown. In this study, we explored the mechanism through which the Rcs 
phosphorelay affects the sensitivity of Escherichia coli K12 cells to 
plantaricin BM-1. Methods and Results: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 
plantaricin BM-1 against E. coli K12, E. coli JW5917 (rcsC mutant), E. coli 
JW2204 (rcsD mutant), and E. coli JW2205 (rcsB mutant) were 1.25, 0.59, 1.31, 
and 1.22 mg/ml, respectively. Growth curves showed that E. coli JW5917 
sensitivity to plantaricin BM-1 increased to the same level as that of E. coli 
K12 after complementation. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy and 
transmission electron microscopy revealed that, under the action of plantaricin 
BM-1, the appearance of E. coli JW5917 cells did not significantly differ from 
that of E. coli K12 cells; however, cell contents were significantly reduced and 
plasmolysis and shrinkage were observed at both ends. Crystal violet staining 
and laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that biofilm formation was 
significantly reduced after rcsC mutation, while proteomic analysis identified 
382 upregulated and 260 downregulated proteins in E. coli JW5917. In particular, 
rcsC mutation was found to affect the expression of proteins related to biofilm 
formation, with growth curve assays showing that the deletion of these proteins 
increased E. coli sensitivity to plantaricin BM-1. Discussion: Consequently, we 
speculated that the Rcs phosphorelay may regulate the sensitivity of E. coli to 
plantaricin BM-1 by affecting biofilm formation. This finding of class IIa 
bacteriocin against Gram-negative bacteria mechanism provides new insights.

Genome-wide protein-protein interaction (PPI) determination remains a 
significant unsolved problem in structural biology. The difficulty is twofold 
since high-throughput experiments (HTEs) have often a relatively high 
false-positive rate in assigning PPIs, and PPI quaternary structures are more 
difficult to solve than tertiary structures using traditional structural biology 
techniques. We proposed a uniform pipeline, Threpp, to address both problems. 
Starting from a pair of monomer sequences, Threpp first threads both sequences 
through a complex structure library, where the alignment score is combined with 
HTE data using a naïve Bayesian classifier model to predict the likelihood of 
two chains to interact with each other. Next, quaternary complex structures of 
the identified PPIs are constructed by reassembling monomeric alignments with 
dimeric threading frameworks through interface-specific structural alignments. 
The pipeline was applied to the Escherichia coli genome and created 35,125 
confident PPIs which is 4.5-fold higher than HTE alone. Graphic analyses of the 
PPI networks show a scale-free cluster size distribution, consistent with 
previous studies, which was found critical to the robustness of genome evolution 
and the centrality of functionally important proteins that are essential to E. 
coli survival. Furthermore, complex structure models were constructed for all 
predicted E. coli PPIs based on the quaternary threading alignments, where 6771 
of them were found to have a high confidence score that corresponds to the 
correct fold of the complexes with a TM-score >0.5, and 39 showed a close 
consistency with the later released experimental structures with an average 
TM-score = 0.73. These results demonstrated the significant usefulness of 
threading-based homologous modeling in both genome-wide PPI network detection 
and complex structural construction.

IgaA negatively regulates the Rcs Phosphorelay via contact with the RcsD 
Phosphotransfer Protein.

Two-component systems and phosphorelays play central roles in the ability of 
bacteria to rapidly respond to changing environments. In E. coli and related 
enterobacteria, the complex Rcs phosphorelay is a critical player in the 
bacterial response to antimicrobial peptides, beta-lactam antibiotics, and other 
disruptions at the cell surface. The Rcs system is unusual in that an inner 
membrane protein, IgaA, is essential due to its negative regulation of the 
RcsC/RcsD/RcsB phosphorelay. While it is known that IgaA transduces signals from 
the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF, how it interacts with the phosphorelay has 
remained unknown. Here we performed in vivo interaction assays and genetic 
dissection of the critical proteins and found that IgaA interacts with the 
phosphorelay protein RcsD, and that this interaction is necessary for 
regulation. Interactions between IgaA and RcsD within their respective 
periplasmic domains of these two proteins anchor repression of signaling. 
However, the signaling response depends on a second interaction between 
cytoplasmic loop 1 of IgaA and a truncated Per-Arndt-Sim (PAS-like) domain in 
RcsD. A single point mutation in the PAS-like domain increased interactions 
between the two proteins and blocked induction of the phosphorelay. IgaA may 
regulate RcsC, the histidine kinase that initiates phosphotransfer through the 
phosphorelay, indirectly, via its contacts with RcsD. Unlike RcsD, and unlike 
many other histidine kinases, the periplasmic domain of RcsC is dispensable for 
the response to signals that induce the Rcs phosphorelay system. The multiple 
contacts between IgaA and RcsD constitute a poised sensing system, preventing 
potentially toxic over-activation of this phosphorelay while enabling it to 
rapidly and quantitatively respond to signals.

Hybrid Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and uropathogenic E. coli 
(UPEC) strains of multilocus sequence type 141 (ST141) cause both urinary tract 
infections and diarrhea in humans and are phylogenetically positioned between 
STEC and UPEC strains. We used comparative genomic analysis of 85 temporally and 
spatially diverse ST141 E. coli strains, including 14 STEC/UPEC hybrids, 
collected in Germany (n = 13) and the United States (n = 1) to reconstruct their 
molecular evolution. Whole-genome sequencing data showed that 89% of the ST141 
E. coli strains either were STEC/UPEC hybrids or contained a mixture of 
virulence genes from other pathotypes. Core genome analysis and ancestral 
reconstruction revealed that the ST141 E. coli strains clustered into two 
lineages that evolved from a common ancestor in the mid-19th century. The 
STEC/UPEC hybrid emerged ∼100 years ago by acquiring an stx prophage, which 
integrated into previously unknown insertion site between rcsB and rcsD, 
followed by the insertion of a pathogenicity island (PAI) similar to PAI II of 
UPEC strain 536 (PAI II536-like). The two variants of PAI II536-like were 
associated with tRNA genes leuX and pheU, respectively. Finally, microevolution 
within PAI II536-like and acquisition of the enterohemorrhagic E. coli plasmid 
were observed. Our data suggest that intestinal pathogenic E. coli 
(IPEC)/extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) hybrids are widespread and 
that selection pressure within the ST141 E. coli population led to the emergence 
of the STEC/UPEC hybrid as a clinically important subgroup. We hypothesize that 
ST141 E. coli strains serve as a melting pot for pathogroup conversion between 
IPEC and ExPEC, contrasting the classical theory of pathogen emergence from 
nonpathogens and corroborating our recent phenomenon of heteropathogenicity 
among pathogenic E. coli strains.

Reassessing the role of the Escherichia coli CpxAR system in sensing surface 
contact.

Institute, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.

For proper biofilm formation, bacteria must have mechanisms in place to sense 
adhesion to surfaces. In Escherichia coli, the CpxAR and RcsCDB systems have 
been reported to sense surfaces. The CpxAR system is widely considered to be 
responsible for sensing attachment, specifically to hydrophobic surfaces. Here, 
using both single-cell and population-level analyses, we confirm RcsCDB 
activation upon surface contact, but find that the CpxAR system is not 
activated, in contrast to what had earlier been reported. Thus, the role of 
CpxAR in surface sensing and initiation of biofilm formation should be 
reconsidered.

The Complex Rcs Regulatory Cascade.

RcsB, a response regulator of the FixJ/NarL family, is at the center of a 
complex network of regulatory inputs and outputs. Cell surface stress is sensed 
by an outer membrane lipoprotein, RcsF, which regulates interactions of the 
inner membrane protein IgaA, lifting negative regulation of a phosphorelay. In 
vivo evidence supports a pathway in which histidine kinase RcsC transfers 
phosphate to phosphotransfer protein RcsD, resulting in phosphorylation of RcsB. 
RcsB acts either alone or in combination with RcsA to positively regulate 
capsule synthesis and synthesis of small RNA (sRNA) RprA as well as other genes, 
and to negatively regulate motility. RcsB in combination with other FixJ/NarL 
auxiliary proteins regulates yet other functions, independent of RcsB 
phosphorylation. Proper expression of Rcs and its targets is critical for 
success of Escherichia coli commensal strains, for proper development of 
biofilm, and for virulence in some pathogens. New understanding of how the Rcs 
phosphorelay works provides insight into the flexibility of the two-component 
system paradigm.

When 10 Escherichia coli mutant strains with defects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
core biosynthesis were grown on agar medium at 30°C, four of them, the ΔwaaF, 
ΔwaaG, ΔwaaP, and ΔwaaB strains, formed mucoid colonies, while the other six, 
the ΔwaaU, ΔwaaR, ΔwaaO, ΔwaaC, ΔwaaQ, and ΔwaaY strains, did not. Using light 
microscopy with tannin mordant staining, the presence of exopolysaccharide 
around the cells of the mutants that formed mucoid colonies could be discerned. 
The ΔwaaF mutant produced the largest amounts of exopolysaccharide, regardless 
of whether it was grown on agar or in liquid medium. The exopolysaccharide was 
isolated from the liquid growth medium of ΔwaaF cells, hydrolyzed, and analyzed 
by high-performance liquid chromatography with an ion-exchange column, and the 
results indicated that the exopolysaccharide was consistent with colanic acid. 
When the key genes related to the biosynthesis of colanic acid, i.e., wza, wzb, 
wzc, and wcaA, were deleted in the ΔwaaF background, the exopolysaccharide could 
not be produced any more, further confirming that it was colanic acid. Colanic 
acid could not be produced in strains in which rcsA, rcsB, rcsD, or rcsF was 
deleted in the ΔwaaF background, but a reduced level of colanic acid production 
was detected when the rcsC gene was deleted, suggesting that a change of 
lipopolysaccharide structure in ΔwaaF cells might be sensed by the RcsCDB 
phosphorelay system, leading to the production of colanic acid. The results 
demonstrate that E. coli cells can activate colanic acid production through the 
RcsCDB phosphorelay system in response to a structural deficiency of 
lipopolysaccharide.
IMPORTANCE: Lipopolysaccharide and colanic acid are important forms of 
exopolysaccharide for Escherichia coli cells. Their metabolism and biological 
significance have been investigated, but their interrelation with the cell 
stress response process is not understood. This study demonstrates, for the 
first time, that E. coli cells can activate colanic acid production through the 
RcsCDB phosphorelay system in response to a structural change of 
lipopolysaccharide, suggesting that bacterial cells can monitor the outer 
membrane integrity, which is essential for cell survival and damage repair.

RcsC is a hybrid histidine kinase that forms part of a phospho-relay signal 
transduction pathway with RcsD and RcsB. Besides the typical domains of a sensor 
kinase, i.e. the periplasmic (P), linker (L), dimerization and H-containing (A), 
and ATP-binding (B) domains, RcsC possesses a receiver domain (D) at the 
carboxy-terminal domain. To study the role played by each of the RcsC domains, 
four plasmids containing several of these domains were constructed (PLAB, LAB, 
AB and ABD) and transformed into Escherichia coli K-12 strain BW25113. Different 
amounts of biofilm were produced, depending on the RcsC domains expressed: the 
plasmid expressing the ABD subdomains produced the highest amount of biofilm. 
This phenotype was also observed when the plasmids were transformed in a ΔrcsCDB 
strain. Biofilm formation was abolished in the pgaABCD and nhaR backgrounds. The 
results indicate the existence of a novel signalling pathway that depends on 
RcsC, yet independent of RcsD and RcsB, that activates the pgaABCD operon and, 
as a consequence, biofilm formation. This signalling pathway involves the 
secondary metabolite acetyl phosphate and the response regulator OmpR.

The Rcs phosphorelay pathway is a complex signaling pathway involved in the 
regulation of many cell surface structures in enteric bacteria. In response to 
environmental stimuli, the sensor histidine kinase (RcsC) autophosphorylates and 
then transfers the phosphate through intermediary steps to the response 
regulator (RcsB), which, once phosphorylated, regulates gene expression. Here, 
we show that Salmonella biofilm development depends on the phosphorylation 
status of RcsB. Thus, unphosphorylated RcsB, hitherto assumed to be inactive, is 
essential to activate the expression of the biofilm matrix compounds. The 
prevention of RcsB phosphorylation either by the disruption of the phosphorelay 
at the RcsC or RcsD level or by the production of a nonphosphorylatable RcsB 
allele induces biofilm development. On the contrary, the phosphorylation of RcsB 
by the constitutive activation of the Rcs pathway inhibits biofilm development, 
an effect that can be counteracted by the introduction of a nonphosphorylatable 
RcsB allele. The inhibition of biofilm development by phosphorylated RcsB is due 
to the repression of CsgD expression, through a mechanism dependent on the 
accumulation of the small noncoding RNA RprA. Our results indicate that 
unphosphorylated RcsB plays an active role for integrating environmental signals 
and, more broadly, that RcsB phosphorylation acts as a key switch between 
planktonic and sessile life-styles in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.

The response regulator RcsB activates expression of Mat fimbriae in meningitic 
Escherichia coli.

Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.

The common colonization factor of Escherichia coli, the Mat (also termed ECP) 
fimbria, functions to advance biofilm formation on inert surfaces as well as 
bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and subsequent colonization. We used 
global mini-Tn5 transposon mutagenesis to identify novel regulators of biofilm 
formation by the meningitic E. coli isolate IHE 3034. Of the 4,418 
transformants, we found 17 that were impaired in biofilm formation. Most of 
these mutants were affected in lipopolysaccharide synthesis and were reduced in 
growth but not in Mat fimbria expression. In contrast, two mutants grew well but 
did not express Mat fimbria. The insertions in these two mutants were located at 
different sites of the rcsB gene, which encodes a DNA-binding response regulator 
of the Rcs response regulon. The mutations abrogated temperature-dependent 
biofilm formation by IHE 3034, and the phenotype correlated with loss of mat 
expression. The defect in biofilm formation in the rcsB mutant was reversed upon 
complementation with rcsB as well as by overexpression of structural mat genes 
but not by overexpression of the fimbria-specific activator gene matA. 
Monitoring of the mat operon promoter activity with chromosomal reporter fusions 
showed that the RcsB protein and an RcsAB box in the mat regulatory region, but 
not RcsC, RcsD, AckA, and Pta, are essential for initiation of mat 
transcription. Gel retardation assays showed that RcsB specifically binds to the 
mat promoter DNA, which enables its function in promoting biofilm formation by 
E. coli.

Global Regulator of Virulence A (GrvA) Coordinates Expression of Discrete 
Pathogenic Mechanisms in Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli through Interactions 
with GadW-GadE.

Global regulator of virulence A (GrvA) is a ToxR-family transcriptional 
regulator that activates locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-dependent 
adherence in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). LEE activation by GrvA 
requires the Rcs phosphorelay response regulator RcsB and is sensitive to 
physiologically relevant concentrations of bicarbonate, a known stimulant of 
virulence systems in intestinal pathogens. This study determines the genomic 
scale of GrvA-dependent regulation and uncovers details of the molecular 
mechanism underlying GrvA-dependent regulation of pathogenic mechanisms in EHEC. 
In a grvA-null background of EHEC strain TW14359, RNA sequencing analysis 
revealed the altered expression of over 700 genes, including the downregulation 
of LEE- and non-LEE-encoded effectors and the upregulation of genes for 
glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR). Upregulation of GDAR genes 
corresponded with a marked increase in acid resistance. GrvA-dependent 
regulation of GDAR and the LEE required gadE, the central activator of GDAR 
genes and a direct repressor of the LEE. Control of gadE by GrvA was further 
determined to occur through downregulation of the gadE activator GadW. This 
interaction of GrvA with GadW-GadE represses the acid resistance phenotype, 
while it concomitantly activates the LEE-dependent adherence and secretion of 
immune subversion effectors. The results of this study significantly broaden the 
scope of GrvA-dependent regulation and its role in EHEC pathogenesis.
IMPORTANCE: Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an intestinal human 
pathogen causing acute hemorrhagic colitis and life-threatening hemolytic-uremic 
syndrome. For successful transmission and gut colonization, EHEC relies on the 
glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) system and a type III secretion 
apparatus, encoded on the LEE pathogenicity island. This study investigates the 
mechanism whereby the DNA-binding regulator GrvA coordinates activation of the 
LEE with repression of GDAR. Investigating how these systems are regulated leads 
to an understanding of pathogenic behavior and novel strategies aimed at disease 
prevention and control.

AtoSC two-component system (TCS) upregulates the high-molecular weight 
poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) biosynthesis in recombinant phaCAB (+) 
Escherichia coli strains, with the Cupriavidus necator phaCAB operon. We report 
here that AtoSC upregulates also the copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) biosynthesis in 
phaCAB (+) E. coli. Acetoacetate-induced AtoSC maximized P(3HB-co-3HV) to 
1.27 g/l with a 3HV fraction of 25.5 % wt. and biopolymer content of 75 % w/w in 
a time-dependent process. The atoSC locus deletion in the ∆atoSC strains 
resulted in 4.5-fold P(3HB-co-3HV) reduction, while the 3HV fraction of the 
copolymer was restricted to only 6.4 % wt. The ∆atoSC phenotype was restored by 
extrachromosomal introduction of AtoSC. Deletion of the atoDAEB operon triggered 
a significant decrease in P(3HB-co-3HV) synthesis and 3HV content in ∆atoDAEB 
strains. However, the acetoacetate-induced AtoSC in those strains increased 
P(3HB-co-3HV) to 0.8 g/l with 21 % 3HV, while AtoC or AtoS expression increased 
P(3HB-co-3HV) synthesis 3.6- or 2.4-fold, respectively, upon acetoacetate. 
Complementation of the ∆atoDAEB phenotype was achieved by the extrachromosomal 
introduction of the atoSCDAEB regulon. Individual inhibition of β-oxidation and 
mainly fatty acid biosynthesis pathways by acrylic acid or cerulenin, 
respectively, reduced P(3HB-co-3HV) biosynthesis. Under those conditions, 
introduction of atoSC or atoSCDAEB regulon was capable of upregulating 
biopolymer accumulation. Concurrent inhibition of both the fatty acid metabolic 
pathways eliminated P(3HB-co-3HV) production. P(3HB-co-3HV) upregulation in 
phaCAB (+) E. coli by AtoSC signaling through atoDAEB operon and its 
participation in the fatty acids metabolism interplay provide additional 
perceptions of AtoSC critical involvement in E. coli regulatory processes 
towards biotechnologically improved polyhydroxyalkanoates biosynthesis.

Verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine are Ca(2+)-channel blockers used in 
cardiovascular diseases. We report here that the Escherichia coli AtoSC 
signaling is inhibited by those blockers. AtoSC two-component system plays a 
pivotal role in sophisticated signaling networks in E. coli regulating processes 
implicated in bacterial homeostasis and pathogenicity. The Ca(2+)-channel 
blockers abrogated the in vitro full-length AtoS kinase autophosphorylation. 
However, they demonstrated no effect on the AtoS cytoplasmic form 
autophosphorylation. AtoC protected AtoS from verapamil or diltiazem but not 
from nifedipine, when the two constituents formed complex. The blockers did not 
affect the AtoS≈P to AtoC phosphotransfer. The blockers-mediated AtoSC 
inhibition was verified in vivo on the atoDAEB expression, which was inhibited 
only in AtoSC-expressing bacteria upon acetoacetate. The AtoS and AtoC protein 
or their genes transcription levels were unaffected by the blockers. Blockers 
demonstrated differential effects in the regulation of both the cytosolic- and 
most potently the membrane-bound-cPHB. Extracellular Ca(2+) counteracted the 
verapamil-mediated effect on cPHB only in atoSC(+) cells. Extracellular Ca(2+) 
reversed the diltiazem-mediated cPHB decreases in cells of both genetic 
backgrounds, yet a Ca(2+)-concentration dependent reversion was observed only in 
the AtoSC-regulated cPHB. Nifedipine caused a more pronounced cPHB 
down-regulation that was not reversed by extracellular Ca(2+). The AtoSC 
signaling inhibition by Ca(2+)-channel blockers used for human treatment, and

AtoSC two-component system plays a pivotal role in many regulatory indispensable 
Escherichia coli processes. AtoSCDAEB regulon, comprising the AtoSC system and 
the atoDAEB operon, regulates the short-chain fatty acids catabolism. We report 
here, that AtoSC up-regulates the high-molecular weight PHB biosynthesis, in 
recombinant phaCAB(+)E. coli, with the Cupriavidus necator phaCAB operon. PHB 
accumulation was maximized upon the acetoacetate-mediated induction of AtoSC, 
under glucose 1% w/v, resulting in a yield of 1.73 g/l with a biopolymer content 
of 64.5% w/w. The deletion of the atoSC locus, in the ΔatoSC strains, resulted 
in a 5 fold reduction of PHB accumulation, which was restored by the 
extrachromosomal introduction of the AtoSC system. The deletion of the atoDAEB 
operon triggered a significant decrease in PHB synthesis in ΔatoDAEB strains. 
However, the acetoacetate-induced AtoSC system in those strains increased PHB to 
1.55 g/l, while AtoC expression increased PHB to 1.4 g/l upon acetoacetate. The 
complementation of the ΔatoDAEB phenotype was achieved by the extrachromosomal 
introduction of the atoSCDAEB regulon. The individual inhibition of β-oxidation 
and mainly fatty-acid biosynthesis pathways by acrylic acid or cerulenin 
respectively, reduced PHB biosynthesis. Under those conditions the introduction 
of the atoSC locus or the atoSCDAEB regulon was capable to up-regulate the 
biopolymer accumulation. The concurrent inhibition of both the fatty acids 
metabolic pathways eliminated PHB production. PHB up-regulation in phaCAB(+)E. 
coli, by AtoSC signaling through atoDAEB operon and its participation in the 
fatty acids metabolism interplay, provide additional perceptions of AtoSC 
critical involvement in E. coli regulatory processes towards the 
biotechnologically improved polyhydroxyalkanoates biosynthesis.

The AtoSC two-component system in Escherichia coli is a key regulator of many 
physiological processes. We report here the contribution of AtoSC in E. coli 
motility and chemotaxis. AtoSC locus deletion in ΔatoSC cells renders cells not 
motile or responsive against any chemoattractant or repellent independently of 
the AtoSC inducer's presence. AtoSC expression through plasmid complemented the 
ΔatoSC phenotype. Cells expressing either AtoS or AtoC demonstrated analogous 
motility and chemotactic phenotypes as ΔatoSC cells, independently of AtoSC 
inducer's presence. Mutations of AtoC phosphate-acceptor sites diminished or 
abrogated E. coli chemotaxis. trAtoC, the AtoC constitutive active form which 
lacks its receiver domain, up-regulated E. coli motility. AtoSC enhanced the 
transcription of the flhDC and fliAZY operons and to a lesser extent of the 
flgBCDEFGHIJKL operon. The AtoSC-mediated regulation of motility and chemotactic 
response required also the expression of the CheAY system. The AtoSC inducers 
enhanced the AtoSC-mediated motility and chemotaxis. Acetoacetate or spermidine 
further promoted the responses of only AtoSC-expressing cells, while Ca(2+) 
demonstrated its effects independently of AtoSC. Histamine regulated bacterial 
chemotaxis only in atoSC (+) cells in a concentration-dependent manner while 
reversed the AtoSC-mediated effects when added at high concentrations. The 
trAtoC-controlled motility effects were enhanced by acetoacetate or spermidine, 
but not by histamine. These data reveal that AtoSC system regulates the motility 
and chemotaxis of E. coli, participating in the transcriptional induction of the 
main promoters of the chemotactic regulon and modifying the motility and 
chemotactic phenotypes in an induction-dependent mechanism.

The Escherichia coli AtoSC two component system;upon acetoacetate 
induction;regulates the expression of the atoDAEB operon;through His→Asp 
phopshotransfer;thus modulating important cellular processes. In this report the 
effect of seven 5,7,8-trimethyl-1,4-benzoxazine derivatives on the regulation of 
the E. coli AtoSC system was studied. The new compounds were tested for their 
effectiveness on the expression of the atoC and the regulated atoDAEB operon. 
The non-substituted 5,7,8-trimethyl-1,4-benzoxazine (4a), was the most potent 
inducer on atoC transcription;resulting in accumulation of AtoC protein. The 
induction of atoC by 4a was specific;since no effect was observed on the other 
genes of the system (atoS and atoDAEB). Moreover;compound 4a was shown to 
significantly up-regulate the in vitro kinase activity of the histidine kinase 
AtoS without altering the protein levels in the cell. Interestingly;this 
compound appeared to modulate the acetoacetate-mediated induction of the atoDAEB 
promoter by the AtoSC system. These data provide the first evidence for a 
differential modulator role of 5,7,8-trimethyl-1,4-benzoxazine;on the AtoSC two 
component system mediated signaling.

Inhibition of the signal transduction through the AtoSC system by histidine 
kinase inhibitors in Escherichia coli.

Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GR-54124, Greece. evatheod@physics.auth.gr

AtoSC two-component system participates in many indispensable processes of 
Escherichia coli. We report here that the AtoSC signal transduction is inhibited 
by established histidine kinase inhibitors. Closantel, RWJ-49815 and TNP-ATP 
belonging to different chemical classes of inhibitors, abrogated the in vitro 
AtoS kinase autophosphorylation. However, when AtoS was embedded in the membrane 
fractions, higher inhibitor concentrations were required for total inhibition. 
When AtoS interacted with AtoC forming complex, the intrinsic histidine kinase 
was protected by the response regulator, requiring increased inhibitors 
concentrations for partially AtoS autophosphorylation reduction. The inhibitors 
exerted an additional function on AtoSC, blocking the phosphotransfer from AtoS 
to AtoC, without however, affecting AtoC~P dephosphorylation. Their in vivo 
consequences through the AtoSC inhibition were elucidated on atoDAEB operon 
expression, which was inhibited only in AtoSC-expressing bacteria where AtoSC 
was induced by acetoacetate or spermidine. The inhibitor effects were extended 
on the AtoSC regulatory role on cPHB [complexed poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] 
biosynthesis. cPHB was decreased upon the blockers only in acetoacetate-induced 
AtoSC-expressing cells. Increased ATP amounts during bacterial growth reversed 
the inhibitory TNP-ATP-mediated effect on cPHB. The alteration of pivotal E. 
coli processes as an outcome of AtoSC inhibition, establish this system as a 
target of two-component systems inhibitors.

AtoSC two-component system is involved in cPHB biosynthesis through fatty acid 
metabolism in E. coli.

Greece.

BACKGROUND: We have shown previously that AtoSC two-component system regulates 
the biosynthesis of E. coli cPHB [complexed poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate].
METHODS: The AtoSC involvement on fatty acids metabolism, towards cPHB 
synthesis, was studied using cPHB determination, gene expression, and fatty acid 
metabolic pathways inhibitors.
RESULTS: Deletion of the atoDAEB operon from the E. coli genome resulted in a 
consistent reduction of cPHB accumulation. When in ΔatoDAEB cells, the atoDAEB 
operon and the AtoSC system were introduced extrachromosomally, a significant 
enhancement of cPHB levels was observed. Moreover, the introduction of a plasmid 
with atoSC genes regulated positively cPHB biosynthesis. A lesser cPHB 
enhancement was triggered when plasmids carrying either atoS or atoC were 
introduced. The intracellular distribution of cPHB was regulated by AtoSC or 
AtoC according to the inducer (acetoacetate or spermidine). Blockage of 
β-oxidation by acrylic acid reduced cPHB levels, suggesting the involvement of 
this pathway in cPHB synthesis; however, the overproduction of AtoSC or its 
constituents separately resulted in cPHB enhancement. Inhibition of fatty acid 
biosynthesis by cerulenin resulted to a major cPHB reduction, indicating the 
contribution of this pathway in cPHB production. Inhibition of both β-oxidation 
and fatty acid biosynthesis reduced dramatically cPHB, suggesting the 
contribution of both pathways in cPHB biosynthesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Short fatty acid catabolism (atoDAEB operon) and fatty acids 
metabolic pathways participate in cPHB synthesis through the involvement of 
AtoSC system.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The involvement of the AtoSC system in the fatty acids 
metabolic pathways interplay towards cPHB biosynthesis provides additional 
perceptions of AtoSC role on E. coli regulatory biochemical processes.

Bacterial signal transduction systems can be viewed as an entity of 
multi-sensory and output domains, whereas the functions of response regulators 
play a pivotal role in the complex network interactions. One crucial property 
among response regulators functions is their oligomerization and subsequent 
binding to DNA. The AtoS-AtoC two component system, functionally modulated by 
various agents, influences fundamental cellular processes such as short-chain 
fatty acid catabolism and poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate biosynthesis in Escherichia 
coli. Among the already reported characteristic properties, AtoC binds to a 
specific site, a palindromic repeat of 20 nucleotides within the atoDAEB 
promoter. Since experimental structures of AtoC or its complex with DNA are not 
yet available, an almost complete homology model of AtoC and of its putative 
entity as a dimer is constructed for this study, as well as a model of its 
binding to its target DNA sequence. The latter is associated with large 
conformational changes, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequent 
biochemical study, including cross-linking via chemical agents, revealed the 
ability of AtoC to form oligomers in vitro.

The AtoSC two-component system in E. coli consists of the AtoS sensor kinase and 
the AtoC response regulator. It regulates positively the transcriptional 
activation of atoDAEB operon, encoding enzymes involved in short-chain fatty 
acid catabolism upon acetoacetate-mediated induction. AtoSC acting on atoDAEB 
operon, regulates the biosynthesis and the intracellular distribution of 
short-chain poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (cPHB). A phosphorylation-incompetent 
AtoC form was constructed lacking its N-terminal receiver domain, trAtoC, to 
study the effects of AtoC domains on cPHB biosynthesis and atoDAEB operon 
regulation. Both cPHB biosynthesis and atoDAEB gene expression were regulated 
positively by trAtoC in the absence of any inducer in E. coli of both atoSC (+) 
and ΔatoSC genotypes. The presence of acetoacetate or spermidine further 
promoted these trAtoC actions. Competitive regulatory functions between the full 
length AtoC and trAtoC were observed referring to atoDAEB and cPHB targets as 
well as growth of trAtoC-overproducing atoSC (+) cells on butyrate as the sole 
carbon source. trAtoC in contrast to the wild-type AtoC presented different 
modes of cPHB and atoDAEB regulation in the presence of compounds involved in 
fatty acid metabolism including CoA-SH, acetyl-CoA, sodium acetate or 
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. These data provide evidence for a role of the AtoC 
N-terminal receiver domain in regulating the biological activities of AtoSC as 
well as additional mechanisms of interactions between the AtoSC constituents 
including their established inducers or new effectors towards the accomplishment 
of the AtoSC TCS signal transduction.

Signal transduction and adaptive regulation through bacterial two-component 
systems: the Escherichia coli AtoSC paradigm.

Adaptive signal transduction within microbial cells involves a multi-faceted 
regulated phosphotransfer mechanism that comprises structural rearrangements of 
sensor histidine kinases upon ligand-binding and phosphorylation-induced 
conformational changes in response regulators of versatile two-component systems 
(TCS), arisen early in bacterial evolution. In Escherichia coli, cross-talk 
between the AtoS histidine kinase and the AtoC response regulator, forming the 
AtoSC TCS, through His --> Asp phosphotransfer, activates AtoC directly to 
induce atoDAEB operon expression, thus modulating diverse fundamental cellular 
processes such as short-chain fatty acid catabolism, poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate 
biosynthesis and chemotaxis. Among the inducers hitherto identified, 
acetoacetate is the classical activator. The AtoSC TCS functional modulation by 
polyamines, histamine and Ca(2+), as well as the role of AtoC as transcriptional 
regulator, add new promising perspectives in the physiological significance and 
potential pharmacological exploitation of this TCS in cell proliferation, 
bacteria-host interactions, chemotaxis, and adaptation.

Type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli facilitate attachment to the host mucosa and 
promote biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces. The transcriptional regulator 
LrhA, which is known as a repressor of flagellar, motility and chemotaxis genes, 
regulates biofilm formation and expression of type 1 fimbriae. Whole-genome 
expression profiling revealed that inactivation of lrhA results in an increased 
expression of structural components of type 1 fimbriae. In vitro, LrhA bound to 
the promoter regions of the two fim recombinases (FimB and FimE) that catalyse 
the inversion of the fimA promoter, and to the invertible element itself. 
Translational lacZ fusions with these genes and quantification of fimE 
transcript levels by real-time PCR showed that LrhA influences type 1 fimbrial 
phase variation, primarily via activation of FimE, which is required for the 
ON-to-OFF transition of the fim switch. Enhanced type 1 fimbrial expression as a 
result of lrhA disruption was confirmed by mannose-sensitive agglutination of 
yeast cells. Biofilm formation was stimulated by lrhA inactivation and 
completely suppressed upon LrhA overproduction. The effects of LrhA on biofilm 
formation were exerted via the changed levels of surface molecules, most 
probably both flagella and type 1 fimbriae. Together, the data show a role for 
LrhA as a repressor of type 1 fimbrial expression, and thus as a regulator of 
the initial stages of biofilm development and, presumably, bacterial adherence 
to epithelial host cells also.

We have characterized four genes from the 52-min region on the Escherichia coli 
linkage map. Three of these genes are directly involved in the metabolism of 
xanthosine, whereas the function of the fourth gene is unknown. One of the genes 
(xapA) encodes xanthosine phosphorylase. The second gene, named xapB, encodes a 
polypeptide that shows strong similarity to the nucleoside transport protein 
NupG. The genes xapA and xapB are located clockwise of a gene identified as 
xapR, which encodes a positive regulator belonging to the LysR family and is 
required for the expression of xapA and xapB. The genes xapA and xapB form an 
operon, and their expression was strictly dependent on the presence of both the 
XapR protein and the inducer xanthosine. Expression of the xapR gene is 
constitutive and not autoregulated, unlike the case for many other LysR family 
proteins. In minicells, the XapB polypeptide was found primarily in the membrane 
fraction, indicating that XapB is a transport protein like NupG and is involved 
in the transport of xanthosine.

Cobalt can be toxic and the way cells adapt to its presence is largely unknown. 
Here we carried out a transcriptomic analysis of Escherichia coli exposed to 
cobalt. A limited number of genes were either up- or downregulated. Upregulated 
genes include the isc and the nfuA genes encoding Fe/S biogenesis assisting 
factors, and the rcnA gene encoding a cobalt efflux system. Downregulated genes 
are implicated in anaerobic metabolism (narK, nirB, hybO, grcA), metal transport 
(feoB, nikA), sulfate/thiosulfate import (cysP), and one is of unknown function 
(yeeE). Cobalt regulation of isc, nfuA, hybO, cysP and yeeE genes was found to 
involve IscR, a Fe/S transcriptional regulator. Previously, the Suf Fe/S 
biogenesis machinery was found to be important for cobalt stress adaptation, but 
suf genes did not show up in the microarray analysis. Therefore, we used qRT-PCR 
analysis and found that cobalt induced the suf operon expression. Moreover, 
kinetic analysis of the cobalt-mediated induction of the suf operon expression 
allowed us to propose that cobalt toxicity is caused first by impaired Fe/S 
biogenesis, followed by decreased iron bioavailability and eventually oxidative 
stress.

Fe-S clusters are essential across the biological world, yet how cells regulate 
expression of Fe-S cluster biogenesis pathways to cope with changes in Fe-S 
cluster demand is not well understood. Here, we describe the mechanism by which 
IscR, a [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing regulator of Escherichia coli, adjusts the 
synthesis of the Isc Fe-S biogenesis pathway to maintain Fe-S homeostasis. Our 
data indicate that a negative feedback loop operates to repress transcription of 
the iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx operon, encoding IscR and the Isc machinery, through 
binding of [2Fe-2S]-IscR to two upstream binding sites. IscR was shown to 
require primarily the Isc pathway for synthesis of its Fe-S cluster, providing a 
link between IscR activity and demands for Fe-S clusters through the levels of 
the Isc system. Surprisingly, the isc operon was more repressed under anaerobic 
conditions, indicating increased Fe-S cluster occupancy of IscR and decreased 
Fe-S cluster biogenesis demand relative to aerobic conditions. Consistent with 
this notion, overexpression of a Fe-S protein under aerobic conditions, but not 
under anaerobic conditions, led to derepression of P(iscR). Together, these data 
show how transcriptional control of iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx by [2Fe-2S]-IscR allows 
E. coli to respond efficiently to varying Fe-S demands.

IscS plays a principal role in the synthesis of sulfur-containing biomolecules. 
It is known that the expression of iscS can be negatively regulated by IscR, the 
first gene product of iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx. What governs the regulation of cysteine 
desulfurase activity, however, is unknown. Here, we report that IscS from 
Escherichia coli is able to bind iron with an association constant of 
1.6x10(17)M(-1) to form an IscS-iron complex. IscS is also capable of binding 
both iron and sulfide to form an IscS-iron-sulfide complex with a higher 
affinity. The desulfurase activity is gradually inhibited as the amount of iron 
and sulfide bound to IscS increases. When 2Fe-2S binds IscS, about 20% of the 
activity is inhibited; when 8Fe-8S adheres to IscS, about 70% of the activity is 
inhibited. Thus, the cell is able to modulate its desulfurase activity with the 
formation of an IscS-iron-sulfide complex.

IscR is an iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster-containing transcription factor that 
represses transcription of the operon containing its own gene and the 
iscSUA-hscBA-fdx genes, whose products are involved in Fe-S cluster biogenesis. 
In this study, global transcriptional profiling of Escherichia coli IscR(+) and 
IscR(-) strains grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions indicated that 40 
genes in 20 predicted operons were regulated by IscR. DNase I footprinting 
and/or in vitro transcription reactions identified seven new promoters under 
direct IscR control. Among these were genes encoding known or proposed functions 
in Fe-S cluster biogenesis (sufABCDSE, yadR and yhgI) and Fe-S 
cluster-containing anaerobic respiratory enzymes (hyaABCDEF, hybOABCDEFG and 
napFDAGHBC). The finding that IscR repressed expression of the hyaA, hybO and 
napF promoters specifically under aerobic growth conditions suggests a new 
mechanism to explain their upregulation under anaerobic growth conditions. 
Phylogenetic footprinting of the DNase I protected regions of seven promoters 
implies that there are at least two different classes of IscR binding sites 
conserved among many bacteria. The findings presented here indicate a more 
general role of IscR in the regulation of Fe-S cluster biogenesis and that IscR 
contributes to the O(2) regulation of several promoters controlling the 
expression of anaerobic Fe-S proteins.

The assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, a key step in the 
post-translational maturation of Fe-S proteins, is mediated by a complex 
apparatus. In E. coli, this process involves two independent systems called ISC 
and SUF encoded by the iscSUA-hscBA-fdx gene cluster and sufABCDSE operon, 
respectively. Another system, termed NIF (nifSU), is required for the maturation 
of nitrogenase in nitrogen-fixing bacteria. We have developed a novel genetic 
system to gain further insight into these multi-component systems, and to 
determine how ISC, SUF and NIF might differ in their roles in Fe-S assembly. We 
have constructed an E. coli mutant lacking both the isc and suf operons, and 
this strain can only survive in the presence of a complementing plasmid. Using 
the plasmid replacement technique, we examined the isc and suf operons, and 
identified the genes essential for the function. Additionally, we have found 
that nifSU-like genes cloned from Helicobacter pylori are functionally 
exchangeable with the isc and suf operons. Thus, the NIF-like system 
participates in the maturation of a wide variety of Fe-S proteins. An increased 
ability of NIF to complement isc and suf loss was seen under anaerobic 
conditions. This may explain why the NIF system is only found in a limited 
number of bacterial species, and most other organisms prefer the ISC and/or SUF 
systems. While the differences between ISC and SUF were small with respect to 
the complementing activity, the SUF system appears to be more advantageous for 
bacterial growth in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.

The iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, the nonheme-iron cofactor essential for the 
activity of many proteins, is incorporated into target proteins with the aid of 
complex machinery. In bacteria, several proteins encoded by the 
iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx-ORF3 cluster (isc operon) have been proposed to execute 
crucial tasks in the assembly of Fe-S clusters. To elucidate the in vivo 
function, we have undertaken a systematic mutational analysis of the genes in 
the Escherichia coli isc operon. In all functional tests, i.e. growth rate, 
nutritional requirements and activities of Fe-S enzymes, the inactivation of the 
iscS gene elicited the most drastic alteration. Strains with mutations in the 
iscU, hscB, hscA, and fdx genes also exhibited conspicuous phenotypical 
consequences almost identical to one another. The effect of the inactivation of 
iscA was small but appreciable on Fe-S enzymes. In contrast, mutants with 
inactivated iscR or ORF3 showed virtually no differences from wild-type cells. 
The requirement of iscSUA-hscBA-fdx for the assembly of Fe-S clusters was 
further confirmed by complementation experiments using a mutant strain in which 
the entire isc operon was deleted. Our findings support the conclusion that 
IscS, via cysteine desulfurase activity, provides the sulfur that is 
subsequently incorporated into Fe-S clusters by assembler machinery comprising 
of the iscUA-hscBA-fdx gene products. The results presented here indicate 
crucial roles for IscU, HscB, HscA, and Fdx as central components of the 
assembler machinery and also provide evidence for interactions among them.

IscR (iron-sulfur cluster regulator) is encoded by an ORF located immediately 
upstream of genes coding for the Escherichia coli Fe-S cluster assembly 
proteins, IscS, IscU, and IscA. IscR shares amino acid similarity with MarA, a 
member of the MarA/SoxS/Rob family of transcription factors. In this study, we 
found that IscR functions as a repressor of the iscRSUA operon, because strains 
deleted for iscR have increased expression of this operon. In addition, in vitro 
transcription reactions established a direct role for IscR in repression of the 
iscR promoter. Analysis of IscR by electron paramagnetic resonance showed that 
the anaerobically isolated protein contains a [2Fe-2S](1+) cluster. The Fe-S 
cluster appears to be important for IscR function, because repression of iscR 
expression is significantly reduced in strains containing null mutations of the 
Fe-S cluster assembly genes iscS or hscA. The finding that IscR activity is 
decreased in strain backgrounds in which Fe-S cluster assembly is impaired 
suggests that this protein may be part of a novel autoregulatory mechanism that 
senses the Fe-S cluster assembly status of cells.

CsrA of Escherichia coli is an RNA-binding protein that globally regulates a 
wide variety of cellular processes and behaviors, including carbon metabolism, 
motility, biofilm formation, and the stringent response. CsrB and CsrC are small 
RNAs (sRNAs) that sequester CsrA, thereby preventing CsrA-mRNA interaction. RpoE 
(σE) is the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor of E. coli Previous 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies identified rpoE mRNA as a CsrA target. Here, we 
explored the regulation of rpoE by CsrA and found that CsrA represses rpoE 
translation. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified 
three CsrA binding sites in the rpoE leader transcript, one of which overlaps 
the rpoE Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, while another overlaps the rpoE 
translation initiation codon. Coupled in vitro transcription-translation 
experiments showed that CsrA represses rpoE translation by binding to these 
sites. We further demonstrate that σE indirectly activates the transcription of 
csrB and csrC, leading to increased sequestration of CsrA, such that repression 
of rpoE by CsrA is reduced. We propose that the Csr system fine-tunes the 
σE-dependent cell envelope stress response. We also identified a 51-amino-acid 
coding sequence whose stop codon overlaps the rpoE start codon and demonstrate 
that rpoE is translationally coupled with this upstream open reading frame 
(ORF51). The loss of coupling reduces rpoE translation by more than 50%. 
Identification of a translationally coupled ORF upstream of rpoE suggests that 
this previously unannotated protein may participate in the cell envelope stress 
response. In keeping with existing nomenclature, we named ORF51 rseD, resulting 
in an operon arrangement of rseD-rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC IMPORTANCE CsrA 
posttranscriptionally represses genes required for bacterial stress responses, 
including the stringent response, catabolite repression, and the RpoS 
(σS)-mediated general stress response. We show that CsrA represses the 
translation of rpoE, encoding the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor, 
and that σE indirectly activates the transcription of csrB and csrC, resulting 
in reciprocal regulation of these two global regulatory systems. These findings 
suggest that extracytoplasmic stress leads to derepression of rpoE translation 
by CsrA, and CsrA-mediated repression helps reset RpoE abundance to prestress 
levels once envelope damage is repaired. The discovery of an ORF, rseD, 
translationally coupled with rpoE adds further complexity to translational 
control of rpoE.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

Dissection of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis in Escherichia coli: roles of RpoE 
regulators RseA, RseB and periplasmic folding catalyst PpiD.

University, Ube, Japan.

To understand the mechanism of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis, we examined the 
consequences of deletion derivatives of rpoE regulators rseA, rseB and rseC on 
sigma(E) transcription, on levels of free versus membrane-bound sigma(E) and on 
OMP-biogenesis limiting factor(s) that could impact cell lysis. RT-PCR showed 
that individual nonpolar DeltarseA and DeltarseB increased the rpoE expression 
to varying extents, with pronounced induction in DeltarseA. Significantly the 
ratio of soluble (free) versus membrane-bound form of RpoE increased in 
DeltarseA, however without increase of its total amount, unraveling furthermore 
complexity in RpoE regulation. Significant characteristics of cell lysis, 
accompanied by a severe reduction in the levels of periplasmic OMP-folding 
factor (PpiD), were observed in DeltarseA. The cell-lysis phenotype of DeltarseA 
was suppressed by either rseA or ppiD plasmids, but neither by rseB nor by rseC 
clones. However, the cell lysis of the wild-type strain was almost completely 
repressed not only by the rseA clone but also by the rseB clone, suggesting RseB 
might be limiting in vivo. Thus, increase in the ratio of free sigma(E) in rseA 
mutants with a concomitant reduction in PpiD levels can account for 
sigma(E)-dependent lysis in concert with a potential role of small RNAs on the 
lysis process.

The rpoE gene encoding an RNA polymerase sigmaE subunit was isolated from a 
gamma-phage library of the deep-sea piezophilic and psychrophilic bacterium 
Shewanella violacea strain DSS12. Structual analysis showed that the gene 
organization of the fragment containing S. violacearpoE was the l-aspartate 
oxidase-coding gene, rpoE, rseA, rseB and rseC in that order, the same as in the 
case of Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Escherichia coli K-12. The cloned gene, 
576 bp in length, was found to encode a protein consisting of 192 amino acid 
residues with a molecular mass of 21,806 Da. Amino acid alignment of the RpoE 
protein showed that the functional domains responsible for DNA recognition, DNA 
melting, core binding, and RseA interaction were highly conserved. We purified 
hexahistidine-fused RpoE protein by constructing an overexpression plasmid. 
Core-binding analysis revealed that the cloned RpoE protein has the ability to 
bind with core RNA polymerase as a sigma factor.

The sigmaE-mediated response to extracytoplasmic stress in Escherichia coli is 
transduced by RseA and RseB, two negative regulators of sigmaE.

(1)Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 53706, USA.

The extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli is controlled by the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma(E). sigma(E) activity is uniquely induced by the 
accumulation of outer membrane protein precursors in the periplasmic space, and 
leads to the increased production of several proteins, including the periplasmic 
protease DegP, that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular 
integrity under stress conditions. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that 
sigma(E) activity is under the control of three genes, rseABC (for regulator of 
sigma E), encoded immediately downstream of the sigma factor. Deletion of rseA 
leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity. RseA is predicted to be an 
inner membrane protein, and the purified cytoplasmic domain binds to and 
inhibits sigma(E)-directed transcription in vitro, indicating that RseA acts as 
an anti-sigma factor. Deletion of rseB leads to a slight induction of sigma(E), 
indicating that RseB is also a negative regulator of sigma(E). RseB is a 
periplasmic protein and was found to co-purify with the periplasmic domain of 
RseA, indicating that RseB probably exerts negative activity on sigma(E) through 
RseA. Deletion of rseC, in contrast, has no effect on sigma(E) activity under 
steady-state conditions. Under induction conditions, strains lacking RseB and/or 
C show wild-type induction of sigma(E) activity, indicating either the presence 
of multiple pathways regulating sigma(E) activity, or the ability of RseA alone 
to both sense and transmit information to sigma(E).

Modulation of the Escherichia coli sigmaE (RpoE) heat-shock transcription-factor 
activity by the RseA, RseB and RseC proteins.

The sigma(E) (RpoE) transcription factor of Escherichia coli regulates the 
expression of genes whose products are devoted to extracytoplasmic activities. 
The sigma(E) regulon is induced upon misfolding of proteins in the periplasm or 
the outer membrane. Similar to other alternative sigma factors, the activity of 
sigma(E) is tightly regulated in E. coli. We have previously shown that sigma(E) 
is positively autoregulated at the transcriptional level. DNA sequencing, 
coupled with transcriptional analyses, have shown that sigma(E) is encoded by 
the first gene of a four-gene operon. The second gene of this operon, rseA, 
encodes an anti-sigma(E) activity. This was demonstrated at both the genetic and 
biochemical levels. For example, mutations in rseA constitutively increase 
sigma(E) activity. Consistent with this, overproduction of RseA leads to an 
inhibitory effect on sigma(E) activity. Topological analysis of RseA suggests 
the existence of one transmembrane domain, with the N-terminal part localized in 
the cytoplasm. Overproduction of this N-terminal domain alone was shown to 
inhibit sigma(E) activity. These observations were confirmed in vitro, because 
either purified RseA or only its purified N-terminal domain inhibited 
transcription from Esigma(E)-dependent promoters. Furthermore, RseA and sigma(E) 
co-purify, and can be co-immunoprecipitated, and chemically cross-linked. The 
sigma(E) activity is further modulated by the products of the remaining genes in 
this operon, rseB and rseC. RseB is a periplasmic protein, which negatively 
regulates sigma(E) activity and specifically interacts with the C-terminal 
periplasmic domain of RseA. In contrast, RseC is an inner membrane protein that 
positively modulates sigma(E) activity. Most of these protein-protein 
interactions were verified in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system.

CsrA of Escherichia coli is an RNA-binding protein that globally regulates a 
wide variety of cellular processes and behaviors, including carbon metabolism, 
motility, biofilm formation, and the stringent response. CsrB and CsrC are small 
RNAs (sRNAs) that sequester CsrA, thereby preventing CsrA-mRNA interaction. RpoE 
(σE) is the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor of E. coli Previous 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies identified rpoE mRNA as a CsrA target. Here, we 
explored the regulation of rpoE by CsrA and found that CsrA represses rpoE 
translation. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified 
three CsrA binding sites in the rpoE leader transcript, one of which overlaps 
the rpoE Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, while another overlaps the rpoE 
translation initiation codon. Coupled in vitro transcription-translation 
experiments showed that CsrA represses rpoE translation by binding to these 
sites. We further demonstrate that σE indirectly activates the transcription of 
csrB and csrC, leading to increased sequestration of CsrA, such that repression 
of rpoE by CsrA is reduced. We propose that the Csr system fine-tunes the 
σE-dependent cell envelope stress response. We also identified a 51-amino-acid 
coding sequence whose stop codon overlaps the rpoE start codon and demonstrate 
that rpoE is translationally coupled with this upstream open reading frame 
(ORF51). The loss of coupling reduces rpoE translation by more than 50%. 
Identification of a translationally coupled ORF upstream of rpoE suggests that 
this previously unannotated protein may participate in the cell envelope stress 
response. In keeping with existing nomenclature, we named ORF51 rseD, resulting 
in an operon arrangement of rseD-rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC IMPORTANCE CsrA 
posttranscriptionally represses genes required for bacterial stress responses, 
including the stringent response, catabolite repression, and the RpoS 
(σS)-mediated general stress response. We show that CsrA represses the 
translation of rpoE, encoding the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor, 
and that σE indirectly activates the transcription of csrB and csrC, resulting 
in reciprocal regulation of these two global regulatory systems. These findings 
suggest that extracytoplasmic stress leads to derepression of rpoE translation 
by CsrA, and CsrA-mediated repression helps reset RpoE abundance to prestress 
levels once envelope damage is repaired. The discovery of an ORF, rseD, 
translationally coupled with rpoE adds further complexity to translational 
control of rpoE.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

To understand the mechanism of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis, we examined the 
consequences of deletion derivatives of rpoE regulators rseA, rseB and rseC on 
sigma(E) transcription, on levels of free versus membrane-bound sigma(E) and on 
OMP-biogenesis limiting factor(s) that could impact cell lysis. RT-PCR showed 
that individual nonpolar DeltarseA and DeltarseB increased the rpoE expression 
to varying extents, with pronounced induction in DeltarseA. Significantly the 
ratio of soluble (free) versus membrane-bound form of RpoE increased in 
DeltarseA, however without increase of its total amount, unraveling furthermore 
complexity in RpoE regulation. Significant characteristics of cell lysis, 
accompanied by a severe reduction in the levels of periplasmic OMP-folding 
factor (PpiD), were observed in DeltarseA. The cell-lysis phenotype of DeltarseA 
was suppressed by either rseA or ppiD plasmids, but neither by rseB nor by rseC 
clones. However, the cell lysis of the wild-type strain was almost completely 
repressed not only by the rseA clone but also by the rseB clone, suggesting RseB 
might be limiting in vivo. Thus, increase in the ratio of free sigma(E) in rseA 
mutants with a concomitant reduction in PpiD levels can account for 
sigma(E)-dependent lysis in concert with a potential role of small RNAs on the 
lysis process.

The R1 conjugative plasmid increases Escherichia coli biofilm formation through 
an envelope stress response.

Differential gene expression in biofilm cells suggests that adding the 
derepressed conjugative plasmid R1drd19 increases biofilm formation by affecting 
genes related to envelope stress (rseA and cpxAR), biofilm formation (bssR and 
cstA), energy production (glpDFK), acid resistance (gadABCEX and hdeABD), and 
cell motility (csgBEFG, yehCD, yadC, and yfcV); genes encoding outer membrane 
proteins (ompACF), phage shock proteins (pspABCDE), and cold shock proteins 
(cspACDEG); and phage-related genes. To investigate the link between the 
identified genes and biofilm formation upon the addition of R1drd19, 40 isogenic 
mutants were classified according to their different biofilm formation 
phenotypes. Cells with class I mutations (those in rseA, bssR, cpxA, and ompA) 
exhibited no difference from the wild-type strain in biofilm formation and no 
increase in biofilm formation upon the addition of R1drd19. Cells with class II 
mutations (those in gatC, yagI, ompC, cspA, pspD, pspB, ymgB, gadC, pspC, ymgA, 
slp, cpxP, cpxR, cstA, rseC, ompF, and yqjD) displayed increased biofilm 
formation compared to the wild-type strain but decreased biofilm formation upon 
the addition of R1drd19. Class III mutants showed increased biofilm formation 
compared to the wild-type strain and increased biofilm formation upon the 
addition of R1drd19. Cells with class IV mutations displayed increased biofilm 
formation compared to the wild-type strain but little difference upon the 
addition of R1drd19, and class V mutants exhibited no difference from the 
wild-type strain but increased biofilm formation upon the addition of R1drd19. 
Therefore, proteins encoded by the genes corresponding to the class I mutant 
phenotype are involved in R1drd19-promoted biofilm formation, primarily through 
their impact on cell motility. We hypothesize that the pili formed upon the 
addition of the conjugative plasmid disrupt the membrane (induce ompA) and 
activate the two-component system CpxAR as well as the other envelope stress 
response system, RseA-sigma(E), both of which, along with BssR, play a key role 
in bacterial biofilm formation.

The rpoE gene encoding an RNA polymerase sigmaE subunit was isolated from a 
gamma-phage library of the deep-sea piezophilic and psychrophilic bacterium 
Shewanella violacea strain DSS12. Structual analysis showed that the gene 
organization of the fragment containing S. violacearpoE was the l-aspartate 
oxidase-coding gene, rpoE, rseA, rseB and rseC in that order, the same as in the 
case of Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Escherichia coli K-12. The cloned gene, 
576 bp in length, was found to encode a protein consisting of 192 amino acid 
residues with a molecular mass of 21,806 Da. Amino acid alignment of the RpoE 
protein showed that the functional domains responsible for DNA recognition, DNA 
melting, core binding, and RseA interaction were highly conserved. We purified 
hexahistidine-fused RpoE protein by constructing an overexpression plasmid. 
Core-binding analysis revealed that the cloned RpoE protein has the ability to 
bind with core RNA polymerase as a sigma factor.

The sigmaE-mediated response to extracytoplasmic stress in Escherichia coli is 
transduced by RseA and RseB, two negative regulators of sigmaE.

De Las Peñas A(1), Connolly L, Gross CA.

(1)Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 53706, USA.

The extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli is controlled by the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma(E). sigma(E) activity is uniquely induced by the 
accumulation of outer membrane protein precursors in the periplasmic space, and 
leads to the increased production of several proteins, including the periplasmic 
protease DegP, that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular 
integrity under stress conditions. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that 
sigma(E) activity is under the control of three genes, rseABC (for regulator of 
sigma E), encoded immediately downstream of the sigma factor. Deletion of rseA 
leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity. RseA is predicted to be an 
inner membrane protein, and the purified cytoplasmic domain binds to and 
inhibits sigma(E)-directed transcription in vitro, indicating that RseA acts as 
an anti-sigma factor. Deletion of rseB leads to a slight induction of sigma(E), 
indicating that RseB is also a negative regulator of sigma(E). RseB is a 
periplasmic protein and was found to co-purify with the periplasmic domain of 
RseA, indicating that RseB probably exerts negative activity on sigma(E) through 
RseA. Deletion of rseC, in contrast, has no effect on sigma(E) activity under 
steady-state conditions. Under induction conditions, strains lacking RseB and/or 
C show wild-type induction of sigma(E) activity, indicating either the presence 
of multiple pathways regulating sigma(E) activity, or the ability of RseA alone 
to both sense and transmit information to sigma(E).

Modulation of the Escherichia coli sigmaE (RpoE) heat-shock transcription-factor 
activity by the RseA, RseB and RseC proteins.

The sigma(E) (RpoE) transcription factor of Escherichia coli regulates the 
expression of genes whose products are devoted to extracytoplasmic activities. 
The sigma(E) regulon is induced upon misfolding of proteins in the periplasm or 
the outer membrane. Similar to other alternative sigma factors, the activity of 
sigma(E) is tightly regulated in E. coli. We have previously shown that sigma(E) 
is positively autoregulated at the transcriptional level. DNA sequencing, 
coupled with transcriptional analyses, have shown that sigma(E) is encoded by 
the first gene of a four-gene operon. The second gene of this operon, rseA, 
encodes an anti-sigma(E) activity. This was demonstrated at both the genetic and 
biochemical levels. For example, mutations in rseA constitutively increase 
sigma(E) activity. Consistent with this, overproduction of RseA leads to an 
inhibitory effect on sigma(E) activity. Topological analysis of RseA suggests 
the existence of one transmembrane domain, with the N-terminal part localized in 
the cytoplasm. Overproduction of this N-terminal domain alone was shown to 
inhibit sigma(E) activity. These observations were confirmed in vitro, because 
either purified RseA or only its purified N-terminal domain inhibited 
transcription from Esigma(E)-dependent promoters. Furthermore, RseA and sigma(E) 
co-purify, and can be co-immunoprecipitated, and chemically cross-linked. The 
sigma(E) activity is further modulated by the products of the remaining genes in 
this operon, rseB and rseC. RseB is a periplasmic protein, which negatively 
regulates sigma(E) activity and specifically interacts with the C-terminal 
periplasmic domain of RseA. In contrast, RseC is an inner membrane protein that 
positively modulates sigma(E) activity. Most of these protein-protein 
interactions were verified in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system.

case of Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Escherichia coli K-12. The cloned gene, 
576 bp in length, was found to encode a protein consisting of 192 amino acid 
residues with a molecular mass of 21,806 Da. Amino acid alignment of the RpoE 
protein showed that the functional domains responsible for DNA recognition, DNA 
melting, core binding, and RseA interaction were highly conserved. We purified 
hexahistidine-fused RpoE protein by constructing an overexpression plasmid. 
Core-binding analysis revealed that the cloned RpoE protein has the ability to 
bind with core RNA polymerase as a sigma factor.

The soxRS regulon functions in protecting Escherichia coli cells against 
superoxide and nitric oxide. When SoxR is activated by oxidation of its [2Fe-2S] 
cluster, it increases the synthesis of SoxS, which then activates its target 
gene expression. How the oxidized SoxR returns to and is maintained in its 
reduced state has been under question. To identity genes that constitute the 
SoxR-reducing system, we screened an E.coli mutant library carrying a 
chromosomal soxSp::lacZ fusion, for constitutive mutants. Mutations mapped to 
two loci: the rsxABCDGE operon (named for reducer of SoxR) that is highly 
homologous to the rnfABCDGE operon in Rhodobacter capsulatus involved in 
transferring electrons to nitrogenase, and the rseC gene in the rpoE-rseABC 
operon. In-frame deletion of each open reading frame in the rsxABCDGE operon 
produced a similar constitutive phenotype. The double mutation of rsx and rseC 
suggested that rsxABCDGE and rseC gene products act together in the same pathway 
in reducing SoxR. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis of SoxR and 
measurement of re-reduction kinetics support the proposal that rsx and rseC gene 
products constitute a reducing system for SoxR.

The sigma(E) (RpoE) transcription factor of Escherichia coli regulates the 
expression of genes whose products are devoted to extracytoplasmic activities. 
The sigma(E) regulon is induced upon misfolding of proteins in the periplasm or 
the outer membrane. Similar to other alternative sigma factors, the activity of 
sigma(E) is tightly regulated in E. coli. We have previously shown that sigma(E) 
is positively autoregulated at the transcriptional level. DNA sequencing, 
coupled with transcriptional analyses, have shown that sigma(E) is encoded by 
the first gene of a four-gene operon. The second gene of this operon, rseA, 
encodes an anti-sigma(E) activity. This was demonstrated at both the genetic and 
biochemical levels. For example, mutations in rseA constitutively increase 
sigma(E) activity. Consistent with this, overproduction of RseA leads to an 
inhibitory effect on sigma(E) activity. Topological analysis of RseA suggests 
the existence of one transmembrane domain, with the N-terminal part localized in 
the cytoplasm. Overproduction of this N-terminal domain alone was shown to 
inhibit sigma(E) activity. These observations were confirmed in vitro, because 
either purified RseA or only its purified N-terminal domain inhibited 
transcription from Esigma(E)-dependent promoters. Furthermore, RseA and sigma(E) 
co-purify, and can be co-immunoprecipitated, and chemically cross-linked. The 
sigma(E) activity is further modulated by the products of the remaining genes in 
this operon, rseB and rseC. RseB is a periplasmic protein, which negatively 
regulates sigma(E) activity and specifically interacts with the C-terminal 
periplasmic domain of RseA. In contrast, RseC is an inner membrane protein that 
positively modulates sigma(E) activity. Most of these protein-protein 
interactions were verified in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

Dissection of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis in Escherichia coli: roles of RpoE 
regulators RseA, RseB and periplasmic folding catalyst PpiD.

University, Ube, Japan.

To understand the mechanism of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis, we examined the 
consequences of deletion derivatives of rpoE regulators rseA, rseB and rseC on 
sigma(E) transcription, on levels of free versus membrane-bound sigma(E) and on 
OMP-biogenesis limiting factor(s) that could impact cell lysis. RT-PCR showed 
that individual nonpolar DeltarseA and DeltarseB increased the rpoE expression 
to varying extents, with pronounced induction in DeltarseA. Significantly the 
ratio of soluble (free) versus membrane-bound form of RpoE increased in 
DeltarseA, however without increase of its total amount, unraveling furthermore 
complexity in RpoE regulation. Significant characteristics of cell lysis, 
accompanied by a severe reduction in the levels of periplasmic OMP-folding 
factor (PpiD), were observed in DeltarseA. The cell-lysis phenotype of DeltarseA 
was suppressed by either rseA or ppiD plasmids, but neither by rseB nor by rseC 
clones. However, the cell lysis of the wild-type strain was almost completely 
repressed not only by the rseA clone but also by the rseB clone, suggesting RseB 
might be limiting in vivo. Thus, increase in the ratio of free sigma(E) in rseA 
mutants with a concomitant reduction in PpiD levels can account for 
sigma(E)-dependent lysis in concert with a potential role of small RNAs on the 
lysis process.

The rpoE gene encoding an RNA polymerase sigmaE subunit was isolated from a 
gamma-phage library of the deep-sea piezophilic and psychrophilic bacterium 
Shewanella violacea strain DSS12. Structual analysis showed that the gene 
organization of the fragment containing S. violacearpoE was the l-aspartate

case of Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Escherichia coli K-12. The cloned gene, 
576 bp in length, was found to encode a protein consisting of 192 amino acid 
residues with a molecular mass of 21,806 Da. Amino acid alignment of the RpoE 
protein showed that the functional domains responsible for DNA recognition, DNA 
melting, core binding, and RseA interaction were highly conserved. We purified 
hexahistidine-fused RpoE protein by constructing an overexpression plasmid. 
Core-binding analysis revealed that the cloned RpoE protein has the ability to 
bind with core RNA polymerase as a sigma factor.

The sigmaE-mediated response to extracytoplasmic stress in Escherichia coli is 
transduced by RseA and RseB, two negative regulators of sigmaE.

The extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli is controlled by the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma(E). sigma(E) activity is uniquely induced by the 
accumulation of outer membrane protein precursors in the periplasmic space, and 
leads to the increased production of several proteins, including the periplasmic 
protease DegP, that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular 
integrity under stress conditions. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that 
sigma(E) activity is under the control of three genes, rseABC (for regulator of 
sigma E), encoded immediately downstream of the sigma factor. Deletion of rseA 
leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity. RseA is predicted to be an 
inner membrane protein, and the purified cytoplasmic domain binds to and 
inhibits sigma(E)-directed transcription in vitro, indicating that RseA acts as 
an anti-sigma factor. Deletion of rseB leads to a slight induction of sigma(E), 
indicating that RseB is also a negative regulator of sigma(E). RseB is a 
periplasmic protein and was found to co-purify with the periplasmic domain of 
RseA, indicating that RseB probably exerts negative activity on sigma(E) through 
RseA. Deletion of rseC, in contrast, has no effect on sigma(E) activity under 
steady-state conditions. Under induction conditions, strains lacking RseB and/or 
C show wild-type induction of sigma(E) activity, indicating either the presence 
of multiple pathways regulating sigma(E) activity, or the ability of RseA alone 
to both sense and transmit information to sigma(E).
