A plasmid with the galK gene under control of the promoter of the mannitol 
utilization genes (mtl) from Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 50106 was constructed 
to isolate the mtl regulatory gene. An Escherichia coli galK- mtl- strain with 
this plasmid was used to screen a genomic library of P. fluorescens for the 
presence of the regulatory gene by plating on McConkey agar plates supplemented 
with galactose and mannitol. Clones carrying the regulatory gene were isolated 
and by complemention assays, deletion analysis and DNA sequencing an open 
reading frame (mtlR) of 906nt identified encoding the regulator. The deduced 
protein MtlR with a calculated molecular mass of 34.7kDa showed a low overall 
similarity to several other regulatory proteins of the XylS/AraC family. When 
mtlR was cloned and expressed in E. coli, the protein was produced as inclusion 
bodies. Complete denaturation followed by subsequent slow refolding led to low 
amounts of active protein. The activity was shown in gel mobility shift assays 
by binding of MtlR to a DNA fragment containing the promoter/operator region of 
the P. fluorescens mtl genes.

Illinois, Chicago 60680.

The Escherichia coli araFGH operon codes for proteins involved in the 
L-arabinose high-affinity transport system. Transcriptional regulation of the 
operon was studied by creating point mutations and deletions in the control 
region cloned into a GalK expression vector. The transcription start site was 
confirmed by RNA sequencing of transcripts. The sequences essential for 
polymerase function were localized by deletions and point mutations. 
Surprisingly, only a weak -10 consensus sequence, and no -35 sequence is 
required. Mutation of a guanosine at position -12 greatly reduced promoter 
activity, which suggests important polymerase interactions with DNA between the 
usual -10 and -35 positions. A double mutation toward the consensus in the -10 
region was required to create a promoter capable of significant AraC-independent 
transcription. These results show that the araFGH promoter structure is similar 
to that of the galP1 promoter and is substantially different from that of the 
araBAD promoter. The effects of 11 mutations within the DNA region thought to 
bind the cyclic AMP receptor protein correlate well with the CRP consensus 
binding sequence and confirm that this region is responsible for cyclic AMP 
regulation. Deletion of the AraC binding site nearest the promoter, araFG1, 
eliminates arabinose regulation, whereas deletion of the upstream AraC binding 
site, araFG2, has only a slight effect on promoter activity.

The Rob protein of Escherichia coli is a member of the AraC-XylS family of 
prokaryotic transcriptional regulators and is expressed constitutively. Deletion 
of the rob gene increases susceptibility to organic solvents, while 
overexpression of Rob increases tolerance to organic solvents and resistance to 
a variety of antibiotics and to the superoxide-generating compound phenazine 
methosulfate. To determine whether constitutive levels of Rob regulate basal 
gene expression, we performed a MudJ transposon screen in a rob deletion mutant 
containing a plasmid that allows for controlled rob gene expression. We 
identified eight genes and confirmed that seven are transcriptionally activated 
by normal expression of Rob from the chromosomal rob gene (inaA, marR, aslB, 
ybaO, mdlA, yfhD, and ybiS). One gene, galT, was repressed by Rob. We also 
demonstrated by Northern analysis that basal expression of micF is significantly 
higher in wild-type E. coli than in a rob deletion mutant. Rob binding to the 
promoter regions of most of these genes was substantiated in electrophoretic 
mobility shift assays. However, Mu insertions in individual Rob-regulated genes 
did not affect solvent sensitivity. This phenotype may depend on changes in the 
expression of several of these Rob-regulated genes or on other genes that were 
not identified. Rob clearly affects the basal expression of genes with a broad 
range of functions, including antibiotic resistance, acid adaptation, carbon 
metabolism, cell wall synthesis, central intermediary metabolism, and transport. 
The magnitudes of Rob's effects are modest, however, and the protein may thus 
play a role as a general transcription cofactor.

YqhC regulates transcription of the adjacent Escherichia coli genes yqhD and 
dkgA that are involved in furfural tolerance.

Previous results have demonstrated that the silencing of adjacent genes encoding 
NADPH-dependent furfural oxidoreductases (yqhD dkgA) is responsible for 
increased furfural tolerance in an E. coli strain EMFR9 [Miller et al., Appl 
Environ Microbiol 75:4315-4323, 2009]. This gene silencing is now reported to 
result from the spontaneous insertion of an IS10 into the coding region of yqhC, 
an upstream gene. YqhC shares homology with transcriptional regulators belonging 
to the AraC/XylS family and was shown to act as a positive regulator of the 
adjacent operon encoding YqhD and DkgA. Regulation was demonstrated by 
constructing a chromosomal deletion of yqhC, a firefly luciferase reporter 
plasmid for yqhC, and by a direct comparison of furfural resistance and 
NADPH-dependent furfural reductase activity. Closely related bacteria contain 
yqhC, yqhD, and dkgA orthologs in the same arrangement as in E. coli LY180. 
Orthologs of yqhC are also present in more distantly related Gram-negative 
bacteria. Disruption of yqhC offers a useful approach to increase furfural 
tolerance in bacteria.

Transcription-generated DNA supercoiling plays a decisive role in a promoter 
relay mechanism for the coordinated expression of genes in the Salmonella 
typhimurium ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster. A similar mechanism also operates 
to control expression of the genes in the Escherichia coli ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD 
gene cluster. However, the mechanism underlying the DNA supercoiling effect 
remained elusive. A bacterial gene silencer AT8 was found to be important for 
the repression state of the leuO gene as part of the promoter relay mechanism. 
In this communication, we demonstrated that the gene silencer AT8 is a 
nucleation site for recruiting histone-like nucleoid structuring protein to form 
a cis-spreading nucleoprotein filament that is responsible for silencing of the 
leuO gene. With a DNA geometric similarity rather than a DNA sequence 
specificity, the E. coli gene silencer EAT6 was capable of replacing the 
histone-like nucleoid structuring protein nucleation function of the S. 
typhimurium gene silencer AT8 for the leuO gene silencing. The 
interchangeability between DNA geometrical elements for supporting the silencing 
activity in the region is consistent with a previous finding that a neighboring 
transcription activity determines the outcome of the gene silencing activity. 
The geometric requirement, which was revealed for this silencing activity, 
explains the decisive role of transcription-generated DNA supercoiling found in 
the promoter relay mechanism.

Lipoic acid is a covalently-bound enzyme cofactor required for central 
metabolism all three domains of life. In the last 20 years the pathway of lipoic 
acid synthesis and metabolism has been established in Escherichia coli. 
Expression of the genes of the lipoic acid biosynthesis pathway was believed to 
be constitutive. However, in 2010 Kaleta and coworkers (BMC Syst. Biol. 4:116) 
predicted a binding site for the pyruvate dehydrogenase operon repressor, PdhR 
(referred to lipA site 1) upstream of lipA, the gene encoding lipoic acid 
synthase and concluded that PdhR regulates lipA transcription. We report in vivo 
and in vitro evidence that lipA is not controlled by PdhR and that the putative 
regulatory site deduced by the prior workers is nonfunctional and 
physiologically irrelevant. E. coli PdhR was purified to homogeneity and used 
for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The lipA site 1 of Kaleta and 
coworkers failed to bind PdhR. The binding detected by these workers is due to 
another site (lipA site 3) located far upstream of the lipA promoter. Relative 
to the canonical PdhR binding site lipA site 3 is a half-palindrome and as 
expected had only weak PdhR binding ability. Manipulation of lipA site 3 to 
construct a palindrome gave significantly enhanced PdhR binding affinity. The 
native lipA promoter and the version carrying the artificial lipA3 palindrome 
were transcriptionally fused to a LacZ reporter gene to directly assay lipA 
expression. Deletion of pdhR gave no significant change in lipA promoter-driven 
β-galactosidase activity with either the native or constructed palindrome 
upstream sequences, indicating that PdhR plays no physiological role in 
regulation of lipA expression.

Integrative inference of gene-regulatory networks in Escherichia coli using 
information theoretic concepts and sequence analysis.

BACKGROUND: Although Escherichia coli is one of the best studied model 
organisms, a comprehensive understanding of its gene regulation is not yet 
achieved. There exist many approaches to reconstruct regulatory interaction 
networks from gene expression experiments. Mutual information based approaches 
are most useful for large-scale network inference.
RESULTS: We used a three-step approach in which we combined gene regulatory 
network inference based on directed information (DTI) and sequence analysis. DTI 
values were calculated on a set of gene expression profiles from 19 time course 
experiments extracted from the Many Microbes Microarray Database. Focusing on 
influences between pairs of genes in which one partner encodes a transcription 
factor (TF) we derived a network which contains 878 TF - gene interactions of 
which 166 are known according to RegulonDB. Afterward, we selected a subset of 
109 interactions that could be confirmed by the presence of a phylogenetically 
conserved binding site of the respective regulator. By this second step, the 
fraction of known interactions increased from 19% to 60%. In the last step, we 
checked the 44 of the 109 interactions not yet included in RegulonDB for 
functional relationships between the regulator and the target and, thus, 
obtained ten TF - target gene interactions. Five of them concern the regulator 
LexA and have already been reported in the literature. The remaining five 
influences describe regulations by Fis (with two novel targets), PhdR, PhoP, and 
KdgR. For the validation of our approach, one of them, the regulation of lipoate 
synthase (LipA) by the pyruvate-sensing pyruvate dehydrogenate repressor (PdhR), 
was experimentally checked and confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS: We predicted a set of five novel TF - target gene interactions in 
E. coli. One of them, the regulation of lipA by the transcriptional regulator 
PdhR was validated experimentally. Furthermore, we developed DTInfer, a new 
R-package for the inference of gene-regulatory networks from microarrays using 
directed information.

A Lactococcus lactis gene encodes a membrane protein with putative ATPase 
activity that is homologous to the essential Escherichia coli ftsH gene product.

A gene, encoding a protein homologous to an essential Escherichia coli protein, 
FtsH, was identified adjacent to the hpt gene and the trnA operon in the 
Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis. The deduced amino acid sequence of 
the gene product showed full-length similarity to FtsH of E. coli, Yme1p of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a conserved region found in a new family of 
putative ATPases. In-frame fusions of L. lactis ftsH and phoA1 in E. coli, and 
immunodetection of the L. lactis FtsH protein in cell fractions using anti-E. 
coli FtsH serum showed that L. lactis ftsH was expressed and encodes a membrane 
protein. When contained on a high copy number plasmid, the L. lactis ftsH gene 
complemented the lethality of a delta ftsH3::kan mutation in E. coli at 37 
degrees C and below, indicating that the L. lactis ftsH gene can functionally 
replace the E. coli ftsH gene to some extent. The resulting E. coli strain 
showed temperature sensitivity and salt sensitivity. A L. lactis mutant with an 
insertion into ftsH was salt-, heat- and cold-sensitive. These results suggest 
that FtsH is somehow involved in stress responses. Southern hybridization 
analysis indicated that genes homologous to ftsH of L. lactis were also present 
in Bacillus subtilis, and several Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc species, 
suggesting high conservation of ftsH in bacterial species.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

The sigmaE-mediated response to extracytoplasmic stress in Escherichia coli is 
transduced by RseA and RseB, two negative regulators of sigmaE.

De Las Peñas A(1), Connolly L, Gross CA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 53706, USA.

The extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli is controlled by the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma(E). sigma(E) activity is uniquely induced by the 
accumulation of outer membrane protein precursors in the periplasmic space, and 
leads to the increased production of several proteins, including the periplasmic 
protease DegP, that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular 
integrity under stress conditions. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that 
sigma(E) activity is under the control of three genes, rseABC (for regulator of 
sigma E), encoded immediately downstream of the sigma factor. Deletion of rseA 
leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity. RseA is predicted to be an 
inner membrane protein, and the purified cytoplasmic domain binds to and 
inhibits sigma(E)-directed transcription in vitro, indicating that RseA acts as 
an anti-sigma factor. Deletion of rseB leads to a slight induction of sigma(E), 
indicating that RseB is also a negative regulator of sigma(E). RseB is a 
periplasmic protein and was found to co-purify with the periplasmic domain of 
RseA, indicating that RseB probably exerts negative activity on sigma(E) through 
RseA. Deletion of rseC, in contrast, has no effect on sigma(E) activity under 
steady-state conditions. Under induction conditions, strains lacking RseB and/or 
C show wild-type induction of sigma(E) activity, indicating either the presence 
of multiple pathways regulating sigma(E) activity, or the ability of RseA alone 
to both sense and transmit information to sigma(E).

RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

The sigmaE-mediated response to extracytoplasmic stress in Escherichia coli is 
transduced by RseA and RseB, two negative regulators of sigmaE.

The extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli is controlled by the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma(E). sigma(E) activity is uniquely induced by the 
accumulation of outer membrane protein precursors in the periplasmic space, and 
leads to the increased production of several proteins, including the periplasmic 
protease DegP, that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular 
integrity under stress conditions. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that 
sigma(E) activity is under the control of three genes, rseABC (for regulator of 
sigma E), encoded immediately downstream of the sigma factor. Deletion of rseA 
leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity. RseA is predicted to be an 
inner membrane protein, and the purified cytoplasmic domain binds to and 
inhibits sigma(E)-directed transcription in vitro, indicating that RseA acts as 
an anti-sigma factor. Deletion of rseB leads to a slight induction of sigma(E), 
indicating that RseB is also a negative regulator of sigma(E). RseB is a 
periplasmic protein and was found to co-purify with the periplasmic domain of 
RseA, indicating that RseB probably exerts negative activity on sigma(E) through 
RseA. Deletion of rseC, in contrast, has no effect on sigma(E) activity under 
steady-state conditions. Under induction conditions, strains lacking RseB and/or 
C show wild-type induction of sigma(E) activity, indicating either the presence 
of multiple pathways regulating sigma(E) activity, or the ability of RseA alone 
to both sense and transmit information to sigma(E).

OmpF Downregulation Mediated by Sigma E or OmpR Activation Confers Cefalexin 
Resistance in Escherichia coli in the Absence of Acquired β-Lactamases.

Cefalexin is a widely used first-generation cephalosporin, and resistance in 
Escherichia coli is caused by extended-spectrum (e.g., CTX-M) and AmpC 
β-lactamase production and therefore frequently coincides with third-generation 
cephalosporin resistance. However, we have recently identified large numbers of 
E. coli isolates from human infections, and from cattle, where cefalexin 
resistance is not β-lactamase mediated. Here, we show, by studying 
laboratory-selected mutants, clinical isolates, and isolates from cattle, that 
OmpF porin disruption or downregulation is a major cause of cefalexin resistance 
in E. coli. Importantly, we identify multiple regulatory mutations that cause 
OmpF downregulation. In addition to mutation of ompR, already known to 
downregulate OmpF and OmpC porin production, we find that rseA mutation, which 
strongly activates the sigma E regulon, greatly increases DegP production, which 
degrades OmpF, OmpC, and OmpA. Furthermore, we reveal that mutations affecting 
lipopolysaccharide structure, exemplified by the loss of GmhB, essential for 
lipopolysaccharide heptosylation, also modestly activate DegP production, 
resulting in OmpF degradation. Remarkably, given the critical importance 
attached to such systems for normal E. coli physiology, we find evidence for 
DegP-mediated OmpF downregulation and gmhB and rseA loss-of-function mutation in 
E. coli isolates derived from human infections. Finally, we show that these 
regulatory mutations enhance the ability of group 1 CTX-M β-lactamase to confer 
reduced carbapenem susceptibility, particularly those mutations that cause OmpC 
in addition to OmpF downregulation.

In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic protease DegP plays a critical role in 
degrading misfolded outer membrane proteins (OMPs). Consequently, mutants 
lacking DegP display a temperature-sensitive growth defect, presumably due to 
the toxic accumulation of misfolded OMPs. The Tol-Pal complex plays a poorly 
defined but an important role in envelope biogenesis, since mutants defective in 
this complex display a classical periplasmic leakage phenotype. Double mutants 
lacking DegP and an intact Tol-Pal complex display exaggerated 
temperature-sensitive growth defects and the leaky phenotype. Two revertants 
that overcome the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype carry missense 
mutations in the degS gene, resulting in D102V and D320A substitutions. D320 and 
E317 of the PDZ domain of DegS make salt bridges with R178 of DegS's protease 
domain to keep the protease in the inactive state. However, weakening of the 
tripartite interactions by D320A increases DegS's basal protease activity. 
Although the D102V substitution is as effective as D320A in suppressing the 
temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, the molecular mechanism behind its 
effect on DegS's protease activity is unclear. Our data suggest that the two 
DegS variants modestly activate RseA-controlled, σE-mediated envelope stress 
response pathway and elevate periplasmic protease activity to restore envelope 
homeostasis. Based on the release of a cytoplasmic enzyme in the culture 
supernatant, we conclude that the conditional lethal phenotype of ΔtolB ΔdegP 
mutants stems from a grossly destabilized envelope structure that causes 
excessive cell lysis. Together, the data point to a critical role for 
periplasmic proteases when the Tol-Pal complex-mediated envelope structure 
and/or functions are compromised.IMPORTANCE The Tol-Pal complex plays a poorly 
defined role in envelope biogenesis. The data presented here show that DegP's 
periplasmic protease activity becomes crucial in mutants lacking the intact 
Tol-Pal complex, but this requirement can be circumvented by suppressor 
mutations that activate the basal protease activity of a regulatory protease, 
DegS. These observations point to a critical role for periplasmic proteases when 
Tol-Pal-mediated envelope structure and/or functions are perturbed.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in

Reversal of the ΔdegP phenotypes by a novel rpoE allele of Escherichia coli.

RseA sequesters RpoE (σ(E)) to the inner membrane of Escherichia coli when 
envelope stress is low. Elevated envelope stress triggers RseA cleavage by the 
sequential action of two membrane proteases, DegS and RseP, releasing σ(E) to 
activate an envelope stress reducing pathway. Revertants of a ΔdegP ΔbamB 
strain, which fails to grow at 37°C due to high envelope stress, harbored 
mutations in the rseA and rpoE genes. Null and missense rseA mutations 
constitutively hyper-activated the σ(E) regulon and significantly reduced the 
major outer membrane protein (OMP) levels. In contrast, a novel rpoE allele, 
rpoE3, resulting from the partial duplication of the rpoE gene, increased σ(E) 
levels greater than that seen in the rseA mutant background but did not reduce 
OMP levels. A σ(E)-dependent RybB::LacZ construct showed only a weak activation 
of the σ(E) pathway by rpoE3. Despite this, rpoE3 fully reversed the growth and 
envelope vesiculation phenotypes of ΔdegP. Interestingly, rpoE3 also brought 
down the modestly activated Cpx envelope stress pathway in the ΔdegP strain to 
the wild type level, showing the complementary nature of the σ(E) and Cpx 
pathways. Through employing a labile mutant periplasmic protein, AcrA(L222Q), it 
was determined that the rpoE3 mutation overcomes the ΔdegP phenotypes, in part, 
by activating a σ(E)-dependent proteolytic pathway. Our data suggest that a 
reduction in the OMP levels is not intrinsic to the σ(E)-mediated mechanism of 
lowering envelope stress. They also suggest that under extreme envelope stress, 
a tight homeostasis loop between RseA and σ(E) may partly be responsible for 
cell death, and this loop can be broken by mutations that either lower RseA 
activity or increase σ(E) levels.

The PDZ protease DegS senses mislocalized outer membrane proteins and initiates 
the sigmaE pathway in the bacterial periplasm. This unfolded protein response 
pathway is activated by processing of the anti-sigma factor RseA by DegS and 
other proteases acting downstream of DegS. DegS mediates the rate-limiting step 
of sigma E induction and its activity must be highly specific and tightly 
regulated. While DegS is structurally and biochemically well studied, the 
determinants of its pronounced substrate specificity are unknown. We therefore 
performed swapping experiments by introducing elements of the homologous but 
unspecific PDZ protease DegP. Introduction of loop L2 of DegP into DegS 
converted the enzyme into a non-specific protease, while swapping of PDZ domains 
did not. Therefore, loop L2 of the protease domain is a key determinant of 
substrate specificity. Interestingly, swapping of loop L2 did not affect the 
tight regulation of DegS. In addition, the combined introduction of loop L2 and 
PDZ domain 1 of DegP into DegS converted DegS even further into a DegP-like 
protease. These and other data suggest that homologous enzymes with distinct 
activities and regulatory features can be converted by simple genetic 
modifications.

Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is a method for transducing signals between 
cellular compartments. When protein folding is compromised in the periplasm of 
E. coli, the C termini of outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) bind to the PDZ domains 
of the trimeric DegS protease and activate cleavage of RseA, a transmembrane 
transcriptional regulator. We show here that DegS is an allosteric enzyme. OMP 
binding shifts the equilibrium from a nonfunctional state, in which the active 
sites are unreactive, to the functional proteolytic conformation. 
Crystallographic, biochemical, and mutagenic experiments show that the 
unliganded PDZ domains are inhibitory and suggest that OMP binding per se is 
sufficient to stabilize the relaxed conformation and activate DegS. OMP-induced 
activation and RseA binding are both positively cooperative, allowing 
switch-like behavior of the OMP-DegS-RseA system. Residues involved in the DegS 
allosteric switch are conserved in the DegP/HtrA and HtrA2/Omi families, 
suggesting that many PDZ proteases use a common mechanism of allosteric 
activation.

    Cell. 2003 Apr 4;113(1):1-2.

Transmembrane signaling between intracellular compartments is often controlled 
by regulated proteolysis. Escherichia coli respond to misfolded or unfolded 
outer-membrane porins (OMPs) in the periplasm by inducing sigma(E)-dependent 
transcription of stress genes in the cytoplasm. This process requires a 
proteolytic cascade initiated by the DegS protease, which destroys a 
transmembrane protein (RseA) that normally binds to and inhibits sigma(E). Here, 
we show that peptides ending with OMP-like C-terminal sequences bind the DegS 
PDZ domain, activate DegS cleavage of RseA, and induce sigma(E)-dependent 
transcription. These results suggest that DegS acts as a sensor of envelope 
stress by binding unassembled OMPs. DegS activation involves relief of 
inhibitory interactions between its PDZ and protease domains. Peptide binding to 
inhibitory PDZ domains in proteases related to DegS, including DegP/HtrA, may 
also regulate the degradation of specific substrates by these enzymes.

degS (hhoB) is an essential Escherichia coli gene whose indispensable function

Alba BM(1), Zhong HJ, Pelayo JC, Gross CA.

Francisco, California 94143, USA.

DegS (HhoB), a putative serine protease related to DegP/HtrA, regulates the 
basal and induced activity of the essential Escherichia coli sigma factor sigma 
(E), which is involved in the cellular response to extracytoplasmic stress. DegS 
promotes the destabilization of the sigma (E)-specific anti-sigma factor RseA, 
thereby releasing sigma (E) to direct gene expression. We demonstrate that degS 
is an essential E. coli gene and show that the essential function of DegS is to 
provide the cell with sigma (E) activity. We also show that the putative active 
site of DegS is periplasmic and that DegS requires its N-terminal transmembrane 
domain for its sigma (E)-related function.

Hyperosmotic shock induces the sigma32 and sigmaE stress regulons of Escherichia 
coli.

Bianchi AA(1), Baneyx F.

Author information:

The rise in the levels of sigmaS that accompanies hyperosmotic shock plays an 
important role in Escherichia coli survival by increasing the transcription of 
genes involved in the synthesis and transport of osmoprotectants. To determine 
if other stress regulons collaborate with sigmaS in dealing with high 
osmolality, we used single copy fusions of lacZ to representative promoters 
induced by protein misfolding in the cytoplasm (dnaK and ibp ), extracytoplasmic 
stress [P3rpoH and htrA(degP )] and cold shock (cspA). Both the 
sigma32-dependent, dnaK and ibp, promoters, and the sigmaE-dependent, P3rpoH and 
htrA, promoters were rapidly but transiently induced when mid-exponential phase 
cells were treated with 0.464 M sucrose. The cspA promoter, however, did not 
respond to the same treatment. Overproduction of the cytoplasmic domain of the 
sigmaE anti-sigma factor, RseA, reduced the magnitude of osmotic induction in 
lambdaphi(P3rpoH:lacZ ) lysogens, but had no effect on the activation of the 
dnaK and ibp promoters. Similarly, induction of the dnaK:lacZ and ibp:lacZ 
fusions was not altered in either rpoS or ompR genetic backgrounds. Osmotic 
upshift led to a twofold increase in the enzymatic activity of the lambdaTLF247 
rpoH:lacZ translational fusion whether or not the cells were treated with 
rifampicin, indicating that both heat shock and exposure to high osmolality 
trigger a transient increase in rpoH translation. Our results suggest that the 
sigma32, sigmaE and sigmaS regulons closely co-operate in the managment of 
hyperosmotic stress. Induction of the sigma32 and sigmaE regulons appears to be 
an emergency response required to repair protein misfolding and facilitate the 
proper folding of proteins that are rapidly synthesized following loss of 
turgor, while providing a mechanism to increase the activity of sigmaS, the 
primary stress factor in osmoadaptation.

The HtrA family of serine proteases.

School of Medicine and Dentistry, UK. m.pallen@qmw.ac.uk

HtrA, also known as DegP and probably identical to the Do protease, is a heat 
shock-induced serine protease that is active in the periplasm of Escherichia 
coli. Homologues of HtrA have been described in a wide range of bacteria and in 
eukaryotes. Its chief role is to degrade misfolded proteins in the periplasm. 
Substrate recognition probably involves the recently described PDZ domains in 
the C-terminal half of HtrA and, we suspect, has much in common with the 
substrate recognition system of the tail-specific protease, Prc (which also 
possesses a PDZ domain). The expression of htrA is regulated by a complex set of 
signal transduction pathways, which includes an alternative sigma factor, RpoE, 
an anti-sigma factor, RseA, a two-component regulatory system, CpxRA, and two 
phosphoprotein phosphatases, PrpA and PrpB. Mutations in the htrA genes of 
Salmonella, Brucella and Yersinia cause decreased survival in mice and/or 
macrophages, and htrA mutants can act as vaccines, as cloning hosts and as 
carriers of heterologous antigens.

absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

RseA sequesters RpoE (σ(E)) to the inner membrane of Escherichia coli when 
envelope stress is low. Elevated envelope stress triggers RseA cleavage by the 
sequential action of two membrane proteases, DegS and RseP, releasing σ(E) to 
activate an envelope stress reducing pathway. Revertants of a ΔdegP ΔbamB 
strain, which fails to grow at 37°C due to high envelope stress, harbored 
mutations in the rseA and rpoE genes. Null and missense rseA mutations 
constitutively hyper-activated the σ(E) regulon and significantly reduced the 
major outer membrane protein (OMP) levels. In contrast, a novel rpoE allele, 
rpoE3, resulting from the partial duplication of the rpoE gene, increased σ(E) 
levels greater than that seen in the rseA mutant background but did not reduce 
OMP levels. A σ(E)-dependent RybB::LacZ construct showed only a weak activation 
of the σ(E) pathway by rpoE3. Despite this, rpoE3 fully reversed the growth and 
envelope vesiculation phenotypes of ΔdegP. Interestingly, rpoE3 also brought 
down the modestly activated Cpx envelope stress pathway in the ΔdegP strain to 
the wild type level, showing the complementary nature of the σ(E) and Cpx 
pathways. Through employing a labile mutant periplasmic protein, AcrA(L222Q), it 
was determined that the rpoE3 mutation overcomes the ΔdegP phenotypes, in part, 
by activating a σ(E)-dependent proteolytic pathway. Our data suggest that a 
reduction in the OMP levels is not intrinsic to the σ(E)-mediated mechanism of 
lowering envelope stress. They also suggest that under extreme envelope stress, 
a tight homeostasis loop between RseA and σ(E) may partly be responsible for 
cell death, and this loop can be broken by mutations that either lower RseA 
activity or increase σ(E) levels.

Suppression by enhanced RpoE activity of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of 
a degP ssrA double mutant in Escherichia coli.

SsrA is a small RNA playing a crucial role in trans-translation, which leads to 
rescue of stalled ribosomes on or at the end of mRNA and addition of the 
degradation tag to a growing polypeptide. The lack of SsrA has been shown to 
enhance the temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype of an E. coli strain defective 
in the degP gene, which encodes one of the periplasmic proteases. This severe ts 
phenotype was relieved only partially by an SsrADD variant, which can lead to 
ribosome rescue but adds a protease-resistant tag instead of the degradation 
tag, suggesting that accumulation of polypeptides programmed by truncated mRNAs 
is responsible for growth defect of the ssrA degP mutant. Expression of an 
S210A-mutant DegP protein, which lacks the protease activity but retains the 
chaperone activity, could relieve the ts phenotype of the double mutant, 
suggesting that the chaperone activity but not the protease activity of DegP is 
required for growth of the ssrA-deficient cells at high temperature. 
Overexpression of the rpoE gene, which encodes sigmaE responsible for the 
expression of factors involved in extracellular stress response, also suppressed 
the ts phenotype of the ssrA degP mutant. This suggests that the 
stress-responsing pathway(s) may be involved in the enhancement of ts phenotype 
of degP mutant in the absence of SsrA.

Verapamil, a Ca2+ channel inhibitor acts as a local anesthetic and induces the 
sigma E dependent extra-cytoplasmic stress response in E. coli.

Verapamil is used clinically as a Ca(2+) channel inhibitor for the treatment of 
various disorders such as angina, hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia. Here we 
study the effect of verapamil on the bacterium Escherichia coli. The drug was 
shown to inhibit cell division at growth sub inhibitory concentrations, 
independently of the SOS response. We show verapamil is a membrane active drug, 
with similar effects to dibucaine, a local anesthetic. Thus, both verapamil and 
dibucaine abolish the proton motive force and decrease the intracellular ATP 
concentration. This is accompanied by induction of degP expression, as a result 
of the activation of the RpoE (SigmaE) extra-cytoplasmic stress response, and 
activation of the psp operon. Such effects of verapamil, as a membrane active 
compound, could explain its general toxicity in eukaryotic cells.

Defective O-antigen polymerization in tolA and pal mutants of Escherichia coli 
in response to extracytoplasmic stress.

We have previously shown that the TolA protein is required for the correct 
surface expression of the Escherichia coli O7 antigen lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 
In this work, delta tolA and delta pal mutants of E. coli K-12 W3110 were 
transformed with pMF19 (encoding a rhamnosyltransferase that reconstitutes the 
expression of O16-specific LPS), pWQ5 (encoding the Klebsiella pneumoniae O1 LPS 
gene cluster), or pWQ802 (encoding the genes necessary for the synthesis of 
Salmonella enterica O:54). Both DeltatolA and delta pal mutants exhibited 
reduced surface expression of O16 LPS as compared to parental W3110, but no 
significant differences were observed in the expression of K. pneumoniae O1 LPS 
and S. enterica O:54 LPS. Therefore, TolA and Pal are required for the correct 
surface expression of O antigens that are assembled in a wzy 
(polymerase)-dependent manner (like those of E. coli O7 and O16) but not for O 
antigens assembled by wzy-independent pathways (like K. pneumoniae O1 and S. 
enterica O:54). Furthermore, we show that the reduced surface expression of O16 
LPS in delta tolA and delta pal mutants was associated with a partial defect in 
O-antigen polymerization and it was corrected by complementation with intact 
tolA and pal genes, respectively. Using derivatives of W3110 delta tolA and 
W3110 delta pal containing lacZ reporter fusions to fkpA and degP, we also 
demonstrate that the RpoE-mediated extracytoplasmic stress response is 
upregulated in these mutants. Moreover, an altered O16 polymerization was also 
detected under conditions that stimulate RpoE-mediated extracytoplasmic stress 
responses in tol+ and pal+ genetic backgrounds. A Wzy derivative with an epitope 
tag at the C-terminal end of the protein was stable in all the mutants, ruling 
out stress-mediated proteolysis of Wzy. We conclude that the absence of TolA and 
Pal elicits a sustained extracytoplasmic stress response that in turn reduces 
O-antigen polymerization but does not affect the stability of the Wzy O-antigen 
polymerase.

In Escherichia coli, envelope stress is regulated by the alternative sigma 
factor sigma(E) and the two-component regulatory system CpxRA. Both systems 
overlap in the transcriptional regulation of the htrA gene encoding a protease 
that degrades misfolded proteins in the periplasm. In Yersinia enterocolitica, 
HtrA is important for intracellular survival and full virulence in animal 
models. Here we show that regulation of htrA expression in Y. enterocolitica is 
dependent on CpxR and putatively also on RpoE. However, the stimuli inducing 
both systems were different from E. coli. Most strikingly, we found that 
overproduction of an outer membrane protein, a typical stimulus for the 
induction of htrA expression via RpoE in E. coli, led to the induction of htrA 
expression via the Cpx system in Y. enterocolitica. Interestingly, a Y. 
enterocolitica CpxR mutant strain was not impaired for virulence in a mouse 
model of infection.

The HtrA family of serine proteases.

School of Medicine and Dentistry, UK. m.pallen@qmw.ac.uk

HtrA, also known as DegP and probably identical to the Do protease, is a heat 
shock-induced serine protease that is active in the periplasm of Escherichia 
coli. Homologues of HtrA have been described in a wide range of bacteria and in 
eukaryotes. Its chief role is to degrade misfolded proteins in the periplasm. 
Substrate recognition probably involves the recently described PDZ domains in 
the C-terminal half of HtrA and, we suspect, has much in common with the 
substrate recognition system of the tail-specific protease, Prc (which also 
possesses a PDZ domain). The expression of htrA is regulated by a complex set of 
signal transduction pathways, which includes an alternative sigma factor, RpoE, 
an anti-sigma factor, RseA, a two-component regulatory system, CpxRA, and two 
phosphoprotein phosphatases, PrpA and PrpB. Mutations in the htrA genes of 
Salmonella, Brucella and Yersinia cause decreased survival in mice and/or 
macrophages, and htrA mutants can act as vaccines, as cloning hosts and as 
carriers of heterologous antigens.

In vitro transcription analysis has shown that only RNA polymerase containing an 
alternative sigma subunit, sigma E, activates transcription from one of the rpoH 
promoters and the htrA promoter. The location of the rpoE gene encoding sigma E 
on the Escherichia coli chromosome has recently been established, but no rpoE 
mutant has yet become available for phenotypic testing. We cloned the rpoE gene 
from the lambda-ordered clones of the E. coli genome and confirmed that the 
reconstituted RNA polymerase containing the gene product (E sigma E) can 
transcribe htrA in vitro. We constructed an rpoE-defective strain by gene 
disruption using the cloned rpoE gene. We demonstrate that expression of htrA is 
completely dependent on the rpoE gene in vivo and that the rpoE gene is 
essential for bacterial growth at high temperature.

The rpoE gene encoding the sigma E (sigma 24) heat shock sigma factor of 
Escherichia coli.

Previous work has established that the transcription factor sigma E (sigma 24) 
is necessary for maintaining the induction of the heat shock response of 
Escherichia coli at high temperatures. We have identified the gene encoding 
sigma E using a genetic screen designed to isolate trans-acting mutations that 
abolish expression from either htrA or rpoHP3, two promoters recognized uniquely 
by sigma E-containing RNA polymerase. Such a screen was achieved by transducing 
strains carrying a single copy of either phtrA-lacZ or rpoHP3-lacZ fusions with 
mutagenized bacteriophage P1 lysates and screening for Lac- mutant colonies at 
22 degrees C. Lac- mutants were subsequently tested for inability to grow at 43 
degrees C (Ts- phenotype). Only those Lac- Ts- mutants that were unable to 
accumulate heat shock proteins at 50 degrees C were retained for further 
characterization. In a complementary approach, those genes which when cloned on 
a multicopy plasmid led to higher constitutive expression of the sigma E regulon 
were characterized and mapped. Both approaches identified the same gene, rpoE, 
mapping at 55.5 min on the E.coli genetic map and encoding a polypeptide of 191 
amino acid residues. The wild-type and a mutant rpoE gene products were 
over-expressed and purified. It was found that the purified wild-type sigma E 
protein, when used in in vitro run-off transcription assays in combination with 
core RNA polymerase, was able to direct transcription from the htrA and rpoHP3 
promoters, but not from known sigma 70-dependent promoters. In vivo and in vitro 
analyses of rpoE transcriptional regulation showed that the rpoE gene is 
transcribed from two major promoters, one of which is positively regulated by 
sigma E itself.

Most organisms are exposed to the genotoxic chemical formaldehyde, either from 
endogenous or environmental sources. Therefore, biology has evolved systems to 
perceive and detoxify formaldehyde. The frmRA(B) operon that is present in many 
bacteria represents one such system. The FrmR protein is a transcriptional 
repressor that is specifically inactivated in the presence of formaldehyde, 
permitting expression of the formaldehyde detoxification machinery (FrmA and 
FrmB, when the latter is present). The X-ray structure of the 
formaldehyde-treated Escherichia coli FrmR (EcFrmR) protein reveals the 
formation of methylene bridges that link adjacent Pro2 and Cys35 residues in the 
EcFrmR tetramer. Methylene bridge formation has profound effects on the pattern 
of surface charge of EcFrmR and combined with biochemical/biophysical data 
suggests a mechanistic model for formaldehyde-sensing and derepression of 
frmRA(B) expression in numerous bacterial species.

sensors that respond to cobalt and/or nickel (RcnR, InrS) or copper (CsoR) plus 
CstR, which responds to persulfide, and formaldehyde-responsive FrmR.

responsiveness to Zn(II) and cobalt in vivo Here we establish that the 
allosteric mechanism of FrmR is triggered directly by formaldehyde in vitro 
Sensitivity to formaldehyde requires a cysteine (Cys(35) in FrmR) conserved in 
all DUF156 proteins. A crystal structure of metal- and formaldehyde-sensing 
FrmR(E64H) reveals that an FrmR-specific amino-terminal Pro(2) is proximal to 
Cys(35), and these residues form the deduced formaldehyde-sensing site. Evidence 
is presented that implies that residues spatially close to the conserved 
cysteine tune the sensitivities of DUF156 proteins above or below critical 
thresholds for different effectors, generating the semblance of specificity 
within cells. Relative to FrmR, RcnR is less responsive to formaldehyde in 
vitro, and RcnR does not sense formaldehyde in vivo, but reciprocal mutations 
FrmR(P2S) and RcnR(S2P), respectively, impair and enhance formaldehyde 
reactivity in vitro Formaldehyde detoxification by FrmA requires 
S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione, yet glutathione inhibits formaldehyde detection by 
FrmR in vivo and in vitro Quantifying the number of FrmR molecules per cell and 
modeling formaldehyde modification as a function of [formaldehyde] demonstrates 
that FrmR reactivity is optimized such that FrmR is modified and frmRA is 
derepressed at lower [formaldehyde] than required to generate 
S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione. Expression of FrmA is thereby coordinated with the 
accumulation of its substrate.

Expression of an amber suppressor tRNA should result in read-through of the 326 
open reading frames (ORFs) that terminate with amber stop codons in the 
Escherichia coli genome, including six pseudogenes. Abnormal extension of an ORF 
might alter the activities of the protein and have effects on cellular 
physiology, while suppression of a pseudogene could lead to a gain of function. 
We used oligonucleotide microarrays to determine if any effects were apparent at 
the level of transcription in glucose minimal medium. Surprisingly, only eight 
genes had significantly different expression in the presence of the suppressor. 
Among these were the genes yaiN, adhC, and yaiM, forming a single putative 
operon whose likely function is the degradation of formaldehyde. Expression of 
wild-type yaiN was shown to result in repression of the operon, while a 
suppression-mimicking allele lacking the amber stop codon and extended 7 amino 
acids did not. The operon was shown to be induced by formaldehyde, and the genes 
have been renamed frmR, frmA, and frmB, respectively.

Ni(II) Sensing by RcnR Does Not Require an FrmR-Like Intersubunit Linkage.

Huang HT, Maroney MJ.

E. coli RcnR (resistance to cobalt and nickel regulator) is a homotetrameric DNA 
binding protein that regulates the expression of a Ni(II) and Co(II) exporter 
(RcnAB) by derepressing expression of rcnA and rcnB in response to binding 
Co(II) or Ni(II). Prior studies have shown that the cognate metal ions, Ni(II) 
and Co(II), bind in six-coordinate sites at subunit interfaces and are 
distinguished from noncognate metals (Cu(I), Cu(II), and Zn(II)) by coordination 
number and ligand selection. In analogy with FrmR, a formaldehyde-responsive 
transcriptional regulator in the RcnR/CsoR family, the interfacial site allows 
the metal ions to "cross-link" the N-terminal domain of one subunit with the 
invariant Cys35 residue in another, which has been deemed to be key to mediating 
the allosteric response of the tetrameric protein to metal binding. Through the 
use of mutagenesis to disconnect one subunit from the metal-mediated cross-link, 
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as a structural probe, LacZ reporter assays, 
and metal binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the work 
presented here shows that neither the interfacial binding site nor the 
coordination number of Ni(II) is important to the allosteric response to binding 
of this cognate metal ion. The opposite is found for the other cognate metal 
ion, Co(II), with respect to the interfacial binding site, suggesting that the 
molecular mechanisms for transcriptional regulation by the two ions are 
distinct. The metal binding studies reveal that tight metal binding is 
maintained in the variant. XAS is further used to demonstrate that His33 is not 
a ligand for Co(II), Ni(II), or Zn(II) in WT-RcnR. The results are discussed in 
the context of the overall understanding of the molecular mechanisms of 
metallosensors.

FrmR in vivo and in vitro Quantifying the number of FrmR molecules per cell and 
modeling formaldehyde modification as a function of [formaldehyde] demonstrates 
that FrmR reactivity is optimized such that FrmR is modified and frmRA is 
derepressed at lower [formaldehyde] than required to generate 
S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione. Expression of FrmA is thereby coordinated with the 
accumulation of its substrate.

FrmR from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (a CsoR/RcnR-like 
transcriptional de-repressor) is shown to repress the frmRA operator-promoter, 
and repression is alleviated by formaldehyde but not manganese, iron, cobalt, 
nickel, copper, or Zn(II) within cells. In contrast, repression by a mutant 
FrmRE64H (which gains an RcnR metal ligand) is alleviated by cobalt and Zn(II). 
Unexpectedly, FrmR was found to already bind Co(II), Zn(II), and Cu(I), and 
moreover metals, as well as formaldehyde, trigger an allosteric response that 
weakens DNA affinity. However, the sensory metal sites of the cells' endogenous 
metal sensors (RcnR, ZntR, Zur, and CueR) are all tighter than FrmR for their 
cognate metals. Furthermore, the endogenous metal sensors are shown to 
out-compete FrmR. The metal-sensing FrmRE64H mutant has tighter metal affinities 
than FrmR by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Gain of cobalt sensing by 
FrmRE64H remains enigmatic because the cobalt affinity of FrmRE64H is 
substantially weaker than that of the endogenous cobalt sensor. Cobalt sensing 
requires glutathione, which may assist cobalt access, conferring a kinetic 
advantage. For Zn(II), the metal affinity of FrmRE64H approaches the metal 
affinities of cognate Zn(II) sensors. Counter-intuitively, the allosteric 
coupling free energy for Zn(II) is smaller in metal-sensing FrmRE64H compared 
with nonsensing FrmR. By determining the copies of FrmR and FrmRE64H tetramers 
per cell, then estimating promoter occupancy as a function of intracellular 
Zn(II) concentration, we show how a modest tightening of Zn(II) affinity, plus 
weakened DNA affinity of the apoprotein, conspires to make the relative 
properties of FrmRE64H (compared with ZntR and Zur) sufficient to sense Zn(II) 
inside cells.

Ni(II) Sensing by RcnR Does Not Require an FrmR-Like Intersubunit Linkage.

Huang HT, Maroney MJ.

E. coli RcnR (resistance to cobalt and nickel regulator) is a homotetrameric DNA 
binding protein that regulates the expression of a Ni(II) and Co(II) exporter 
(RcnAB) by derepressing expression of rcnA and rcnB in response to binding 
Co(II) or Ni(II). Prior studies have shown that the cognate metal ions, Ni(II) 
and Co(II), bind in six-coordinate sites at subunit interfaces and are 
distinguished from noncognate metals (Cu(I), Cu(II), and Zn(II)) by coordination 
number and ligand selection. In analogy with FrmR, a formaldehyde-responsive 
transcriptional regulator in the RcnR/CsoR family, the interfacial site allows 
the metal ions to "cross-link" the N-terminal domain of one subunit with the 
invariant Cys35 residue in another, which has been deemed to be key to mediating 
the allosteric response of the tetrameric protein to metal binding. Through the 
use of mutagenesis to disconnect one subunit from the metal-mediated cross-link, 
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as a structural probe, LacZ reporter assays, 
and metal binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the work 
presented here shows that neither the interfacial binding site nor the 
coordination number of Ni(II) is important to the allosteric response to binding 
of this cognate metal ion. The opposite is found for the other cognate metal 
ion, Co(II), with respect to the interfacial binding site, suggesting that the 
molecular mechanisms for transcriptional regulation by the two ions are 
distinct. The metal binding studies reveal that tight metal binding is 
maintained in the variant. XAS is further used to demonstrate that His33 is not 
a ligand for Co(II), Ni(II), or Zn(II) in WT-RcnR. The results are discussed in 
the context of the overall understanding of the molecular mechanisms of 
metallosensors.

Escherichia coli O157:H7 poses a threat to humans through food- and water-borne 
transmission. To investigate how environmental stresses affect the Escherichia 
coli O157:H7 transcriptome, we designed a targeted microarray consisting of 
stress response and virulence genes (n = 125) to analyze the impact of acidified 
(pH 3.5), cold (7.5 degrees C), and fresh tryptic soy broth (TSB) (37 degrees C) 
on E. coli O157:H7 stress response and virulence gene expression. Nutrient 
replenishment with fresh TSB resulted in 72 differentially expressed genes (> or 
= 1.5-fold change; p < 0.05), with 65 induced. All queried global and specific 
stress regulators were affected, as were 12 virulence genes. Cold-shocked cells 
displayed 17 differentially expressed genes, with 10 being induced. Induction of 
rpoS, members of the sigma(H) regulon (clpB, dnaK, ftsH), and acid resistance 
(AR) genes (gadA, gadX) was observed. Porin transcript (ompC, ompF) and gapA and 
tufA ancillary genes were repressed. Acid shock resulted in 24 differentially 
expressed genes, with 21 induced. No induction of any stationary phase AR system 
was observed, though acid-coping mechanisms were recruited, including mar and 
phoB induction, and repression of ompC and ompF. Stress regulators were induced, 
including relA, soxS, rpoE, and rpoH. The microarray data were validated by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Exposure to sublethal stress 
events led to the induction of diverse stress response networks. In the food 
chain, sublethal events may render cells increasingly resistant to future 
stresses, potentially leading to increased survival.

BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli O157:H7 (O157) strain 86-24, linked to a 1986 
disease outbreak, displays curli- and biofilm-negative phenotypes that are 
correlated with the lack of Congo red (CR) binding and formation of white 
colonies (CR-) on a CR-containing medium. However, on a CR medium this strain 
produces red isolates (CR+) capable of producing curli fimbriae and biofilms.
RESULTS: To identify genes controlling differential expression of curli fimbriae 
and biofilm formation, the RNA-Seq profile of a CR+ isolate was compared to the 
CR- parental isolate. Of the 242 genes expressed differentially in the CR+ 
isolate, 201 genes encoded proteins of known functions while the remaining 41 
encoded hypothetical proteins. Among the genes with known functions, 149 were 
down- and 52 were up-regulated. Some of the upregulated genes were linked to 
biofilm formation through biosynthesis of curli fimbriae and flagella. The genes 
encoding transcriptional regulators, such as CsgD, QseB, YkgK, YdeH, Bdm, CspD, 
BssR and FlhDC, which modulate biofilm formation, were significantly altered in 
their expression. Several genes of the envelope stress (cpxP), heat shock (rpoH, 
htpX, degP), oxidative stress (ahpC, katE), nutrient limitation stress 
(phoB-phoR and pst) response pathways, and amino acid metabolism were 
downregulated in the CR+ isolate. Many genes mediating acid resistance and 
colanic acid biosynthesis, which influence biofilm formation directly or 
indirectly, were also down-regulated. Comparative genomics of CR+ and CR- 
isolates revealed the presence of a short duplicated sequence in the rcsB gene 
of the CR+ isolate. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of RcsB of the two 
isolates showed truncation of RcsB in the CR+ isolate at the insertion site of 
the duplicated sequence. Complementation of CR+ isolate with rcsB of the CR- 
parent restored parental phenotypes to the CR+ isolate.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that RcsB is a global regulator 
affecting bacterial survival in growth-restrictive environments through 
upregulation of genes promoting biofilm formation while downregulating certain 
metabolic functions. Understanding whether rcsB inactivation enhances 
persistence and survival of O157 in carrier animals and the environment would be 
important in developing strategies for controlling this bacterial pathogen in 
these niches.

Escherichia coli.

California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. liaoj@ucla.edu

Isobutanol has emerged as a potential biofuel due to recent metabolic 
engineering efforts. Here we used gene expression and transcription network 
connectivity data, genetic knockouts, and network component analysis (NCA) to 
map the initial isobutanol response network of Escherichia coli under aerobic 
conditions. NCA revealed profound perturbations to respiration. Further 
investigation showed ArcA as an important mediator of this response. 
Quinone/quinol malfunction was postulated to activate ArcA, Fur, and PhoB in 
this study. In support of this hypothesis, quinone-linked ArcA and Fur target 
expressions were significantly less perturbed by isobutanol under fermentative 
growth whereas quinol-linked PhoB target expressions remained activated, and 
isobutanol impeded growth on glycerol, which requires quinones, more than on 
glucose. In addition, ethanol, n-butanol, and isobutanol response networks were 
compared. n-Butanol and isobutanol responses were qualitatively similar, whereas 
ethanol had notable induction differences of pspABCDE and ndh, whose gene 
products manage proton motive force. The network described here could aid design 
and comprehension of alcohol tolerance, whereas the approach provides a general 
framework to characterize complex phenomena at the systems level.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) has multiple copies of the chaperone-usher (CU) pili 
operon in five fimbria groups: CU pili, curli, type IV pili, type III secretion 
pili, and type IV secretion pili. Commensal E. coli K-12 contains 12 CU pili 
operons. Among these operons, Sfm is expressed by the sfmACDHF operon. 
Transcriptome analyses, reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR 
analyses reported that FimZ directly binds to and activates the sfmA promoter, 
transcribing sfmACDHF. In addition, FimZ regularly induces constant cell 
elongation in E. coli, which is required for F-type ATPase function. The 
bacterial two-hybrid system showed a specific interaction between FimZ and the α 
subunit of the cytoplasmic F1 domain of F-type ATPase. Studies performed using 
mutated FimZs have revealed two active forms, I and II. Active form I is 
required for constant cell elongation involving amino acid residues K106 and 
D109. Active form II additionally required D56, a putative phosphorylation site, 
to activate the sfmA promoter. The chromosomal fimZ was hardly expressed in 
parent strain but functioned in phoB and phoP double-gene knockout strains. 
These insights may help to understand bacterial invasion restricted host 
environments by the sfm γ-type pili.

Cryptic prophages are not genomic junk but instead enable cells to combat myriad 
stresses as an active stress response. How these phage fossils affect persister 
cell resuscitation has, however, not been explored. Persister cells form as a 
result of stresses such as starvation, antibiotics and oxidative conditions, and 
resuscitation of these persister cells likely causes recurring infections such 
as those associated with tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis and Lyme disease. 
Deletion of each of the nine Escherichia coli cryptic prophages has no effect on 
persister cell formation. Strikingly, elimination of each cryptic prophage 
results in an increase in persister cell resuscitation with a dramatic increase 
in resuscitation upon deleting all nine prophages. This increased resuscitation 
includes eliminating the need for a carbon source and is due to activation of 
the phosphate import system resulting from inactivating the transcriptional 
regulator AlpA of the CP4-57 cryptic prophage. Deletion of alpA increases 
persister resuscitation, and AlpA represses phosphate regulator PhoR. Both 
phosphate regulators PhoP and PhoB stimulate resuscitation. This suggests a 
novel cellular stress mechanism controlled by cryptic prophages: regulation of 
phosphate uptake which controls the exit of the cell from dormancy and prevents 
premature resuscitation in the absence of nutrients.

Bacteria survive in the environment with three steps: a sensing environmental 
conditions, a responding to sensed signals, and an adaptation for proper 
survival in the environment. An adapting bacterial cell occurs cell division to 
increase the number of sister cells, termed adaptive growth. Two-component 
systems (TCSs), representing the main bacterial signal transduction systems, 
consist of a pair of one sensor kinase (SK) and one response regulator (RR), and 
RR genes are abundant in most bacterial genomes as part of the core genome. The 
OmpR gene family, a group of RR genes, is conserved in 95% of known bacterial 
genomes. The Escherichia coli genome has an estimated 34 RR genes in total, 
including 14 genes of OmpR family genes. To reveal the contribution of TCSs for 
fast growth as an adaptive growth strategy of E. coli, we isolated a set of gene 
knockout strains by using newly developed genome editing technology, the HoSeI 
(Homologous Sequence Integration) method, based on CRISPR-Cas9. The statistics 
of single cell observation show a knockout of an arbitrary pair of phoP, phoB, 
and ompR genes, stably expressed by positive feedback regulation, dramatically 
inhibit the optimum adaptive growth of E. coli. These insights suggest that the 
adaptive growth of bacteria is fulfilled by the optimum high intracellular level 
of regulators acquired during growth under environmental conditions.

Activation of the PhoPR-Mediated Response to Phosphate Limitation Is Regulated 
by Wall Teichoic Acid Metabolism in Bacillus subtilis.

Devine KM(1).

Phosphorous is essential for cell viability. To ensure an adequate supply under 
phosphate limiting conditions, bacteria induce a cohort of enzymes to scavenge 
for phosphate, and a high affinity transporter for its uptake into the cell. 
This response is controlled by a two-component signal transduction system named 
PhoBR in Escherichia coli and PhoPR in Bacillus subtilis. PhoR is a sensor 
kinase whose activity is responsive to phosphate availability. Under phosphate 
limiting conditions, PhoR exists in kinase mode that phosphorylates its cognate 
response regulator (PhoB, PhoP). When activated, PhoB∼P/PhoP∼P execute changes 
in gene expression that adapt cells to the phosphate limited state. Under 
phosphate replete conditions, PhoR exists in phosphatase mode that maintains 
PhoB/PhoP in an inactive, non-phosphorylated state. The mechanism by which 
phosphate availability is sensed and how it controls the balance between PhoR 
kinase and phosphatase activities has been studied in E. coli and B. subtilis. 
Two different mechanisms have emerged. In the most common mechanism, PhoR 
activity is responsive to phosphate transport through a PstSCAB/PhoU signaling 
complex that relays the conformational status of the transporter to PhoR. In the 
second mechanism currently confined to B. subtilis, PhoR activity is responsive 
to wall teichoic acid metabolism whereby biosynthetic intermediates can promote 
or inhibit PhoR autokinase activity. Variations of both mechanisms are found 
that allow each bacterial species to adapt to phosphate availability in their 
particular environmental niche.

Phosphorus is an essential element assimilated largely as orthophosphate (Pi). 
Cells respond to Pi starvation by importing Pi from their surroundings. We now 
report that impaired protein synthesis alone triggers a Pi starvation response 
even when Pi is plentiful in the extracellular milieu. In the bacterium 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, this response entails phosphorylation 
of the regulatory protein PhoB and transcription of PhoB-dependent Pi 
transporter genes and is eliminated upon stimulation of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) hydrolysis. When protein synthesis is impaired due to low cytoplasmic 
magnesium (Mg2+), Salmonella triggers the Pi starvation response because 
ribosomes are destabilized, which reduces ATP consumption and thus free 
cytoplasmic Pi. This response is transient because low cytoplasmic Mg2+ promotes 
an uptake in Mg2+ and a decrease in ATP levels, which stabilizes ribosomes, 
resulting in ATP consumption and Pi increase, thus ending the response. Notably, 
pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis also elicited a Pi starvation 
response in the bacterium Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae Our findings identify a regulatory connection between protein 
synthesis and Pi homeostasis that is widespread in nature.

DNA-binding specificity of the virulence-associated response regulator from 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis PhoP-PhoR two-component system is essential for 
virulence in animal models of tuberculosis. Genetic and biochemical studies 
indicate that PhoP regulates the expression of more than 110 genes in M. 
tuberculosis. The C-terminal effector domain of PhoP exhibits a winged 
helix-turn-helix motif with the molecular surfaces around the recognition helix 
(alpha 8) displaying strong positive electrostatic potential, suggesting its 
role in DNA binding and nucleotide sequence recognition. Here, the relative 
importance of interfacial alpha 8-DNA contacts has been tested through rational 
mutagenesis coupled with in vitro binding-affinity studies. Most PhoP mutants, 
each with a potential DNA contacting residue replaced with Ala, had 
significantly reduced DNA binding affinity. However, substitution of 
nonconserved Glu215 had a major effect on the specificity of recognition. 
Although lack of specificity does not necessarily correlate with gross change in 
the overall DNA binding properties of PhoP, structural superposition of the PhoP 
C-domain on the Escherichia coli PhoB C-domain-DNA complex suggests a 
base-specific interaction between Glu215 of PhoP and the ninth base of the DR1 
repeat motif. Biochemical experiments corroborate these results, showing that 
DNA recognition specificity can be altered by as little as a single residue 
change of the protein or a single base change of the DNA. The results have 
implications for the mechanism of sequence-specific DNA binding by PhoP.

The response regulator PhoP is part of the PhoQ/PhoP two-component system 
involved in responses to depletion of extracellular Mg(2+). Here, we report the 
crystal structures of the receiver domain of Escherichia coli PhoP determined in 
the absence and presence of the phosphoryl analog beryllofluoride. In the 
presence of beryllofluoride, the active receiver domain forms a twofold 
symmetric dimer similar to that seen in structures of other regulatory domains 
from the OmpR/PhoB family, providing further evidence that members of this 
family utilize a common mode of dimerization in the active state. In the absence 
of activating agents, the PhoP receiver domain crystallizes with a similar 
structure, consistent with the previous observation that high concentrations can 
promote an active state of PhoP independent of phosphorylation.

Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, England.

The response regulator VicR from the Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus 
faecalis forms part of the two-component signal transduction system of the YycFG 
subfamily. The structure of the DNA-binding domain of VicR, VicR(c), has been 
solved and belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family. It is very similar to 
the DNA-binding domains of Escherichia coli PhoB and OmpR, despite low sequence 
similarity, but differs in two important loops. The alpha-loop, which links the 
two helices of the helix-turn-helix motif, is similar to that of PhoB, where it 
has been implicated in contacting the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase, but 
differs from that of OmpR. Conversely, the loop following the helix-turn-helix 
motif is similar to that of OmpR and differs from that of PhoB. YycF/VicR, PhoB 
and Bacillus subtilis PhoP regulators all recognize almost identical DNA 
sequences and although there is currently no experimental evidence linking this 
loop with the DNA, the structure is consistent with possible involvement in 
selective DNA recognition or binding.

A variety of bacterial cellular responses to environmental signals are mediated 
by two-component signal transduction systems comprising a membrane-associated 
histidine protein kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator (RR), which 
interpret specific stimuli and produce a measured physiological response. In RR 
activation, transient phosphorylation of a highly conserved aspartic acid 
residue drives the conformation changes needed for full activation of the 
protein. Sequence homology reveals that RR02 from Streptococcus pneumoniae 
belongs to the OmpR subfamily of RRs. The structures of the receiver domains 
from four members of this family, DrrB and DrrD from Thermotoga maritima, PhoB 
from Escherichia coli, and PhoP from Bacillus subtilis, have been elucidated. 
These domains are globally very similar in that they are composed of a doubly 
wound alpha(5)beta(5); however, they differ remarkably in the fine detail of the 
beta4-alpha4 and alpha4 regions. The structures presented here reveal a further 
difference of the geometry in this region. RR02 is has been shown to be the 
essential RR in the gram-positive bacterium S. pneumoniae R. Lange, C. Wagner, 
A. de Saizieu, N. Flint, J. Molnos, M. Stieger, P. Caspers, M. Kamber, W. Keck,

35:566-576, 2000). RR02 functions as part of a phosphotransfer system that 
ultimately controls the levels of competence within the bacteria. Here we report 
the native structure of the receiver domain of RR02 from serotype 4 S. 
pneumoniae (as well as acetate- and phosphate-bound forms) at different pH 
levels. Two native structures at 2.3 A, phased by single-wavelength anomalous 
diffraction (xenon SAD), and 1.85 A and a third structure at pH 5.9 revealed the 
presence of a phosphate ion outside the active site. The fourth structure 
revealed the presence of an acetate molecule in the active site.

Residues required for Bacillus subtilis PhoP DNA binding or RNA polymerase 
interaction: alanine scanning of PhoP effector domain transactivation loop and 
alpha helix 3.

Bacillus subtilis PhoP is a member of the OmpR family of response regulators 
that activates or represses genes of the Pho regulon upon phosphorylation by 
PhoR in response to phosphate deficiency. Because PhoP binds DNA and is a dimer 
in solution independent of its phosphorylation state, phosphorylation of PhoP 
may optimize DNA binding or the interaction with RNA polymerase. We describe 
alanine scanning mutagenesis of the PhoP alpha loop and alpha helix 3 region of 
PhoPC (Val190 to E214) and functional analysis of the mutated proteins. Eight 
residues important for DNA binding were clustered between Val202 and Arg210. 
Using in vivo and in vitro functional analyses, we identified three classes of 
mutated proteins. Class I proteins (PhoP(I206A), PhoP(R210A), PhoP(L209A), and 
PhoP(H208A)) were phosphorylation proficient and could dimerize but could not 
bind DNA or activate transcription in vivo or in vitro. Class II proteins 
(PhoP(H205A) and PhoP(V204A)) were phosphorylation proficient and could dimerize 
but could not bind DNA prior to phosphorylation. Members of this class had 
higher transcription activation in vitro than in vivo. The class III mutants, 
PhoP(V202A) and PhoP(D203A), had a reduced rate of phosphotransfer and could 
dimerize but could not bind DNA or activate transcription in vivo or in vitro. 
Seven alanine substitutions in PhoP (PhoP(V190A), PhoP(W191A), PhoP(Y193A), 
PhoP(F195A), PhoP(G197A,) PhoP(T199A), and PhoP(R200A)) that specifically 
affected transcription activation were broadly distributed throughout the 
transactivation loop extending from Val190 to as far toward the C terminus as 
Arg200. PhoP(W191A) and PhoP(R200A) could not activate transcription, while the 
other five mutant proteins showed decreased transcription activation in vivo or 
in vitro or both. The mutagenesis studies may indicate that PhoP has a long 
transactivation loop and a short alpha helix 3, more similar to OmpR than to 
PhoB of Escherichia coli.

Comprehensive analysis of OmpR phosphorylation, dimerization, and DNA binding 
supports a canonical model for activation.

The OmpR/PhoB family of response regulators (RRs) is the largest class of 
two-component system signal transduction proteins. Extensive biochemical and 
structural characterization of these transcription factors has provided insights 
into their activation and DNA-binding mechanisms. For the most part, OmpR/PhoB 
family proteins are thought to become activated through phosphorylation from 
their cognate histidine kinase partners, which in turn facilitates an allosteric 
change in the RR, enabling homodimerization and subsequently enhanced DNA 
binding. Incongruently, it has been suggested that OmpR, the eponymous member of 
this RR family, becomes activated via different mechanisms, whereby DNA binding 
plays a central role in facilitating dimerization and phosphorylation. 
Characterization of the rate and extent of the phosphorylation of OmpR and OmpR 
DNA-binding mutants following activation of the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system 
shows that DNA binding is not essential for phosphorylation of OmpR in vivo. In 
addition, detailed analyses of the energetics of DNA binding and dimerization of 
OmpR in both its unphosphorylated and phosphorylated state indicate that 
phosphorylation enhances OmpR dimerization and that this dimerization 
enhancement is the energetic driving force for phosphorylation-mediated 
regulation of OmpR-DNA binding. These findings suggest that OmpR 
phosphorylation-mediated activation follows the same paradigm as the other 
members of the OmpR/PhoB family of RRs in contrast to previously proposed models 
of OmpR activation.

The response regulator OmpR oligomerizes via beta-sheets to form head-to-head 
dimers.

Angeles, CA 90095-1569, USA.

In Escherichia coli, the EnvZ/OmpR two-component regulatory system regulates 
expression of the porin genes ompF and ompC in response to changes in 
osmolarity. It has recently become apparent that OmpR functions as a global 
regulator, by regulating the expression of many genes in addition to the porin 
genes. OmpR consists of two domains; phosphorylation of the N-terminal receiver 
domain increases DNA binding affinity of the C-terminal domain and vice versa. 
Many response regulators including PhoB and FixJ dimerize upon phosphorylation. 
Here, we demonstrate that OmpR dimerization is stimulated by phosphorylation or 
by DNA binding. The dimerization interface revealed here was unanticipated and 
had previously not been predicted. Using the accepted head-to-tail 
tandem-binding model as a guide, we set out to examine the intermolecular 
interactions between OmpR dimers bound to DNA by protein-protein cross-linking 
methods. Surprisingly, amino acid positions that we expected to form 
cross-linked dimers did not. Conversely, positions predicted not to form dimers 
did. Because of these results, we designed a series of 23 cysteine-substituted 
OmpR mutants that were used to investigate dimer interfaces formed via the 
beta-sheet region. This four-stranded beta-sheet is a unique feature of the OmpR 
group of winged helix-turn-helix proteins. Many of the cysteine-substituted 
mutants are dominant to wild-type OmpR, are phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate 
as well as the cognate kinase EnvZ, and the cross-linked proteins are capable of 
binding to DNA. Our results are consistent with a model in which OmpR binds to 
DNA in a head-to-head orientation, in contrast to the previously proposed 
asymmetric head-to-tail model. They also raise the possibility that OmpR may be 
capable of adopting more than one orientation as it binds to a vast array of 
genes to activate or repress transcription.

Interdomain linkers of homologous response regulators determine their mechanism 
of action.

Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97201-3098, USA.

OmpR and PhoB are response regulators that contain an N-terminal phosphorylation 
domain and a C-terminal DNA binding effector domain connected by a flexible 
interdomain linker. Phosphorylation of the N terminus results in an increase in 
affinity for specific DNA and the subsequent regulation of gene expression. 
Despite their sequence and structural similarity, OmpR and PhoB employ different 
mechanisms to regulate their effector domains. Phosphorylation of OmpR in the N 
terminus stimulates the DNA binding affinity of the C terminus, whereas 
phosphorylation of the PhoB N terminus relieves inhibition of the C terminus, 
enabling it to bind to DNA. Chimeras between OmpR and PhoB containing either 
interdomain linker were constructed to explore the basis of the differences in 
their activation mechanisms. Our results indicate that effector domain 
regulation by either N terminus requires its cognate interdomain linker. In 
addition, our findings suggest that the isolated C terminus of OmpR is not 
sufficient for a productive interaction with RNA polymerase.

Roles of hilC and hilD in regulation of hilA expression in Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium.

Lucas RL(1), Lee CA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Harvard Medical School, 
Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Sequences between -332 and -39 upstream of the hilA promoter are required for 
repression of hilA. An unidentified repressor is thought to bind these upstream 
repressing sequences (URS) to inhibit hilA expression. Two AraC-like 
transcriptional regulators encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1), 
HilC and HilD, bind to the URS to counteract the repression of hilA. The URS is 
required for regulation of hilA by osmolarity, oxygen, PhoP/PhoQ, and SirA/BarA. 
Here, we show that FadD, FliZ, PhoB, and EnvZ/OmpR also require the URS to 
regulate hilA. These environmental and regulatory factors may affect hilA 
expression by altering the expression or activity of HilC, HilD, or the unknown 
repressor. To begin investigating these possibilities, we tested the effects of 
environmental and regulatory factors on hilC and hilD expression. We also 
examined hilA regulation when hilC or hilD was disrupted or expressed to a high 
level. Although hilC is regulated by all environmental conditions and regulatory 
factors that modulate hilA expression, hilC is not required for the regulation 
of hilA by any conditions or factors except EnvZ/OmpR. In contrast, hilD is 
absolutely required for hilA expression, but environmental conditions and 
regulatory factors have little or no effect on hilD expression. We speculate 
that EnvZ/OmpR regulates hilA by altering the expression and/or activity of 
hilC, while all other regulatory conditions and mutations regulate hilA by 
modulating hilD posttranscriptionally. We also discuss models in which the 
regulation of hilA expression is mediated by modulation of the expression or 
activity of one or more repressors.

Inorganic polyphosphate regulates responses of Escherichia coli to nutritional 
stringencies, environmental stresses and survival in the stationary phase.

Rao NN(1), Kornberg A.

California 94305-5307, USA.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for polyP accumulation in E. coli remain 
largely obscure. Based on the available data, a tentative model is proposed 
(Fig. 1; Ault-Riché et al. 1998). Inhibition by (p)ppGpp of PPX interrupts the 
dynamic balance between the synthesis of polyP by PPK and its hydrolysis by PPX, 
accounting for polyP accumulation. However, mutants lacking PhoB, the response 
regulator of the Pho regulon, fail to accumulate polyP even in the face of high 
levels of (p)ppGpp. Clearly, PhoB is required in some undefined manner. With 
regard to osmotic stress, the pathway to polyP accumulation is also distinct 
from the one identified with the activation of envZ and the associated changes 
in membrane functions. A tentative scheme attempting to describe the metabolic 
turnover of polyP is given in Fig. 4. [figure: see text] In adaptations to 
stress, cells must coordinate major changes in the rates of transcription, 
translation, and replication as well as make choices in the genes expressed 
(Kolter et al. 1993). PolyP could provide activated phosphates or coordinate an 
adaptive response by binding metals and/or specific proteins. Accumulation of 
polyP in E. coli and other organisms is commonly assumed to provide a reservoir 
of energy convertible to ATP. This seems implausible because of the turnover of 
ATP which consumes only a fraction of a second (Chapman and Atkinson 1977). 
Thus, other functions for polyP need to be considered, among them a regulatory 
role. PolyP, even at very low levels, is essential in E. coli for adaptations in 
stationary phase and for survival (Rao and Kornberg 1996). As a polyanionic 
polymer, polyP has chemical similarities to DNA and RNA in interactions with 
basic domains of proteins. Further investigation of the cellular location of 
polyP, its state of metabolic availability and identification of its binding 
partners are needed. In view of the ubiquity of polyP in eukaryotic cells 
(including dynamic turnover in the nuclei of some mammalian cells), studies 
similar to those undertaken in E. coli may reveal comparable functions.

Involvement of the sensor kinase EnvZ in the in vivo activation of the 
response-regulator PhoB by acetyl phosphate.

Kim SK(1), Wilmes-Riesenberg MR, Wanner BL.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 
47907, USA.

Three signalling pathways lead to activation of the phosphate (Pho) regulon by 
phosphorylation of the response-regulator PhoB in Escherichia coli. One pathway 
responds to the extracellular inorganic phosphate (PI) level and leads to 
activation by the Pi sensor kinase, PhoR. The other two pathways are Pi 
independent and are apparent in the absence of PhoR. One Pi-independent pathway 
responds to the level of an unknown catabolite and leads to activation by the 
catabolite regulatory sensor kinase, CreC (originally called PhoM); the other 
Pi-independent pathway responds to acetyl phosphate and leads to activation by a 
process requiring acetyl phosphate. Here we show that activation of PhoB by 
acetyl phosphate can require the sensor kinase EnvZ. Accordingly, we propose 
that the in vivo activation of PhoB by acetyl phosphate (and perhaps other 
two-component response-regulators as well) probably always requires a certain 
kinase that can vary depending upon the growth conditions.

Cloning and identification of a two-component signal-transducing regulatory 
system from Bacteroides fragilis.

Rasmussen BA(1), Kovacs E.

Author information:
(1)Molecular Biology Section, American Cyanamid Company, Pearl River, New York, 
NY 10965.

A DNA fragment was cloned from Bacteroides fragilis that bestowed low-level 
tetracycline resistance to Escherichia coli strains harbouring the cloned 
fragment on a multicopy plasmid. The tetracycline resistance determinant was 
localized to a 4.3kb Bg/II-PstI subfragment of the original clone. DNA sequence 
analysis of this fragment revealed that it contained an operon encoding two 
proteins: one of 519 amino acids, RprX, and a second of 236 amino acids, RprY. 
Protein sequence analysis revealed that the two proteins shared sequence 
identity with a family of multicomponent signal-transducing regulatory proteins 
identified from many diverse bacterial genera. RprX shared identity with the 
first component of the regulatory system, the histidine protein kinase receptor 
(for example EnvZ, PhoR, CheA, and VirA). RprY shared identity with the second 
member of the regulatory protein pair, the regulatory response protein (for 
example OmpR, PhoB, CheY, and VirG). Expression of these proteins from a 
multicopy plasmid vector in E. coli resulted in a decrease in the level of the 
outer membrane porin protein OmpF and an increase in the level of the outer 
membrane porin protein OmpC. The decrease in OmpF levels correlates with, and 
may be the cause of, the increased tetracycline resistance. Regulation of the 
levels of OmpF and OmpC is normally controlled by a multicomponent 
signal-transducing regulatory pair of proteins, EnvZ and OmpR. The effect RprX 
and RprY have on OmpF expression is mediated at the level of transcription. 
Thus, RprX and RprY may be interfering with the normal regulation of OmpF by 
OmpR and EnvZ.

A two-component regulatory system required for copper-inducible expression of 
the copper resistance operon of Pseudomonas syringae.

92521-0122.

Specific induction of the copper resistance operon (cop) promoter from 
Pseudomonas syringae was measured by beta-galactosidase production from a cop 
promoter-lacZ fusion. Induction of the cop promoter in P. syringae pv. syringae 
required trans-acting factors from copper resistance plasmid pPT23D, from which 
cop was originally cloned. Tn5 mutagenesis of pPT23D was used to localize two 
complementation groups immediately downstream from copABCD. Cloning and 
sequencing of the DNA in this region revealed two genes, copR and copS, 
expressed in the same orientation as the cop operon but from a separate 
constitutive promoter. The amino acid sequence deduced from these genes showed 
distinct similarities to known two-component regulatory systems, including 
PhoB-PhoR and OmpR-EnvZ. In addition, CopR showed strong similarity to copper 
resistance activator protein PcoR from Escherichia coli. Functional chromosomal 
homologs to copRS activated the cop promoter, in a copper-inducible manner, in 
copper-resistant or -sensitive strains of P. syringae pv. tomato and other 
Pseudomonas species. This implies that copper-inducible gene regulation is 
associated with a common chromosomally encoded function, as well as 
plasmid-borne copper resistance, in Pseudomonas spp.

KdpD and KdpE, proteins that control expression of the kdpABC operon, are 
members of the two-component sensor-effector class of regulators.

The Kdp system of Escherichia coli, a transport ATPase with high affinity for 
potassium, is expressed when turgor pressure is low. Expression requires KdpD, a 
99-kDa membrane protein, and KdpE, a 25-kDa soluble cytoplasmic protein. The 
sequences of KdpD and KdpE show they are members of the sensor-effector class of 
regulatory proteins: the C-terminal half of KdpD is homologous to sensors such 
as EnvZ and PhoR, and KdpE is homologous to effectors such as OmpR and PhoB. The 
predicted structure of KdpD suggests that it is anchored to the membrane by four 
membrane-spanning segments near its middle, with both C- and N-terminal portions 
in the cytoplasm. Subcellular fractionation confirms the expected location of 
the protein in the inner membrane. The N-terminal region has no homology to 
known proteins and is the site of mutations that make Kdp expression partially 
constitutive; this portion may serve to sense turgor pressure. Since several 
other sensor-effectors have been shown to mediate control through 
phosphorylation, this mechanism is proposed to control expression of Kdp.

Osmotic regulation of PhoE porin synthesis in Escherichia coli.

Meyer SE(1), Granett S, Jung JU, Villarejo MR.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, Davis 
95616.

In Escherichia coli, adaptation to hyperosmotic conditions alters the expression 
of the outer membrane porins OmpF and OmpC. The amount of PhoE porin, which is 
normally induced by phosphate deprivation, was greatly reduced in cells adapted 
to high-osmolarity conditions. Osmoregulation of PhoE operated independently of

Bacteria survive in the environment with three steps: a sensing environmental 
conditions, a responding to sensed signals, and an adaptation for proper 
survival in the environment. An adapting bacterial cell occurs cell division to 
increase the number of sister cells, termed adaptive growth. Two-component 
systems (TCSs), representing the main bacterial signal transduction systems, 
consist of a pair of one sensor kinase (SK) and one response regulator (RR), and 
RR genes are abundant in most bacterial genomes as part of the core genome. The 
OmpR gene family, a group of RR genes, is conserved in 95% of known bacterial 
genomes. The Escherichia coli genome has an estimated 34 RR genes in total, 
including 14 genes of OmpR family genes. To reveal the contribution of TCSs for 
fast growth as an adaptive growth strategy of E. coli, we isolated a set of gene 
knockout strains by using newly developed genome editing technology, the HoSeI 
(Homologous Sequence Integration) method, based on CRISPR-Cas9. The statistics 
of single cell observation show a knockout of an arbitrary pair of phoP, phoB, 
and ompR genes, stably expressed by positive feedback regulation, dramatically 
inhibit the optimum adaptive growth of E. coli. These insights suggest that the 
adaptive growth of bacteria is fulfilled by the optimum high intracellular level 
of regulators acquired during growth under environmental conditions.

In bacteria, 2-component regulatory systems (TCSs) are the critical 
information-processing pathways that link stimuli to specific adaptive 
responses. Signals perceived by membrane sensors, which are generally histidine 
kinases, are transmitted by response regulators (RRs) to allow cells to cope 
rapidly and effectively with environmental challenges. Over the past few 
decades, genes encoding components of TCSs and their responsive proteins have 
been identified, crystal structures have been described, and signaling 
mechanisms have been elucidated. Here, we review recent findings and interesting 
breakthroughs in bacterial TCS research. Furthermore, we discuss structural 
features, mechanisms of activation and regulation, and cross-regulation of RRs, 
with a focus on the largest RR family, OmpR/PhoB, to provide a comprehensive 
overview of these critically important signaling molecules.

The influence of repressor DNA binding site architecture on transcriptional 
control.

How the architecture of DNA binding sites dictates the extent of repression of 
promoters is not well understood. Here, we addressed the importance of the 
number and information content of the three direct repeats (DRs) in the binding 
and repression of the icdA promoter by the phosphorylated form of the global 
Escherichia coli repressor ArcA (ArcA-P). We show that decreasing the 
information content of the two sites with the highest information (DR1 and DR2) 
eliminated ArcA binding to all three DRs and ArcA repression of icdA. 
Unexpectedly, we also found that DR3 occupancy functions principally in 
repression, since mutation of this low-information-content site both eliminated 
DNA binding to DR3 and significantly weakened icdA repression, despite the fact 
that binding to DR1 and DR2 was intact. In addition, increasing the information 
content of any one of the three DRs or addition of a fourth DR increased 
ArcA-dependent repression but perturbed signal-dependent regulation of 
repression. Thus, our data show that the information content and number of DR 
elements are critical architectural features for maintaining a balance between 
high-affinity binding and signal-dependent regulation of icdA promoter function 
in response to changes in ArcA-P levels. Optimization of such architectural 
features may be a common strategy to either dampen or enhance the sensitivity of 
DNA binding among the members of the large OmpR/PhoB family of regulators as 
well as other transcription factors.
IMPORTANCE: In Escherichia coli, the response regulator ArcA maintains 
homeostasis of redox carriers under O2-limiting conditions through a 
comprehensive repression of carbon oxidation pathways that require aerobic 
respiration to recycle redox carriers. Although a binding site architecture 
comprised of a variable number of sequence recognition elements has been 
identified within the promoter regions of ArcA-repressed operons, it is unclear 
how this variable architecture dictates transcriptional regulation. By 
dissecting the role of multiple sequence elements within the icdA promoter, we 
provide insight into the design principles that allow ArcA to repress 
transcription within diverse promoter contexts. Our data suggest that the 
arrangement of recognition elements is tailored to achieve sufficient repression 
of a given promoter while maintaining appropriate signal-dependent regulation of 
repression, providing insight into how diverse binding site architectures link 
changes in O2 with the fine-tuning of carbon oxidation pathway levels.

ChxR is an atypical two-component signal transduction response regulator (RR) of 
the OmpR/PhoB subfamily encoded by the obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen 
Chlamydia trachomatis. Despite structural homology within both receiver and 
effector domains to prototypical subfamily members, ChxR does not require 
phosphorylation for dimer formation, DNA binding or transcriptional activation. 
Thus, we hypothesized that ChxR is in a conformation optimal for DNA binding 
with limited interdomain interactions. To address this hypothesis, the NMR 
solution structure of the ChxR effector domain was determined and used in 
combination with the previously reported ChxR receiver domain structure to 
generate a full-length dimer model based upon SAXS analysis. Small-angle 
scattering of ChxR supported a dimer with minimal interdomain interactions and 
effector domains in a conformation that appears to require only subtle 
reorientation for optimal major/minor groove DNA interactions. SAXS modeling 
also supported that the effector domains were in a head-to-tail conformation, 
consistent with ChxR recognizing tandem DNA repeats. The effector domain 
structure was leveraged to identify key residues that were critical for 
maintaining protein - nucleic acid interactions. In combination with prior 
analysis of the essential location of specific nucleotides for ChxR recognition 
of DNA, a model of the full-length ChxR dimer bound to its cognate cis-acting 
element was generated.

Two-component signal transduction systems consist of pairs of histidine kinases 
and response regulators, which mediate adaptive responses to environmental cues. 
Most activated response regulators regulate transcription by binding tightly to 
promoter DNA via a phosphorylation-triggered inactive-to-active transition. The 
molecular basis for formation of stable response regulator-DNA complexes that 
precede the assembly of RNA polymerases is unclear. Here, we present structures 
of DNA complexed with the response regulator KdpE, a member of the OmpR/PhoB 
family. The distinctively asymmetric complex in an active-like conformation 
reveals a unique intramolecular interface between the receiver domain (RD) and 
the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of only one of the two response regulators in the 
complex. Structure-function studies show that this RD-DBD interface is necessary 
to form stable complexes that support gene expression. The conservation of 
sequence and structure suggests that these findings extend to a large group of 
response regulators that act as transcription factors.

Comprehensive analysis of OmpR phosphorylation, dimerization, and DNA binding

The OmpR/PhoB family of response regulators (RRs) is the largest class of 
two-component system signal transduction proteins. Extensive biochemical and 
structural characterization of these transcription factors has provided insights 
into their activation and DNA-binding mechanisms. For the most part, OmpR/PhoB 
family proteins are thought to become activated through phosphorylation from 
their cognate histidine kinase partners, which in turn facilitates an allosteric 
change in the RR, enabling homodimerization and subsequently enhanced DNA 
binding. Incongruently, it has been suggested that OmpR, the eponymous member of 
this RR family, becomes activated via different mechanisms, whereby DNA binding 
plays a central role in facilitating dimerization and phosphorylation. 
Characterization of the rate and extent of the phosphorylation of OmpR and OmpR 
DNA-binding mutants following activation of the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system 
shows that DNA binding is not essential for phosphorylation of OmpR in vivo. In 
addition, detailed analyses of the energetics of DNA binding and dimerization of 
OmpR in both its unphosphorylated and phosphorylated state indicate that 
phosphorylation enhances OmpR dimerization and that this dimerization 
enhancement is the energetic driving force for phosphorylation-mediated 
regulation of OmpR-DNA binding. These findings suggest that OmpR 
phosphorylation-mediated activation follows the same paradigm as the other 
members of the OmpR/PhoB family of RRs in contrast to previously proposed models 
of OmpR activation.

Structure-function studies of DNA binding domain of response regulator KdpE 
reveals equal affinity interactions at DNA half-sites.

Expression of KdpFABC, a K(+) pump that restores osmotic balance, is controlled 
by binding of the response regulator KdpE to a specific DNA sequence 
(kdpFABC(BS)) via the winged helix-turn-helix type DNA binding domain 
(KdpE(DBD)). Exploration of E. coli KdpE(DBD) and kdpFABC(BS) interaction 
resulted in the identification of two conserved, AT-rich 6 bp direct repeats 
that form half-sites. Despite binding to these half-sites, KdpE(DBD) was 
incapable of promoting gene expression in vivo. Structure-function studies 
guided by our 2.5 Å X-ray structure of KdpE(DBD) revealed the importance of 
residues R193 and R200 in the α-8 DNA recognition helix and T215 in the wing 
region for DNA binding. Mutation of these residues renders KdpE incapable of 
inducing expression of the kdpFABC operon. Detailed biophysical analysis of 
interactions using analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a 2∶1 stoichiometry 
of protein to DNA with dissociation constants of 200±100 and 350±100 nM at 
half-sites. Inactivation of one half-site does not influence binding at the 
other, indicating that KdpE(DBD) binds independently to the half-sites with 
approximately equal affinity and no discernable cooperativity. To our knowledge, 
these data are the first to describe in quantitative terms the binding at 
half-sites under equilibrium conditions for a member of the ubiquitous OmpR/PhoB 
family of proteins.

The complexities of porin genetic regulation.

De la Cruz MA(1), Calva E.

Cuernavaca, México.

Our understanding of porin regulation has revealed not only increasing 
complexity in the regulatory mechanisms, but also that the porin repertoire is 
more extensive than previously conceived. Initially, the OmpR response regulator 
was described as the master regulator of porin genes, but many more regulators 
are involved such as CpxR, PhoB, Lrp, Rob, MarA, SoxS, CadC, CRP, Fnr, ToxR, 
H-NS, StpA, IHF, HU and LeuO. In addition to MicF, the first small RNA (sRNA) 
that was proposed to regulate porin expression, porins are 
post-transcriptionally regulated by a variety of other sRNAs, namely, MicC, 
MicA, IpeX, RseX, InvR, CyaR and RybB. Future challenges include the full 
integration of all the regulatory circuitries. Whether quiescent porins are 
merely replacements of the major porins or are part of novel metabolic programs 
has yet to be elucidated. The comprehensive exploration of the environmental 
determinants that affect porin gene expression should yield valuable new 
information about the functions of these important proteins.

Two-component signal transduction, featuring highly conserved histidine kinases 
(HKs) and response regulators (RRs), is one of the most prevalent signalling 
schemes in prokaryotes. RRs function as phosphorylation-activated switches to 
mediate diverse output responses, mostly via transcription regulation. As 
bacterial genomes typically encode multiple two-component proteins for distinct 
signalling pathways, the sequence and structural similarities of RR receiver 
domains create significant challenges to maintain interaction specificity. It is 
especially demanding for members of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily, the largest RR 
subfamily, which share a conserved dimerization interface for 
phosphorylation-mediated transcription regulation. We developed a strategy to 
investigate RR interaction by analysing Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) 
between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)- and yellow fluorescent protein 
(YFP)-fused RRs in vitro. Using the Escherichia coli RR PhoB as a model system, 
we were able to observe phosphorylation-dependent FRET between fluorescent 
protein (FP)-PhoB proteins and validated the FRET method by determining 
dimerization affinity and dimerization-coupled phosphorylation kinetics that 
recapitulated values determined by alternative methods. Further application of 
the FRET method to all E. coli OmpR/PhoB subfamily RRs revealed that 
phosphorylation-activated RR interaction is indeed a common theme for OmpR/PhoB 
subfamily RRs and these RRs display significant interaction specificity. Weak 
hetero-pair interactions were also identified between several different RRs, 
suggesting potential cross-regulation between distinct pathways.

Amino acids important for DNA recognition by the response regulator OmpR.

Response regulators undergo regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at 
conserved aspartic acid residues in bacterial signal transduction systems. OmpR 
is a winged helix-turnhelix DNA-binding protein that functions as a global 
regulator in bacteria and is also important in pathogenesis. A detailed 
mechanistic picture of how OmpR binds to DNA and activates transcription is 
lacking. We used NMR spectroscopy to solve the solution structure of the 
C-terminal domain of OmpR (OmpR(C)) and to analyze the chemical shift changes 
that occur upon DNA binding. There is little overlap in the interaction surface 
with residues of PhoB that were reportedly involved in protein/protein 
interactions in its head-to-tail dimer. Multiple factors account for the lack of 
overlap. One is that the spacing between the OmpR half-sites is shorter than 
observed with PhoB, requiring the arrangement of the two OmpR molecules to be 
different from that of the PhoB dimer on DNA. A second is the demonstration 
herein that OmpR can bind to its high affinity site as a monomer. As a result, 
OmpR(C) appears to be capable of adopting alternative orientations depending on 
the precise base composition of the binding site, which also contributes to the 
lack of overlap. In the presence of DNA, chemical shift changes occur in OmpR in 
the recognition alpha-helix 3, the loop between beta-strand 4 and alpha-helix 1, 
and the loop between beta-strands 5 and 6. DNA contact residues are Val(203) 
(T), Arg(207) (G), and Arg(209) (phosphate backbone). Our results suggest that 
OmpR binds to DNA as a monomer and then forms a symmetric or asymmetric dimer, 
depending on the binding site. We propose that during activation OmpR binds to 
DNA and undergoes a conformational change that promotes phosphorylation of the 
N-terminal receiver domain, the receiver domains dimerize, and then the second 
monomer binds to DNA. The flexible linker of OmpR enables the second monomer to 
bind in multiple orientations (head-to-tail and head-to-head), depending on the 
specific DNA contacts.

Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of a 15 kb region of the Bacillus subtilis

Within the framework of an international project on the sequencing of the whole 
Bacillus subtilis genome, a 15 kb chromosome segment, which contains the iol 
operon involved in inositol utilization, has been cloned and sequenced. This 
region (14,974 bp) contains 12 complete open reading frames (ORFs; genes) and 
two partial ones; the seventh gene (E83G) is the idh gene encoding inositol 
dehydrogenase. All the genes identified are transcribed in the same direction as 
that of the movement of the replication fork. A homology search for their 
products deduced from the 12 complete ORFs revealed that eight of them exhibit 
significant homology to known proteins such as fructokinase, acetolactate 
synthase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (B. subtilis), and PhoB and FtsE 
proteins (Escherichia coli). It also implied that two genes (B65D and B65E) 
might encode a set of two-component regulatory proteins and that the B65F gene 
might encode a protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family. Based 
on the features of the nucleotide sequence determined and the results of the 
homology search, the primary structure of the iol operon is predicted.

The pho regulon-dependent Ugp uptake system for glycerol-3-phosphate in 
Escherichia coli is trans inhibited by Pi.

sn-Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) or glyceryl phosphoryl phosphodiesters, the 
substrates of the phoB-dependent Ugp transport system, when transported 
exclusively through this system, can serve as a sole source of phosphate but not 
as a sole source of carbon (H. Schweizer, M. Argast, and W. Boos, J. Bacteriol. 
150:1154-1163, 1982). In order to explain this phenomenon, we tested two 
possibilities: repression of the pho regulon by Ugp-mediated transport and 
feedback inhibition by internal G3P or its degradation product Pi. Using an 
ugp-lacZ fusion, we found that the expression of ugp does not decline upon 
exposure to G3P, in contrast to the repressing effect of transport of Pi via the 
Pst system. This indicated that the Ugp system becomes inhibited after the 
uptake and metabolism of G3P. Using 32P-labeled G3P, we observed that little Pi 
is released by cells taking up G3P via the Ugp system but large amounts of Pi 
are released when the cells are taking up G3P via the GlpT system. Using a glpD 
mutant that could not oxidize G3P but which could still phosphorylate exogenous 
glycerol to G3P after GlpF-mediated transport of glycerol, we could not find 
trans inhibition of Ugp-mediated uptake of exogenous 14C-G3P. However, when 
allowing uptake of Pi via Pst, we observed a time-dependent inhibition of 
14C-G3P taken up by the Ugp transport system. Inhibition was half maximal after 
2 min and could be elicited by Pi concentrations below 0.5 mM. Cells had to be 
starved for Pi in order to observe this inhibition. We conclude that the 
activity of the Ugp transport system is controlled by the level of internal 
phosphate.

Accumulation of sigmaS due to enhanced synthesis and decreased degradation in 
acidic phospholipid-deficient Escherichia coli cells.

and Engineering, Saitama University, Saitama, Japan.

The Escherichia coli pgsA3 mutation, which causes deficiency in acidic 
phospholipids, leads to a significant accumulation of sigma(S). This 
accumulation is partly accounted for by the higher transcription level of rpoS; 
however, it has also been suggested that the cells accumulate sigma(S) 
post-transcriptionally. We found that the level of the small regulatory RNA 
RprA, which is involved in the promotion of rpoS translation, is higher in pgsA3 
cells than in pgsA(+) cells. Induction of altered rpoS mRNA that does not depend 
on RprA in pgsA(+) cells did not increase the level of sigma(S) to the high 
level observed in pgsA3 cells, suggesting post-translational sigma(S) 
accumulation in the latter. The mRNA levels of clpX and clpP, whose products 
form a ClpXP protease that degrades sigma(S), were much reduced in pgsA3 cells. 
Consistent with the reduced mRNA levels, the half-life of sigma(S) in pgsA3 
cells was much longer than in pgsA(+) cells, indicating that downregulation of 
the degradation is a major cause for the high sigma(S) content. We show that the 
downregulation can be partially attributed to activated CpxAR in the mutant 
cells, which causes repression of rpoE on whose gene product the expression of 
clpPX depends.

The thermal stress response of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga 
maritima was characterized using a 407-open reading frame-targeted cDNA 
microarray. Transient gene expression was followed for 90 min, following a shift 
from 80 degrees C to 90 degrees C. While some aspects of mesophilic heat-shock 
response were conserved in T. maritima, genome content suggested differentiating 
features that were borne out by transcriptional analysis. Early induction of 
predicted heat-shock operons hrcA-grpE-dnaJ (TM0851-TM0850-TM0849), groES-groEL 
(TM0505-TM0506), and dnaK-sHSP (TM0373-TM0374) was consistent with conserved 
CIRCE elements upstream of hrcA and groES. Induction of the T. maritima rpoE/ 
sigW and rpoD/ sigA homologs suggests a mechanism for global heat-shock response 
in the absence of an identifiable ortholog to a major heat-shock sigma factor. 
In contrast to heat-shock response in Escherichia coli, the majority of genes 
encoding ATP-dependent proteases were downregulated, including clpP (TM0695), 
clpQ (TM0521), clpY (TM0522), lonA (TM1633), and lonB (TM1869). Notably, T. 
maritima showed indications of a late heat-shock response with the induction of 
a marR homolog (TM0816), several other putative transcriptional regulators 
(TM1023, TM1069), and two alpha-glucosidases (TM0434 and TM1068). Taken 
together, the results reported here indicate that, while T. maritima shares core 
elements of the bacterial heat-shock response with mesophiles, the thermal 
stress regulatory strategies of this organism differ significantly. However, it 
remains to be elucidated whether these differences are related to 
thermophilicity or phylogenetic placement.

Modulating substrate choice: the SspB adaptor delivers a regulator of the 
extracytoplasmic-stress response to the AAA+ protease ClpXP for degradation.

Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.

Adaptor proteins help proteases modulate substrate choice, ensuring that 
appropriate proteins are degraded at the proper time and place. SspB is an 
adaptor that delivers ssrA-tagged proteins to the AAA+ protease ClpXP for 
degradation. To identify new SspB-regulated substrates, we examined proteins 
captured by ClpXP(trap) in sspB(+) but not sspB(-) strains. RseA(1-108), a 
fragment of a transmembrane protein that regulates the extracytoplasmic-stress 
response, fits this criterion. In response to stress, RseA is cleaved on each 
side of the membrane and is released as a cytoplasmic fragment that remains 
bound in an inhibitory complex with the sigma(E) transcription factor. Trapping 
experiments together with biochemical studies show that ClpXP functions in 
concert with SspB to efficiently recognize and degrade RseA(1-108), and thereby 
releases sigma(E). Genetic studies confirm that ClpX and SspB participate in 
induction of the sigma(E) regulon in vivo, acting at the final step of an 
activating proteolytic cascade. Surprisingly, the SspB-recognition sequence in 
RseA(1-108) is unrelated to its binding sequence in the ssrA tag. Thus, these 
experiments elucidate the final steps in induction of the extracytoplasmic 
stress response and reveal that SspB delivers a broader spectrum of substrates 
to ClpXP than has been recognized.

Accumulation of sigmaS due to enhanced synthesis and decreased degradation in 
acidic phospholipid-deficient Escherichia coli cells.

and Engineering, Saitama University, Saitama, Japan.

The Escherichia coli pgsA3 mutation, which causes deficiency in acidic 
phospholipids, leads to a significant accumulation of sigma(S). This 
accumulation is partly accounted for by the higher transcription level of rpoS; 
however, it has also been suggested that the cells accumulate sigma(S) 
post-transcriptionally. We found that the level of the small regulatory RNA 
RprA, which is involved in the promotion of rpoS translation, is higher in pgsA3 
cells than in pgsA(+) cells. Induction of altered rpoS mRNA that does not depend 
on RprA in pgsA(+) cells did not increase the level of sigma(S) to the high 
level observed in pgsA3 cells, suggesting post-translational sigma(S) 
accumulation in the latter. The mRNA levels of clpX and clpP, whose products 
form a ClpXP protease that degrades sigma(S), were much reduced in pgsA3 cells. 
Consistent with the reduced mRNA levels, the half-life of sigma(S) in pgsA3 
cells was much longer than in pgsA(+) cells, indicating that downregulation of 
the degradation is a major cause for the high sigma(S) content. We show that the 
downregulation can be partially attributed to activated CpxAR in the mutant 
cells, which causes repression of rpoE on whose gene product the expression of 
clpPX depends.

Copper is an essential micronutrient but is toxic at high concentrations. In 
Haemophilus influenzae mechanisms of copper resistance and its role in 
pathogenesis are unknown; however, our previous genetic screen by transposon 
insertion-site sequencing implicated a putative cation transporting ATPase 
(copA) in survival in a mouse lung infection model. Here, we demonstrate that H. 
influenzae copA (HI0290) is responsible for copper homeostasis involving the 
merR-type regulator, cueR, as well as six tandem copies of the metallochaperone 
gene, copZ. Deletion of the ATPase and metallochaperone genes resulted in 
increased sensitivity to copper but not to cobalt, zinc, or manganese. 
Nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) clinical isolate NT127 has the same locus 
organization but with three copies of copZ. We showed that expression of the 
NTHi copZA operon is activated by copper under the regulatory control of CueR. 
NTHi single copA and copZ mutants and, especially, the double deletion copZA 
mutant exhibited decreased copper tolerance, and the ΔcopZA mutant accumulated 
97% more copper than the wild type when grown in the presence of 0.5 mM copper 
sulfate. Mutants of NT127 deleted of the ATPase (copA) alone and deleted of both 
the ATPase and chaperones (copZ1-3) were 4-fold and 20-fold underrepresented 
compared to the parent strain during mixed-infection lung challenge, 
respectively. Complementation of cop locus deletion mutations restored copper 
resistance and virulence properties. NTHi likely encounters copper as a host 
defense mechanism during lung infection, and our results indicate that the cop 
system encodes an important countermeasure to alleviate copper toxicity.

Transition metals serve as an important class of micronutrients that are 
indispensable for bacterial physiology but are cytotoxic when they are in 
excess. Bacteria have developed exquisite homeostatic systems to control the 
uptake, storage, and efflux of each of biological metals and maintain a 
thermodynamically balanced metal quota. However, whether the pathways that 
control the homeostasis of different biological metals cross-talk and render 
cross-resistance or sensitivity in the host-pathogen interface remains largely 
unknown. Here, we report that zinc (Zn) excess perturbs iron (Fe) and copper 
(Cu) homeostasis in Escherichia coli, resulting in increased Fe and decreased Cu 
levels in the cell. Gene expression analysis revealed that Zn excess transiently 
up-regulates Fe-uptake genes and down-regulates Fe-storage genes and thereby 
increases the cellular Fe quota. In vitro and in vivo protein-DNA binding assays 
revealed that the elevated intracellular Fe poisons the primary Cu 
detoxification transcription regulator CueR, resulting in dysregulation of its 
target genes copA and cueO and activation of the secondary Cu detoxification 
system CusSR-cusCFBA Supplementation with the Fe chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl (DIP) 
or with the reducing agent GSH abolished the induction of cusCFBA during Zn 
excess. Consistent with the importance of this metal homeostatic network in cell 
physiology, combined metal treatment, including simultaneously overloading cells 
with both Zn (0.25 mm) and Cu (0.25 mm) and sequestering Fe with DIP (50 μm), 
substantially inhibited E. coli growth. These results advance our understanding 
of bacterial metallobiology and may inform the development of metal-based 
antimicrobial regimens to manage infectious diseases.

Although a variety of whole-cell biosensors and biosorbents have been developed 
for detection and removal of heavy metal contaminants, few whole cells can be 
applied to both monitoring and remediation of copper pollution in water. In this 
study, a modified plasmid was constructed by incorporating a copper-sensing 
element and a copper-adsorbing element into a temperature-inducible plasmid, 
pBV220. This plasmid was subsequently transformed into an engineered Escherichia 
coli strain lacking copA and cueO. This dual-functional E. coli cell selectively 
responded to copper ions with a linear detection range of 0.01-25 μM at 37 °C 
and could express surface-displayed CueR when treated at 42 °C without any 
costly chemical inducers. The display of CueR on the cell surface specifically 
enhanced its copper adsorption capacity and rapidly removed copper ions from 
aqueous solutions. In addition, the CueR surface-displayed cells could be 
regenerated by adsorption-desorption cycles via pH regulation. Moreover, by 
simply using two different temperatures, the detection or adsorption of copper 
using this dual-functional whole cell was achieved without any 
cross-interference. Most importantly, it provided highly sensitive, accurate 
quantification, and effective removal of copper in real environmental water 
samples. Thus, this E. coli cell can be used for large-scale detection and 
remediation of copper pollutants.

Metabolic Reprogramming of Vibrio cholerae Impaired in Respiratory NADH 
Oxidation Is Accompanied by Increased Copper Sensitivity.

The electrogenic, sodium ion-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NQR) 
from Vibrio cholerae is frequent in pathogenic bacteria and a potential target 
for antibiotics. NQR couples the oxidation of NADH to the formation of a sodium 
motive force (SMF) and therefore drives important processes, such as flagellar 
rotation, substrate uptake, and energy-dissipating cation-proton antiport. We 
performed a quantitative proteome analysis of V. cholerae O395N1 compared to its 
variant lacking the NQR using minimal medium with glucose as the carbon source. 
We found 84 proteins (regulation factor of ≥2) to be changed in abundance. The 
loss of NQR resulted in a decrease in the abundance of enzymes of the oxidative 
branch of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and an increase in abundance of 
virulence factors AcfC and TcpA. Most unexpected, the copper resistance proteins 
CopA, CopG, and CueR were decreased in the nqr deletion strain. As a 
consequence, the mutant exhibited diminished resistance to copper compared to 
the reference strain, as confirmed in growth studies using either glucose or 
mixed amino acids as carbon sources. We propose that the observed adaptations of 
the nqr deletion strain represent a coordinated response which counteracts a 
drop in transmembrane voltage that challenges V. cholerae in its different 
habitats.IMPORTANCE The importance of the central metabolism for bacterial 
virulence has raised interest in studying catabolic enzymes not present in the 
host, such as NQR, as putative targets for antibiotics. Vibrio cholerae lacking 
the NQR, which is studied here, is a model to estimate the impact of specific 
NQR inhibitors on the phenotype of a pathogen. Our comparative proteomic study 
provides a framework to evaluate the chances of success of compounds directed 
against NQR with respect to their bacteriostatic or bactericidal action.

Metals are essential to all organisms; accordingly, cells employ numerous genes 
to maintain metal homeostasis as high levels can be toxic. In the present study, 
the gene operons responsive to metal(loid)s were employed to generate bacterial 
cell-based biosensors to detect target metal(loid)s. The cluster of genes 
related to copper transport known as the cop-operon is regulated by the 
interaction between the copA promoter region (copAp) and CueR, turning on and 
off gene expression upon copper ion binding. Therefore, the detection of copper 
ions could be achieved by inserting a plasmid harboring the fusion of copAp and 
reporter genes, such as enzymes and fluorescent genes. However, copAp is not as 
strong a promoter as other metal-inducible promoters, such as znt-, mer-, and 
ars-operons; thereby, its sensitivity toward copper ions was not sufficient for 
quantification. To overcome this problem, we engineered Escherichia coli with a 
deletion of copA to interfere with copper export from cells. The engineered E. 
coli whole-cell bioreporter was able to detect copper ions at 0 to 10 μM in an 
aqueous solution. Most importantly, it was specific to copper among several 
tested heavy metal(loid)s. Therefore, it will likely be useful to detect copper 
in diverse environmental systems. Although additional improvements are still 
required to optimize the E. coli-based copper-sensing whole-cell bioreporters 
presented in this study, our results suggest that there is huge potential to 
generate whole-cell bioreporters for additional targets by molecular 
engineering.

Copper (Cu) is a key antibacterial component of the host innate immune system 
and almost all bacterial species possess systems that defend against the toxic 
effects of excess Cu. The Cu tolerance system in Gram-negative bacteria is 
composed minimally of a Cu sensor (CueR) and a Cu export pump (CopA). The cueR 
and copA genes are encoded on the chromosome typically as a divergent but 
contiguous operon. In Escherichia coli, cueR and copA are separated by two 
additional genes, ybaS and ybaT, which confer glutamine (Gln)-dependent acid 
tolerance and contribute to the glutamate (Glu)-dependent acid resistance system 
in this organism. Here we show that Cu strongly inhibits growth of a ∆copA 
mutant strain in acidic cultures. We further demonstrate that Cu stress impairs 
the pathway for Glu biosynthesis via glutamate synthase, leading to decreased 
intracellular levels of Glu. Addition of exogenous Glu rescues the ∆copA mutant 
from Cu stress in acidic conditions. Gln is also protective but this relies on 
the activities of YbaS and YbaT. Notably, expression of both enzymes is 
up-regulated during Cu stress. These results demonstrate a link between Cu 
stress, acid stress, and Glu/Gln metabolism, establish a role for YbaS and YbaT 
in Cu tolerance, and suggest that subtle changes in core metabolic pathways may 
contribute to overcoming host-imposed copper toxicity.

The Copper Efflux Regulator CueR Is Subject to ATP-Dependent Proteolysis in 
Escherichia coli.

Author information:
(1)Microbial Biology, Ruhr University Bochum Bochum, Germany.

The trace element copper serves as cofactor for many enzymes but is toxic at 
elevated concentrations. In bacteria, the intracellular copper level is 
maintained by copper efflux systems including the Cue system controlled by the 
transcription factor CueR. CueR, a member of the MerR family, forms homodimers, 
and binds monovalent copper ions with high affinity. It activates transcription 
of the copper tolerance genes copA and cueO via a conserved DNA-distortion 
mechanism. The mechanism how CueR-induced transcription is turned off is not 
fully understood. Here, we report that Escherichia coli CueR is prone to 
proteolysis by the AAA+ proteases Lon, ClpXP, and ClpAP. Using a set of CueR 
variants, we show that CueR degradation is not altered by mutations affecting 
copper binding, dimerization or DNA binding of CueR, but requires an accessible 
C terminus. Except for a twofold stabilization shortly after a copper pulse, 
proteolysis of CueR is largely copper-independent. Our results suggest that 
ATP-dependent proteolysis contributes to copper homeostasis in E. coli by 
turnover of CueR, probably to allow steady monitoring of changes of the 
intracellular copper level and shut-off of CueR-dependent transcription.

Iron and copper act synergistically to delay anaerobic growth of bacteria.

Author information:

USA.

Transition metals are known to cause toxic effects through their interaction 
with oxygen, but toxicity under anoxic conditions is poorly understood. Here we 
investigated the effects of iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) on the anaerobic growth 
and gene expression of the purple phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas 
palustris TIE-1. We found that Fe(II) and Cu(II) act synergistically to delay 
anaerobic growth at environmentally relevant metal concentrations. Cu(I) and 
Cu(II) had similar effects both alone and in the presence of ascorbate, a Cu(II) 
reductant, indicating that reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by Fe(II) is not 
sufficient to explain the growth inhibition. Addition of Cu(II) increased the 
toxicity of Co(II) and Ni(II); in contrast, Ni(II) toxicity was diminished in 
the presence of Fe(II). The synergistic anaerobic toxicity of Fe(II) and Cu(II) 
was also observed for Escherichia coli MG1655, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and 
Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003. Gene expression analyses for R. palustris 
identified three regulatory genes that respond to Cu(II) and not to Fe(II): 
homologs of cueR and cusR, two known proteobacterial copper homeostasis 
regulators, and csoR, a copper regulator recently identified in Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis. Two P-type ATPase efflux pumps, along with an F(o)F(1) ATP 
synthase, were also upregulated by Cu(II) but not by Fe(II). An Escherichia coli 
mutant deficient in copA, cus, and cueO showed a smaller synergistic effect, 
indicating that iron might interfere with one or more of the copper homeostasis 
systems. Our results suggest that interactive effects of transition metals on 
microbial physiology may be widespread under anoxic conditions, although the 
molecular mechanisms remain to be more fully elucidated.

    Mol Microbiol. 2013 Feb;87(3):447-54.

Periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases (Cu,Zn-SODs) are implicated in bacterial 
virulence. It has been proposed that some bacterial P(1B)-type ATPases supply 
copper to periplasmic cupro-proteins and such transporters have also been 
implicated in virulence. Here we show that either of two P(1B)-type ATPases, 
CopA or GolT, is needed to activate a periplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD (SodCII) in 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. A ΔcopA/ΔgolT mutant accumulates 
inactive Zn-SodCII which can be activated by copper-supplementation in vitro. In 
contrast, either single ATPase mutant accumulates fully active Cu,Zn-SodCII. A 
contribution of GolT to copper handling is consistent with its copper-responsive 
transcription mediated by DNA-binding metal-responsive activator GolS. The 
requirement for duplicate transcriptional activators CueR and GolS remains 
unclear since both have similar tight K(Cu). Mutants lacking periplasmic 
cupro-protein CueP also accumulate inactive Zn-SodCII and while CopA and GolT 
show functional redundancy, both require CueP to activate SodCII in vivo. 
Zn-SodCII is also activated in vitro by incubation with Cu-CueP and this 
coincides with copper transfer as monitored by electron paramagnetic resonance 
spectroscopy. These experiments establish a role for CueP within the copper 
supply pathway for Salmonella Cu,Zn-SodCII. Copper binding by CueP in this 
pathogen may confer protection of the periplasm from copper-mediated damage 
while sustaining vital cupro-enzyme activity.

The bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae requires colonizination of the human 
small intestine to cause cholera. The anaerobic and slightly acidic conditions 
predominating there enhance toxicity of low copper concentrations and create a 
selective environment for bacteria with evolved detoxifying mechanisms. We 
reported previously that the VCA0260, VCA0261 and VC2216 gene products were 
synthesized only in V. cholerae grown in microaerobiosis or anaerobiosis. Here 
we show that ORFs VCA0261 and VCA0260 are actually combined into a single gene 
encoding a 18.7 kDa protein. Bioinformatic analyses linked this protein and the 
VC2216 gene product to copper tolerance. Following the approach of 
predict-mutate and test, we describe for the first time, to our knowledge, the 
copper tolerance systems operating in V. cholerae. Copper susceptibility 
analyses of mutants in VCA0261-0260, VC2216 or in the putative 
copper-tolerance-related VC2215 (copA ATPase) and VC0974 (cueR), under aerobic 
and anaerobic growth, revealed that CopA represents the main tolerance system 
under both conditions. The VC2216-encoded periplasmic protein contributes to 
resistance only under anaerobiosis in a CopA-functional background. The locus 
tag VCA0261-0260 encodes a copper-inducible, CueR-dependent, periplasmic 
protein, which mediates tolerance in aerobiosis, but under anaerobiosis its role 
is only evident in CopA knock-out mutants. None of the genes involved in copper 
homeostasis were required for V. cholerae virulence or colonization in the mouse 
model. We conclude that copper tolerance in V. cholerae, which lacks orthologues 
of the periplasmic copper tolerance proteins CueO, CusCFBA and CueP, involves 
CopA and CueR proteins along with the periplasmic Cot (VCA0261-0260) and CopG 
(VC2216) V. cholerae homologues.

Transcriptional response of Escherichia coli upon exposure to external copper 
was studied using DNA microarray and in vivo and in vitro transcription assays. 
Transcription of three hitherto-identified copper-responsive genes, copA (copper 
efflux transporter), cueO (multicopper oxidase) and cusC (tripartite copper pump 
component) became maximum at 5 min after addition of copper sulphate, and 
thereafter decreased to the preshift levels within 30 min. Microarray analysis 
at 5 min after addition of copper indicated that a total of at least 29 genes 
including these three known genes were markedly and specifically affected (28 
upregulated and one downregulated). Transcription of the divergent operons, 
cusCFB and cusRS, was found to be activated by CusR, which bound to a CusR box 
between the cusC and cusR promoters. Except for this site, the CusR box was not 
identified in the entire E. coli genome. On the other hand, transcription of 
copA and cueO was found to be activated by another copper-responsive factor 
CueR, which bound to a conserved inverted repeat sequence, CueR box. A total of 
197 CueR boxes were identified on the E. coli genome, including the CueR box 
associated with the moa operon for molybdenum cofactor synthesis. At least 10 
copper-induced genes were found to be under the control of CpxAR two-component 
system, indicating that copper is one of the signals for activation of the CpxAR 
system. In addition, transcription of yedWV, a putative two-component system, 
was activated by copper in CusR-dependent manner. Taken together we conclude 
that the copper-responsive genes are organized into a hierarchy of the 
regulation network, forming at least four regulons, i.e. CueR, CusR, CpxR and 
YedW regulons. These copper-responsive regulons appear to sense and respond to 
different concentrations of external copper.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) has multiple copies of the chaperone-usher (CU) pili 
operon in five fimbria groups: CU pili, curli, type IV pili, type III secretion 
pili, and type IV secretion pili. Commensal E. coli K-12 contains 12 CU pili 
operons. Among these operons, Sfm is expressed by the sfmACDHF operon. 
Transcriptome analyses, reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR 
analyses reported that FimZ directly binds to and activates the sfmA promoter, 
transcribing sfmACDHF. In addition, FimZ regularly induces constant cell 
elongation in E. coli, which is required for F-type ATPase function. The 
bacterial two-hybrid system showed a specific interaction between FimZ and the α 
subunit of the cytoplasmic F1 domain of F-type ATPase. Studies performed using 
mutated FimZs have revealed two active forms, I and II. Active form I is 
required for constant cell elongation involving amino acid residues K106 and 
D109. Active form II additionally required D56, a putative phosphorylation site, 
to activate the sfmA promoter. The chromosomal fimZ was hardly expressed in 
parent strain but functioned in phoB and phoP double-gene knockout strains. 
These insights may help to understand bacterial invasion restricted host 
environments by the sfm γ-type pili.

Structural studies of membrane proteins remain a great experimental challenge. 
Functional reconstitution into artificial nanoscale bilayer disc carriers that 
mimic the native bilayer environment allows the handling of membrane proteins in 
solution. This enables the use of small-angle scattering techniques for fast and 
reliable structural analysis. The difficulty with this approach is that the 
carrier discs contribute to the measured scattering intensity in a highly 
nontrivial fashion, making subsequent data analysis challenging. Here, an 
elegant solution to circumvent the intrinsic complexity brought about by the 
presence of the carrier disc is presented. In combination with small-angle 
neutron scattering (SANS) and the D2O/H2O-based solvent contrast-variation 
method, it is demonstrated that it is possible to prepare specifically 
deuterated carriers that become invisible to neutrons in 100% D2O at the length 
scales relevant to SANS. These `stealth' carrier discs may be used as a general 
platform for low-resolution structural studies of membrane proteins using well 
established data-analysis tools originally developed for soluble proteins.

Enzymes from hyperthermophiles can be efficiently purified after expression in 
mesophilic hosts and are well-suited for crystallisation attempts. Two enzymes 
of histidine biosynthesis from Thermotoga maritima, 
N'-((5'-phosphoribosyl)-formimino)-5-aminoimidazol-4-carb oxamid ribonucleotide 
isomerase and the cyclase moiety of imidazoleglycerol phosphate synthase, were 
overexpressed in Escherichia coli, both in their native and 
seleno-methionine-labelled forms, purified by heat precipitation of host 
proteins and crystallised. 
N'-((5'-phosphoribosyl)-formimino)-5-aminoimidazol-4-carb oxamid ribonucleotide 
isomerase crystallised in four different forms, all suitable for X-ray structure 
solution, and the cyclase moiety of imidazoleglycerol phosphate synthase yielded 
one crystal form that diffracted to atomic resolution. The obtained crystals 
will enable the determination of the first three-dimensional structures of 
enzymes from the histidine biosynthetic pathway.

The antibacterial activity of extracts and isolated constituents (scopoletin, 
umckalin, 5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, 6,8-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, 
(+)-catechin, gallic acid and its methyl ester) of Pelargonium sidoides and 
Pelargonium reniforme (Geraniaceae), plant species used in folk medicine by the 
Southern African native population, was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, 
including 3 Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 
beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 1451) and 5 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia 
coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
Haemophilus influenzae). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied with 
the preparation of the extracts and microorganisms tested, from about 0.6 mg/ml 
for aqueous phases to over 10 mg/ml for crude Pelargonium extracts. With the 
exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially active compounds 
exhibited antibacterial activities with MICs of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. The 
results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of the titled 
Pelargonium species.

The E. coli anti-sigma factor Rsd: studies on the specificity and regulation of 
its expression.

Hofmann N(1), Wurm R, Wagner R.

Author information:
(1)Institut für Physikalische Biologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, 
Düsseldorf, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Among the seven different sigma factors in E. coli σ(70) has the 
highest concentration and affinity for the core RNA polymerase. The E. coli 
protein Rsd is regarded as an anti-sigma factor, inhibiting σ(70)-dependent 
transcription at the onset of stationary growth. Although binding of Rsd to 
σ(70) has been shown and numerous structural studies on Rsd have been performed 
the detailed mechanism of action is still unknown.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have performed studies to unravel the 
function and regulation of Rsd expression in vitro and in vivo. Cross-linking 
and affinity binding revealed that Rsd is able to interact with σ(70), with the 
core enzyme of RNA polymerase and is able to form dimers in solution. 
Unexpectedly, we find that Rsd does also interact with σ(38), the stationary 
phase-specific sigma factor. This interaction was further corroborated by gel 
retardation and footprinting studies with different promoter fragments and 
σ(38)- or σ(70)-containing RNA polymerase in presence of Rsd. Under competitive 
in vitro transcription conditions, in presence of both sigma factors, a 
selective inhibition of σ(70)-dependent transcription was prevailing, however. 
Analysis of rsd expression revealed that the nucleoid-associated proteins H-NS 
and FIS, StpA and LRP bind to the regulatory region of the rsd promoters. 
Furthermore, the major promoter P2 was shown to be down-regulated in vivo by 
RpoS, the stationary phase-specific sigma factor and the transcription factor 
DksA, while induction of the stringent control enhanced rsd promoter activity. 
Most notably, the dam-dependent methylation of a cluster of GATC sites turned 
out to be important for efficient rsd transcription.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results contribute to a better understanding of 
the intricate mechanism of Rsd-mediated sigma factor specificity changes during 
stationary phase.

Characterization of a bordetella pertussis diaminopimelate (DAP) biosynthesis 
locus identifies dapC, a novel gene coding for an N-succinyl-L,L-DAP 
aminotransferase.

The functional complementation of two Escherichia coli strains defective in the 
succinylase pathway of meso-diaminopimelate (meso-DAP) biosynthesis with a 
Bordetella pertussis gene library resulted in the isolation of a putative dap 
operon containing three open reading frames (ORFs). In line with the successful 
complementation of the E. coli dapD and dapE mutants, the deduced amino acid 
sequences of two ORFs revealed significant sequence similarities with the DapD 
and DapE proteins of E. coli and many other bacteria which exhibit 
tetrahydrodipicolinate succinylase and N-succinyl-L,L-DAP desuccinylase 
activity, respectively. The first ORF within the operon showed significant 
sequence similarities with transaminases and contains the characteristic 
pyridoxal-5'-phosphate binding motif. Enzymatic studies revealed that this ORF 
encodes a protein with N-succinyl-L,L-DAP aminotransferase activity converting 
N-succinyl-2-amino-6-ketopimelate, the product of the succinylase DapD, to 
N-succinyl-L,L-DAP, the substrate of the desuccinylase DapE. Therefore, this 
gene appears to encode the DapC protein of B. pertussis. Apart from the 
pyridoxal-5'-phosphate binding motif, the DapC protein does not show further 
amino acid sequence similarities with the only other known enzyme with 
N-succinyl-L,L-DAP aminotransferase activity, ArgD of E. coli.

An intracellular iron chelator pleiotropically suppresses enzymatic and growth 
defects of superoxide dismutase-deficient Escherichia coli.

Maringanti S(1), Imlay JA.

Author information:

USA.

Mutants of Escherichia coli that lack cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
exhibit auxotrophies for sulfur-containing, branched-chain, and aromatic amino 
acids and cannot catabolize nonfermentable carbon sources. A secondary-site 
mutation substantially relieved all of these growth defects. The requirement for 
fermentable carbon and the branched-chain auxotrophy occur because superoxide 
(O2-) leaches iron from the [4Fe-4S] clusters of a family of dehydratases, 
thereby inactivating them; the suppression of these phenotypes was mediated by 
the restoration of activity to these dehydratases, evidently without changing 
the intracellular concentration of O2-. Cloning, complementation, and sequence 
analysis identified the suppressor mutation to be in dapD, which encodes 
tetrahydrodipicolinate succinylase, an enzyme involved in diaminopimelate and 
lysine biosynthesis. A block in dapB, which encodes dihydrodipicolinate 
reductase in the same pathway, conferred similar protection. Genetic analysis 
indicated that the protection stems from the intracellular accumulation of 
tetrahydro- or dihydrodipicolinate. Heterologous expression in the SOD mutants 
of the dipicolinate synthase of Bacillus subtilis generated dipicolinate and 
similarly protected them. Dipicolinates are excellent iron chelators, and their 
accumulation in the cell triggered derepression of the Fur regulon and a large 
increase in the intracellular pool of free iron, presumably as a dipicolinate 
chelate. A fur mutation only partially relieved the auxotrophies, indicating 
that Fur derepression assists but is not sufficient for suppression. It seems 
plausible that the abundant internal iron permits efficient reactivation of 
superoxide-damaged iron-sulfur clusters. This result provides circumstantial 
evidence that the sulfur and aromatic auxotrophies of SOD mutants are also 
directly or indirectly linked to iron metabolism.

To generate a hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 (HEV-3)-specific monoclonal 
antibody (mAb), the Escherichia coli-expressed carboxy-terminal part of its 
capsid protein was used to immunise BALB/c mice. The immunisation resulted in 
the induction of HEV-specific antibodies of high titre. The mAb G117-AA4 of IgG1 
isotype was obtained showing a strong reactivity with the homologous E. coli, 
but also yeast-expressed capsid protein of HEV-3. The mAb strongly cross-reacted 
with ratHEV capsid protein derivatives produced in both expression systems and 
weaker with an E. coli-expressed batHEV capsid protein fragment. In addition, 
the mAb reacted with capsid protein derivatives of genotypes HEV-2 and HEV-4 and 
common vole hepatitis E virus (cvHEV), produced by the cell-free synthesis in 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cell lysates. 
Western blot and line blot reactivity of the mAb with capsid protein derivatives 
of HEV-1 to HEV-4, cvHEV, ratHEV and batHEV suggested a linear epitope. Use of 
truncated derivatives of ratHEV capsid protein in ELISA, Western blot, and a 
Pepscan analysis allowed to map the epitope within a partially surface-exposed 
region with the amino acid sequence LYTSV. The mAb was also shown to bind to 
human patient-derived HEV-3 from infected cell culture and to hare HEV-3 and 
camel HEV-7 capsid proteins from transfected cells by immunofluorescence assay. 
The novel mAb may serve as a useful tool for further investigations on the 
pathogenesis of HEV infections and might be used for diagnostic purposes. KEY 
POINTS: • The antibody showed cross-reactivity with capsid proteins of different 
hepeviruses. • The linear epitope of the antibody was mapped in a partially 
surface-exposed region. • The antibody detected native HEV-3 antigen in infected 
mammalian cells.

Phytochrome photoreceptors regulate vital adaptations of plant development, 
growth, and physiology depending on the ratio of red and far-red light. The 
light-triggered Z/E isomerization of a covalently bound bilin chromophore 
underlies phytochrome photoconversion between the red-absorbing Pr and 
far-red-absorbing Pfr states. Compared to bacterial phytochromes, the molecular 
mechanisms of signal propagation to the C-terminal module and its regulation are 
little understood in plant phytochromes, not least owing to a dearth of 
structural information. To address this deficit, we studied the Arabidopsis 
thaliana phytochrome A (AtphyA) at full length by cryo-electron microscopy 
(cryo-EM). Following heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, we optimized 
the solvent conditions to overcome protein aggregation and thus obtained 
photochemically active, near-homogenous AtphyA. We prepared grids for cryo-EM 
analysis of AtphyA in its Pr state and conducted single-particle analysis. The 
resulting two-dimensional class averages and the three-dimensional electron 
density map at 17 Å showed a homodimeric head-to-head assembly of AtphyA. 
Docking of domain structures into the electron density revealed a separation of 
the AtphyA homodimer at the junction of its photosensor and effector modules, as 
reflected in a large void in the middle of map. The overall architecture of 
AtphyA resembled that of bacterial phytochromes, thus hinting at commonalities 
in signal transduction and mechanism between these receptors. Our work paves the 
way toward future studies of the structure, light response, and interactions of 
full-length phytochromes by cryo-EM.

The assembly of ribosomal subunits is an essential prerequisite for protein 
biosynthesis in all domains of life. Although biochemical and biophysical 
approaches have advanced our understanding of ribosome assembly, our mechanistic 
comprehension of this process is still limited. Here, we perform an in vitro 
reconstitution of the Escherichia coli 50S ribosomal subunit. Late 
reconstitution products were subjected to high-resolution cryo-electron 
microscopy and multiparticle refinement analysis to reconstruct five distinct 
precursors of the 50S subunit with 4.3-3.8 Å resolution. These assembly 
intermediates define a progressive maturation pathway culminating in a late 
assembly particle, whose structure is more than 96% identical to a mature 50S 
subunit. Our structures monitor the formation and stabilization of structural 
elements in a nascent particle in unprecedented detail and identify the 
maturation of the rRNA-based peptidyl transferase center as the final critical 
step along the 50S assembly pathway.

α-Crystallin with two isoforms, αA-crystallin (HSPB4) and αB-crystallin (HSPB5), 
is found in eye lens, spleen, lung, kidney, cornea, skin, but also in brain. 
Several studies revealed roles of αA/αB-crystallin in regulating cell viability 
and protection in the central nervous system. We previously demonstrated that 
α-crystallin serves as an intracellular protectant in astrocytes. Compared to 
well-studied intracellular functions of α-crystallin, there is limited proof for 
the role of α-crystallin as extracellular protectant. In order to clarify 
protective effects of extracellular αA/αB-crystallin, we exposed astrocytes to 
the toxic agents, staurosporine or C2-ceramide, or serum-starvation in the 
presence of αA/αB-crystallin. Extracellular αA/αB-crystallin protected 
astrocytes from staurosporine- and C2-ceramide-induced cell death. In addition, 
extracellular αB-crystallin/HSPB5 effectively promoted astrocytes viability 
through phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTOR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 
(ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38) and c-Jun N-terminal 
kinases (JNK) signaling pathways under serum-deprivation. Furthermore, 
αB-crystallin/HSPB5 decreases the staurosporine-mediated cleavage of caspase 3 
through PI3K/Akt signaling preventing apoptosis of astrocytes. Thus, the current 
study indicates that extracellular αA/αB-crystallin protects astrocytes exposed 
to various harmful stimuli. Furthermore, application of αB-crystallin/HSPB5 to 
isolated rat brain mitochondria inhibits ROS generation induced by complex III 
inhibition with Antimycin A.

Single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently made significant 
progress in high-resolution structure determination of macromolecular complexes 
due to improvements in electron microscopic instrumentation and computational 
image analysis. However, cryo-EM structures can be highly non-uniform in local 
resolution and all structures available to date have been limited to resolutions 
above 3 Å. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the 70S ribosome from 
Escherichia coli in complex with elongation factor Tu, aminoacyl-tRNA and the 
antibiotic kirromycin at 2.65-2.9 Å resolution using spherical aberration 
(Cs)-corrected cryo-EM. Overall, the cryo-EM reconstruction at 2.9 Å resolution 
is comparable to the best-resolved X-ray structure of the E. coli 70S ribosome 
(2.8 Å), but provides more detailed information (2.65 Å) at the functionally 
important ribosomal core. The cryo-EM map elucidates for the first time the 
structure of all 35 rRNA modifications in the bacterial ribosome, explaining 
their roles in fine-tuning ribosome structure and function and modulating the 
action of antibiotics. We also obtained atomic models for flexible parts of the 
ribosome such as ribosomal proteins L9 and L31. The refined cryo-EM-based model 
presents the currently most complete high-resolution structure of the E. coli 
ribosome, which demonstrates the power of cryo-EM in structure determination of 
large and dynamic macromolecular complexes.

CTB-MPR is a fusion protein between the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) and the 
membrane-proximal region of gp41 (MPR), the transmembrane envelope protein of 
Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), and has previously been shown to induce 
the production of anti-HIV-1 antibodies with antiviral functions. To further 
improve the design of this candidate vaccine, X-ray crystallography experiments 
were performed to obtain structural information about this fusion protein. 
Several variants of CTB-MPR were designed, constructed and recombinantly 
expressed in Escherichia coli. The first variant contained a flexible GPGP 
linker between CTB and MPR, and yielded crystals that diffracted to a resolution 
of 2.3 Å, but only the CTB region was detected in the electron-density map. A 
second variant, in which the CTB was directly attached to MPR, was shown to 
destabilize pentamer formation. A third construct containing a polyalanine 
linker between CTB and MPR proved to stabilize the pentameric form of the 
protein during purification. The purification procedure was shown to produce a 
homogeneously pure and monodisperse sample for crystallization. Initial 
crystallization experiments led to pseudo-crystals which were ordered in only 
two dimensions and were disordered in the third dimension. Nanocrystals obtained 
using the same precipitant showed promising X-ray diffraction to 5 Å resolution 
in femtosecond nanocrystallography experiments at the Linac Coherent Light 
Source at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The results demonstrate the 
utility of femtosecond X-ray crystallography to enable structural analysis based 
on nano/microcrystals of a protein for which no macroscopic crystals ordered in 
three dimensions have been observed before.

We introduce a general hybrid approach for determining the structures of 
supramolecular assemblies. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data define the 
overall envelope of the assembly and rigid-body orientation of the subunits 
while solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) chemical shifts and 
distance constraints define the local secondary structure, protein fold and 
inter-subunit interactions. Finally, Rosetta structure calculations provide a 
general framework to integrate the different sources of structural information. 
Combining a 7.7-Å cryo-EM density map and 996 ssNMR distance constraints, the 
structure of the type-III secretion system needle of Shigella flexneri is 
determined to a precision of 0.4 Å. The calculated structures are 
cross-validated using an independent data set of 691 ssNMR constraints and 
scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. The hybrid model 
resolves the conformation of the non-conserved N terminus, which occupies a 
protrusion in the cryo-EM density, and reveals conserved pore residues forming a 
continuous pattern of electrostatic interactions, thereby suggesting a mechanism 
for effector protein translocation.

coli.

The acyl esterase Aes effectively inhibits the transcriptional activity of 
MalT-the central activator of maltose and maltodextrin utilizing genes in 
Escherichia coli. To provide better insight into the nature of the interaction 
between Aes and MalT, we determined two different crystal structures of Aes-in 
its native form and covalently modified by a phenylmethylsulfonyl moiety at its 
active site serine. Both structures show distinct space groups and were refined 
to a resolution of 1.8 Å and 2.3 Å, respectively. The overall structure of Aes 
resembles a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold, which is extended by a funnel-like cap 
structure that forms the substrate-binding site. The catalytic triad of Aes, 
comprising residues Ser165, His292, and Asp262, is located at the bottom of this 
funnel. Analysis of the crystal-packing contacts of the two different space 
groups as well as analytical size-exclusion chromatography revealed a 
homodimeric arrangement of Aes. The Aes dimer adopts an antiparallel contact 
involving both the hydrolase core and the cap, with its twofold axis 
perpendicular to the largest dimension of Aes. To identify the surface area of 
Aes that is responsible for the interaction with MalT, we performed a 
structure-based alanine-scanning mutagenesis to pinpoint Aes residues that are 
significantly impaired in MalT inhibition, but still exhibit wild-type 
expression and enzymatic activity. These residues map to a shallow slightly 
concave surface patch of Aes at the opposite site of the dimerization interface 
and indicate the surface area that interacts with MalT.

Dynamic enzyme docking to the ribosome coordinates N-terminal processing with 
polypeptide folding.

Newly synthesized polypeptides undergo various cotranslational maturation steps, 
including N-terminal enzymatic processing, chaperone-assisted folding and 
membrane targeting, but the spatial and temporal coordination of these steps is 
unclear. We show that Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase (MAP) 
associates with ribosomes through a charged loop that is crucial for 
nascent-chain processing and cell viability. MAP competes with peptide 
deformylase (PDF), the first enzyme to act on nascent chains, for binding sites 
at the ribosomal tunnel exit. PDF has extremely fast association and 
dissociation kinetics, which allows it to frequently sample ribosomes and ensure 
the processing of nascent chains after their emergence. Premature recruitment of 
the chaperone trigger factor, or polypeptide folding, negatively affect 
processing efficiency. Thus, the fast ribosome association kinetics of PDF and 
MAP are crucial for the temporal separation of nascent-chain processing from 
later maturation events, including chaperone recruitment and folding.

Visualizing evolution in real time to determine the molecular mechanisms of 
n-butanol tolerance in Escherichia coli.

Toxicity of products or feedstock components poses a challenge in the 
biocatalyst-based production of fuels and chemicals. The genetic determinants 
that are involved in increased resistance to an inhibitor form the adaptive 
landscape for the phenotype; so in order to engineer more robust biocatalysts, a 
better understanding of the adaptive landscape is required. Here, we used an 
adaptive laboratory evolution method called visualizing evolution in real time 
(VERT) to help map out part of the adaptive landscape of Escherichia coli 
tolerance to the biofuel n-butanol. VERT enables identification of adaptive 
events (population expansions triggered by adaptive mutants) via visualization 
of the relative proportions of different fluorescently-labeled cells. Knowledge 
of the occurrence of adaptive events allows for a more systematic isolation of 
adaptive mutants while simultaneously reducing the number of missed adaptive 
mutants (and the underlying adaptive mechanisms) that result from clonal 
interference during the course of in vitro evolution. Based on the evolutionary 
dynamics observed, clonal interference was found to play a significant role in 
shaping the population structure of E. coli during exposure to n-butanol, and 
VERT helped to facilitate the isolation of adaptive mutants from the population. 
We further combined adaptive laboratory evolution with genome shuffling to 
significantly enhance the desired n-butanol tolerance phenotype. Subsequent 
transcriptome analysis of the isolated adaptive mutants revealed different 
mechanisms of n-butanol resistance in different lineages. In one 
fluorescently-marked subpopulation, members of the Fur regulon were upregulated; 
which was not observed in the other subpopulation. In addition, genome 
sequencing of several adaptive mutants revealed the genetic basis for some of 
the observed transcriptome profiles. We further elucidated the potential role of 
the iron-related gene in n-butanol tolerance via overexpression and deletion 
studies and hypothesized that the upregulation of the iron-related genes 
indirectly led to modifications in the outer membrane, which contributed to 
enhanced n-butanol tolerance.

A modified pathway for the production of acetone in Escherichia coli.

A modified synthetic acetone operon was constructed. It consists of two genes 
from Clostridium acetobutylicum (thlA coding for thiolase and adc coding for 
acetoacetate decarboxylase) and one from Bacillus subtilis or Haemophilus 
influenzae (teII(srf) or ybgC, respectively, for thioesterase). Expression of 
this operon in Escherichia coli resulted in the production of acetone starting 
from the common metabolite acetyl-CoA via acetoacetyl-CoA and acetoacetate. The 
thioesterases do not need a CoA acceptor for acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolysis. Thus, 
in contrast to the classic acetone pathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum and 
related microorganisms which employ a CoA transferase, the new pathway is 
acetate independent. The genetic background of the host strains was crucial. 
Only E. coli strains HB101 and WL3 were able to produce acetone via the modified 
plasmid based pathway, up to 64mM and 42mM in 5-ml cultures, respectively. Using 
glucose fed-batch cultures the concentration could be increased up to 122mM 
acetone with HB101 carrying the recombinant plasmid pUC19ayt (thioesterase from 
H. influenzae). The formation of acetone led to a decreased acetate production 
by E. coli.

Iron acquisition in the dental pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans: 
what does it use as a source and how does it get this essential metal?

Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans requires iron to grow under limiting 
conditions imposed by synthetic and natural chelators. Although none of the 
strains tested used hemoglobin, lactoferrin or transferrin, all of them used 
FeCl3 and hemin as iron sources under chelated conditions. Dot-blot binding 
assays showed that all strains bind lactoferrin, hemoglobin, and hemin but not 
transferrin. When compared with smooth strains, the rough isolates showed higher 
hemin binding activity, which was sensitive to proteinase K treatment. A. 
actinomycetemcomitans harbors the Fur-regulated afeABCD locus coding for iron 
acquisition in isogenic and non-isogenic cell backgrounds. The genome of this 
oral pathogen also harbors several other predicted iron uptake genes including 
the hitABC locus, which restored iron acquisition in the E. coli 1017 ent 
mutant. However, the disruption of this locus in the parental strain did not 
affect iron acquisition as drastically as the inactivation of AfeABCD, 
suggesting that the latter system could be more involved in iron transport than 
the HitABC system. The genome of this oral pathogen also harbors an active copy 
of the exbBexbDtonB operon, which could provide the energy needed for hemin 
acquisition. However, inactivation of each coding region of this operon did not 
affect the hemin and iron acquisition phenotypes of isogenic derivatives. This 
observation suggests that the function of these proteins could be replaced by 
those coded for by tolQ, tolR and tolA as it was described for other bacterial 
transport systems. Interruption of a hasR homolog, an actively transcribed gene 
that is predicted to code for an outer membrane hemophore receptor protein, did 
not affect the ability of an isogenic derivative to bind and use hemin under 
chelated conditions. This result also indicates that A. actinomycetemcomitans 
could produce more than one outer membrane hemin receptor as it was described in 
other human pathogens. All strains tested formed biofilms on plastic under 
iron-rich and iron-chelated conditions. However, smooth strains attached poorly 
and formed weaker biofilms when compared with rough isolates. The incubation of 
rough cells in the presence of FeCl3 or hemin resulted in an increased number of 
smaller aggregates and microcolonies as compared to the fewer but larger 
aggregates formed when cells were grown in the presence of dipyridyl.

The tol-oprL region in Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be involved in pyocin 
uptake and required for cell viability. The complete nucleotide sequences of the 
tolQRA and oprL genes as well as the incomplete sequences of tolB and orf2 have 
been previously reported. In addition, the sequence of a P. aeruginosa 
iron-regulated gene (pig6) has been described and found to share homology with 
an open reading frame located upstream of the Escherichia coli tolQRA genes (U. 
A. Ochsner and M. L. Vasil, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:4409-4414, 1996). In 
this study, we cloned the remainder of the P. aeruginosa tol-oprL gene cluster 
and determined its nucleotide sequence. This cluster was found to consist of 
seven genes in the order orf1 tolQ tolR tolA tolB oprL orf2. Transcriptional 
analysis of this gene cluster was performed by detecting the presence of mRNAs 
spanning adjacent genes as well as by using a promoterless lacZ reporter gene 
fused to each of the seven genes contained in the tol-oprL locus. The results 
show that there are three major transcriptional units or operons in this region, 
orf1-tolQRA, tolB, and oprL-orf2, in contrast to the E. coli tol-pal region, 
where there are only two operons, orf1-tolQRA and tolB-pal-orf2. Analysis of 
gene expression indicated that the tol-oprL genes of P. aeruginosa are both iron 
and growth phase modulated. The first operon, orf1-tolQRA, is iron regulated 
throughout growth, but iron-regulated expression of tolB and oprL fusions occurs 
only in late log phase. The expression of the three operons was significantly 
less repressed by iron in fur mutants than in the wild-type strain, suggesting 
the involvement of Fur in the iron regulation of all three operons. RegA is a 
positive yet nonessential regulator of tol-oprL expression.

Effects of iron and temperature on expression of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
tolQRA genes: role of the ferric uptake regulator.

The tolQRA genes have been recently identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO. In 
this study, we examined the effect of iron and temperature on tolQRA expression. 
A promoterless lacZ gene was introduced downstream of plasmid-encoded tolQ and 
tolA, and expression was monitored by measuring beta-galactosidase activity of 
cultures. Addition of 25 microM FeCl3 to the culture medium reduced tolQRA 
expression by 50 to 60% in PAO but by only 25% in the fur mutant PAO A4. 
Northern hybridization analysis revealed that iron regulation occurs at the 
level of transcription and involves the P. aeruginosa ferric uptake regulator 
(Fur). Primer extension analysis was used to identify the proposed 
transcriptional start site of tolA. Although a putative Fur box was identified 
20 bp upstream of the proposed start site, purified Fur did not bind to the tolA 
or tolQR promoter regions in an in vitro gel retardation assay. Therefore, iron 
regulation of the tol genes appears to involve an intermediate regulatory gene. 
Expression of tolQR and tolA was optimal at 37 degrees C and was reduced by 40 
to 50% when cultures were grown at either 42 or 25 degreesC. Growth in high-iron 
medium at 25 degrees C further reduced tolQR and tolA expression.

Gene repression by the ferric uptake regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: cycle 
selection of iron-regulated genes.

Denver 80262, USA.

The expression of at least 24 distinct genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is 
under direct control of the "ferric uptake regulator" (Fur). Novel targets of 
the Fur protein were isolated in a powerful SELEX (systematic evolution of 
ligands by exponential enrichment)-like cycle selection consisting of in vitro 
DNA-Fur interaction, binding to anti-Fur antibody, purification on protein G, 
and PCR amplification. DNA fragments obtained after at least three exponential 
enrichment cycles were cloned and subjected to DNA mobility-shift assays and 
DNase I footprint analyses to verify the specific interaction with the Fur 
protein in vitro. Iron-dependent expression of the corresponding genes in vivo 
was monitored by RNase protection analysis. In total, 20 different DNA fragments 
were identified which represent actual Pseudomonas iron-regulated genes (PIGs). 
While four PIGs are identical to already known genes (pfeR, pvdS, tonB, and 
fumC, respectively), 16 PIGs represent previously unknown genes. Homology 
studies of the putative proteins encoded by the PIGs allowed us to speculate 
about their possible function. Two PIG products were highly similar to 
siderophore receptors from various species, and three PIG products were 
significantly homologous to alternative sigma factors. Furthermore, homologs of 
the Escherichia coli ORF1-tolQ, nuoA, stringent starvation protein Ssp, and of a 
two-component regulatory system similar to the Pseudomonas syringae LemA sensor 
kinase were identified. The putative gene products of seven additional PIGs did 
not show significant homologies to any known proteins. The PIGs were mapped on 
the P.aeruginosa chromosome. Their possible role in iron metabolism and 
virulence of P. aeruginosa is discussed.

Iron acquisition in the dental pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans: 
what does it use as a source and how does it get this essential metal?

Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans requires iron to grow under limiting 
conditions imposed by synthetic and natural chelators. Although none of the 
strains tested used hemoglobin, lactoferrin or transferrin, all of them used 
FeCl3 and hemin as iron sources under chelated conditions. Dot-blot binding 
assays showed that all strains bind lactoferrin, hemoglobin, and hemin but not 
transferrin. When compared with smooth strains, the rough isolates showed higher 
hemin binding activity, which was sensitive to proteinase K treatment. A. 
actinomycetemcomitans harbors the Fur-regulated afeABCD locus coding for iron 
acquisition in isogenic and non-isogenic cell backgrounds. The genome of this 
oral pathogen also harbors several other predicted iron uptake genes including 
the hitABC locus, which restored iron acquisition in the E. coli 1017 ent 
mutant. However, the disruption of this locus in the parental strain did not 
affect iron acquisition as drastically as the inactivation of AfeABCD, 
suggesting that the latter system could be more involved in iron transport than 
the HitABC system. The genome of this oral pathogen also harbors an active copy 
of the exbBexbDtonB operon, which could provide the energy needed for hemin 
acquisition. However, inactivation of each coding region of this operon did not 
affect the hemin and iron acquisition phenotypes of isogenic derivatives. This 
observation suggests that the function of these proteins could be replaced by 
those coded for by tolQ, tolR and tolA as it was described for other bacterial 
transport systems. Interruption of a hasR homolog, an actively transcribed gene 
that is predicted to code for an outer membrane hemophore receptor protein, did 
not affect the ability of an isogenic derivative to bind and use hemin under 
chelated conditions. This result also indicates that A. actinomycetemcomitans 
could produce more than one outer membrane hemin receptor as it was described in 
other human pathogens. All strains tested formed biofilms on plastic under 
iron-rich and iron-chelated conditions. However, smooth strains attached poorly 
and formed weaker biofilms when compared with rough isolates. The incubation of 
rough cells in the presence of FeCl3 or hemin resulted in an increased number of 
smaller aggregates and microcolonies as compared to the fewer but larger 
aggregates formed when cells were grown in the presence of dipyridyl.

The tol-oprL region in Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be involved in pyocin 
uptake and required for cell viability. The complete nucleotide sequences of the 
tolQRA and oprL genes as well as the incomplete sequences of tolB and orf2 have 
been previously reported. In addition, the sequence of a P. aeruginosa 
iron-regulated gene (pig6) has been described and found to share homology with 
an open reading frame located upstream of the Escherichia coli tolQRA genes (U. 
A. Ochsner and M. L. Vasil, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:4409-4414, 1996). In 
this study, we cloned the remainder of the P. aeruginosa tol-oprL gene cluster 
and determined its nucleotide sequence. This cluster was found to consist of 
seven genes in the order orf1 tolQ tolR tolA tolB oprL orf2. Transcriptional 
analysis of this gene cluster was performed by detecting the presence of mRNAs 
spanning adjacent genes as well as by using a promoterless lacZ reporter gene 
fused to each of the seven genes contained in the tol-oprL locus. The results 
show that there are three major transcriptional units or operons in this region, 
orf1-tolQRA, tolB, and oprL-orf2, in contrast to the E. coli tol-pal region, 
where there are only two operons, orf1-tolQRA and tolB-pal-orf2. Analysis of 
gene expression indicated that the tol-oprL genes of P. aeruginosa are both iron 
and growth phase modulated. The first operon, orf1-tolQRA, is iron regulated 
throughout growth, but iron-regulated expression of tolB and oprL fusions occurs 
only in late log phase. The expression of the three operons was significantly 
less repressed by iron in fur mutants than in the wild-type strain, suggesting 
the involvement of Fur in the iron regulation of all three operons. RegA is a

To initiate infection of Escherichia coli, phage fd uses its gene-3-protein 
(G3P) to bind first to an F pilus and then to the TolA protein at the cell 
surface. G3P is normally auto-inhibited because a tight interaction between the 
two N-terminal domains N1 and N2 buries the TolA binding site. Binding of N2 to 
the pilus activates G3P by initiating long-range conformational changes that are 
relayed to the domain interface and to a proline timer. We discovered that the 
23-28 loop of the N1 domain is critical for propagating these conformational 
signals. The analysis of the stability and the folding dynamics of G3P variants 
with a shortened loop combined with TolA interaction studies and phage infection 
experiments reveal how the contact between the N2 domain and the 23-28 loop of 
N1 is energetically linked with the interdomain region and the proline timer and 
how it affects phage infectivity. Our results illustrate how conformational 
transitions and prolyl cis/trans isomerization can be coupled energetically and 
how conformational signals to and from prolines can be propagated over long 
distances in proteins.

Infection of Escherichia coli by the filamentous phage fd starts with the 
binding of the N2 domain of the phage gene-3-protein to an F pilus. This 
interaction triggers partial unfolding of the gene-3-protein, cis → trans 
isomerization at Pro-213, and domain disassembly, thereby exposing its binding 
site for the ultimate receptor TolA. The trans-proline sets a molecular timer to 
maintain the binding-active state long enough for the phage to interact with 
TolA. We elucidated the changes in structure and local stability that lead to 
partial unfolding and thus to the activation of the gene-3-protein for phage 
infection. Protein folding and TolA binding experiments were combined with 
real-time NMR spectroscopy, amide hydrogen exchange measurements, and phage 
infectivity assays. In combination, the results provide a molecular picture of 
how a local unfolding reaction couples with prolyl isomerization not only to 
generate the activated state of a protein but also to maintain it for an 
extended time.

Structural and energetic basis of infection by the filamentous bacteriophage 
IKe.

Filamentous phage use the two N-terminal domains of their gene-3-proteins to 
initiate infection of Escherichia coli. One domain interacts with a pilus, and 
then the other domain binds to TolA at the cell surface. In phage fd, these two 
domains are tightly associated with each other, which renders the phage robust 
but non-infectious, because the TolA binding site is inaccessible. Activation 
for infection requires partial unfolding, domain disassembly and prolyl 
isomerization. Phage IKe infects E. coli less efficiently than phage fd. Unlike 
in phage fd, the pilus- and TolA-binding domains of phage IKe are independent of 
each other in stability and folding. The site for TolA binding is thus always 
accessible, but the affinity is very low. The structures of the two domains, 
analysed by X-ray crystallography and by NMR spectroscopy, revealed a unique 
fold for the N-pilus-binding domain and a conserved fold for the TolA-binding 
domain. The absence of an activation mechanism as in phage fd and the low 
affinity for TolA probably explain the low infectivity of phage IKe. They also 
explain why, in a previous co-evolution experiment with a mixture of phage fd 
and phage IKe, all hybrid phage adopted the superior infection mechanism of 
phage fd.

Reprogramming the infection mechanism of a filamentous phage.

Lorenz SH(1), Schmid FX.

When they infect Escherichia coli cells, the filamentous phages IF1 and fd first 
interact with a pilus and then target TolA as their common receptor. They use 
the domains N2 and N1 of their gene-3-proteins (G3P) for these interactions but 
differ in the mechanism of infection. In G3P of phage IF1, N1 and N2 are 
independent modules that are permanently binding-active. G3P of phage fd is 
usually in a closed state in which N1 and N2 are tightly associated. The TolA 
binding site is thus inaccessible and the phage incompetent for infection. 
Partial unfolding and prolyl isomerization must occur to abolish the domain 
interactions and expose the TolA binding site. This complex mechanism of phage 
fd could be changed to the simple infection mechanism of phage IF1 by 
reprogramming its G3P following physicochemical rules of protein stability. The 
redesigned phage fd was robust and as infectious as wild-type phage fd.

The filamentous phages fd and IF1 use different mechanisms to infect Escherichia 
coli.

The filamentous phage fd uses its gene 3 protein (G3P) to target Escherichia 
coli cells in a two-step process. First, the N2 domain of G3P attaches to an F 
pilus, and then the N1 domain binds to TolA-C. N1 and N2 are tightly associated, 
rendering the phage robust but noninfectious because the binding site for TolA-C 
is buried at the domain interface. Binding of N2 to the F pilus initiates 
partial unfolding, domain disassembly, and prolyl cis-to-trans isomerization in 
the hinge between N1 and N2. This activates the phage, and trans-Pro213 
maintains this state long enough for N1 to reach TolA-C. Phage IF1 targets I 
pili, and its G3P contains also an N1 domain and an N2 domain. The pilus-binding 
N2 domains of the phages IF1 and fd are unrelated, and the N1 domains share a 
31% sequence identity. We show that N2 of phage IF1 mediates binding to the I 
pilus, and that N1 targets TolA. Crystallographic and NMR analyses of the 
complex between N1 and TolA-C indicate that phage IF1 interacts with the same 
site on TolA-C as phage fd. In IF1-G3P, N1 and N2 are independently folding 
units, however, and the TolA binding site on N1 is permanently accessible. 
Activation by unfolding and prolyl isomerization, as in the case of phage fd, is 
not observed. In IF1-G3P, the absence of stabilizing domain interactions is 
compensated for by a strong increase in the stabilities of the individual 
domains. Apparently, these closely related filamentous phages evolved different 
mechanisms to reconcile robustness with high infectivity.

A conformational unfolding reaction activates phage fd for the infection of

Biowissenschaften Universität Bayreuth, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.

Unfolding usually leads to the loss of the biological function of a protein. 
Here, we show that an unfolding reaction activates the gene-3-protein of the 
filamentous phage fd for its function during the infection of Escherichia coli. 
Before infection, the gene-3-protein is in a fully folded locked form, in which 
the binding site for the phage receptor TolA is buried at the domain interface. 
To expose this binding site, the gene-3-protein must be activated, and 
previously we identified the cis-to-trans isomerization at Pro213 in the hinge 
region between the two domains as a key step of activation. We now report that 
Pro213 isomerization destabilizes the protein and leads to a loss of folded 
structure, presumably in the hinge region. The partially unfolded form of the 
gene-3-protein is metastable, and trans-Pro213 arrests the protein in this 
activated form for an extended time, long enough to find the receptor TolA. The 
partial unfolding and its timing by prolyl isomerization are essential for the 
biological function.

A proline switch controls folding and domain interactions in the gene-3-protein

The amino-terminal domains N1 and N2 of the gene-3-protein of phage fd form a 
bilobal structural and functional entity that protrudes from the phage tip. 
Domain N2 initiates the infection of Escherichia coli by binding to the F pilus. 
This binding results in the dissociation of the two domains and allows N1 to 
interact with the TolA receptor at the cell surface. The refolding of the N1-N2 
fragment begins with the folding of domain N1, which takes a few milliseconds, 
followed by the folding of domain N2, which is complete within five minutes. The 
subsequent domain assembly is unusually slow and shows a time-constant of 6200 s 
at 25 degrees C. We found that the rate of this reaction is controlled by the 
trans to cis isomerization of the Gln212-Pro213 bond in the hinge subdomain of 
N2, a region that provides many interactions between N1 and N2 in the 
gene-3-protein. The substitution of Pro213 by Gly accelerated domain association 
30-fold and revealed that the folding of the two individual domains and their 
assembly are indeed sequential steps in the refolding of the gene-3-protein. In 
the course of infection, the domains must separate to expose the binding site 
for TolA on domain N1. The kinetic block of domain reassembly caused by Pro213 
isomerization could ensure that after the initial binding of N2 to the F pilus 
the open state persists until N1 and TolA are close enough for their mutual 
interaction. Pro213 isomerization might thus serve as a slow conformational 
switch in the function of the gene-3-protein.

The gene-3 protein (G3P) of filamentous phages is essential for the infection of 
Escherichia coli. The carboxy-terminal domain anchors this protein in the phage 
coat, whereas the two amino-terminal domains N1 and N2 protrude from the phage 
surface. We analyzed the folding mechanism of the two-domain fragment N1-N2 of 
G3P (G3P(*)) and the interplay between folding and domain assembly. For this 
analysis, a variant of G3P(*) was used that contained four stabilizing mutations 
(IIHY-G3P(*)). The observed refolding kinetics extend from 10 ms to several 
hours. Domain N1 refolds very rapidly (with a time constant of 9.4 ms at 0.5 M 
guanidinium chloride, 25 degrees C) both as a part of IIHY-G3P(*) and as an 
isolated protein fragment. The refolding of domain N2 is slower and involves two 
reactions with time constants of seven seconds and 42 seconds. These folding 
reactions of the individual domains are followed by a very slow, 
spectroscopically silent docking process, which shows a time constant of 6200 
seconds. This reaction was detected by a kinetic unfolding assay for native 
molecules. Before docking, N1 and N2 unfold fast and independently, after 
docking they unfold slowly in a correlated fashion. A high energy barrier is 
thus created by domain docking, which protects G3P kinetically against 
unfolding. The slow domain docking is possibly important for the infection of 
E.coli by the phage. Upon binding to the F pilus, the N2 domain separates from 
N1 and the binding site for TolA on domain N1 is exposed. Since domain 
reassembly is so slow, this binding site remains accessible until pilus 
retraction has brought N1 close to TolA on the bacterial surface.

The gene-3-protein (G3P) of filamentous phage is essential for their 
propagation. It consists of three domains. The CT domain anchors G3P in the 
phage coat, the N2 domain binds to the F pilus of Escherichia coli and thus 
initiates infection, and the N1 domain continues by interacting with the TolA 
receptor. Phage are thus only infective when the three domains of G3P are 
tightly linked, and this requirement is exploited by Proside, an in vitro 
selection method for proteins with increased stability. In Proside, a repertoire 
of variants of the protein to be stabilized is inserted between the N2 and the 
CT domains of G3P. Stabilized variants can be selected because they resist 
cleavage by a protease and thus maintain the essential linkage between the 
domains. The method is limited by the proteolytic stability of G3P itself. We 
improved the stability of G3P by subjecting the phage without a guest protein to 
rounds of random in vivo mutagenesis and proteolytic Proside selections. 
Variants of G3P with one to four mutations were selected, and the temperature at 
which the corresponding phage became accessible for a protease increased in a 
stepwise manner from 40 degrees C to almost 60 degrees C. The N1-N2 fragments of 
wild-type gene-3-protein and of the four selected variants were purified and 
their stabilities towards thermal and denaturant-induced unfolding were 
determined. In the biphasic transitions of these proteins domain dissociation 
and unfolding of N2 occur in a concerted reaction in the first step, followed by 
the independent unfolding of domain N1 in the second step. N2 is thus less 
stable than N1, and it unfolds when the interactions with N1 are broken. The 
strongest stabilizations were caused by mutations in domain N2, in particular in 
its hinge subdomain, which provides many stabilizing interactions between the N1 
and N2 domains. These results reveal how the individual domains and their 
assembly contribute to the overall stability of two-domain proteins and how 
mutations are optimally placed to improve the stability of such proteins.

Antibody phage display is a key technology for the generation of recombinant 
(human) antibodies for research, diagnostics and therapy. Most antibody 
fragments can only be folded correctly in the oxidizing environment of the 
periplasm of Escherichia coli. A multitude of leader peptides has been used for 
secretion of antibody::pIII fusion proteins into the periplasm, but a systematic 
study of their impact on the performance of antibody phage display systems has 
not been reported so far. In this work we have analysed the influence of various 
leader peptides on antibody phage display efficiency and production yields of 
soluble antibody fragments. Four leader peptides using the Sec pathway (PelB, 
OmpA, PhoA and pIII) and three using the SRP pathway (DsbA, TorT and TolB) were 
compared. Both pathways are compatible with antibody phage display and the 
production of soluble antibody fragments. The applicability of the SRP pathway 
to antibody phage display and the production of functional scFvs is shown here 
for the first time.

The tol-oprL region in Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be involved in pyocin 
uptake and required for cell viability. The complete nucleotide sequences of the 
tolQRA and oprL genes as well as the incomplete sequences of tolB and orf2 have 
been previously reported. In addition, the sequence of a P. aeruginosa 
iron-regulated gene (pig6) has been described and found to share homology with 
an open reading frame located upstream of the Escherichia coli tolQRA genes (U. 
A. Ochsner and M. L. Vasil, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:4409-4414, 1996). In 
this study, we cloned the remainder of the P. aeruginosa tol-oprL gene cluster 
and determined its nucleotide sequence. This cluster was found to consist of 
seven genes in the order orf1 tolQ tolR tolA tolB oprL orf2. Transcriptional 
analysis of this gene cluster was performed by detecting the presence of mRNAs 
spanning adjacent genes as well as by using a promoterless lacZ reporter gene 
fused to each of the seven genes contained in the tol-oprL locus. The results 
show that there are three major transcriptional units or operons in this region, 
orf1-tolQRA, tolB, and oprL-orf2, in contrast to the E. coli tol-pal region, 
where there are only two operons, orf1-tolQRA and tolB-pal-orf2. Analysis of 
gene expression indicated that the tol-oprL genes of P. aeruginosa are both iron 
and growth phase modulated. The first operon, orf1-tolQRA, is iron regulated 
throughout growth, but iron-regulated expression of tolB and oprL fusions occurs 
only in late log phase. The expression of the three operons was significantly 
less repressed by iron in fur mutants than in the wild-type strain, suggesting 
the involvement of Fur in the iron regulation of all three operons. RegA is a 
positive yet nonessential regulator of tol-oprL expression.

Two isoforms of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) have been isolated as cDNA 
sequences from the hornwort Anthoceros agrestis. The encoded enzymes convert 
L-phenylalanine and to lower extents L-tyrosine and L-histidine. Thus, the 
functional presence of the general phenylpropanoid pathway in one of the 
earliest land plant groups is established. The hornwort Anthoceros agrestis has 
an elaborated phenolic metabolism resulting in phenolic compounds, such as 
rosmarinic acid or megacerotonic acid. The general phenylpropanoid pathway is 
involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds. Two phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 
(PAL) genes, AaPAL1 and AaPAL2, have been identified in Anthoceros agrestis and 
the protein with an N-terminal 6xHis-tag heterologously synthesized in 
Escherichia coli for a full biochemical characterization. Both PAL proteins 
accept L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine as well as L-histidine as substrates, 
although the activity is explicitly the highest with L-phenylalanine. Km values 
as well as catalytic efficiencies were determined for phenylalanine (Km AaPAL1 
39 µM, AaPAL2 18 µM) and tyrosine (Km AaPAL1 3.3 mM, AaPAL2 3.5 mM). In 
suspension cultures of Anthoceros agrestis, PAL genes were transcribed in 
parallel to rosmarinic acid (RA) accumulation and both showed highest abundance 
in the early growth phase. In a phylogenetic tree, both AaPAL amino acid 
sequences grouped within a clade with PAL amino acid sequences of diverse origin 
ranging from non-vascular to vascular plants, while most PALs from eudicots and 
monocots were mainly found in two other clades. The similarity of the hornwort 
PAL amino acid sequences to PAL sequences from vascular plants is more than 80% 
showing a strong conservation within the land plants. With this characterization 
of PALs from Anthoceros agrestis together with former investigations concerning 
cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase and 4-coumaric acid CoA-ligase, the functional 
presence of the general phenylpropanoid pathway in this hornwort is proven.

Evolution of antibiotic resistance in microbes is frequently achieved by 
acquisition of spontaneous mutations during antimicrobial therapy. Here, we 
demonstrate that inactivation of a central transcriptional regulator of iron 
homeostasis (Fur) facilitates laboratory evolution of ciprofloxacin resistance 
in Escherichia coli. To decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms, we first 
performed a global transcriptome analysis and demonstrated that the set of genes 
regulated by Fur changes substantially in response to antibiotic treatment. We 
hypothesized that the impact of Fur on evolvability under antibiotic pressure is 
due to the elevated intracellular concentration of free iron and the consequent 
enhancement of oxidative damage-induced mutagenesis. In agreement with 
expectations, overexpression of iron storage proteins, inhibition of iron 
transport, or anaerobic conditions drastically suppressed the evolution of 
resistance, whereas inhibition of the SOS response-mediated mutagenesis had only 
a minor effect. Finally, we provide evidence that a cell permeable iron chelator 
inhibits the evolution of resistance. In sum, our work revealed the central role 
of iron metabolism in the de novo evolution of antibiotic resistance, a pattern 
that could influence the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.

cell cultures.

Sorbus aucuparia cell cultures accumulate biphenyl and dibenzofuran phytoalexins 
in response to elicitor treatment. These polyketide derivatives arise from the 
starter substrate benzoyl-CoA, the biosynthesis of which is largely unresolved. 
Two CoA ligases involved are cinnamate:CoA ligase and benzoate:CoA ligase, which 
were assumed to be related in S. aucuparia to the ubiquitous 4-coumarate:CoA 
ligase (4CL). cDNAs encoding three distinct 4CLs from elicitor-treated S. 
aucuparia cell cultures were isolated using RT-PCR and RACE techniques and 
functionally expressed in Escherichia coli as His(6)-tagged proteins (Sa4CL2 and 
Sa4CL3) or GST-fusion protein (Sa4CL1). All three isoenzymes preferred 
4-coumaric acid over cinnamic acid in spectrophotometric assays and failed to 
utilize benzoic acid in radioisotopic assays. After elicitor treatment of S. 
aucuparia cell cultures, the transcript levels of all three Sa4CLs increased but 
were significantly lower than the maximum expression rates of the phenylalanine 
ammonia-lyase (PAL) and biphenyl synthase 1 (BIS1) genes. The substrate 
specificities and the expression profiles indicate that the three 4CL isoenzymes 
are not involved in benzoyl-CoA biosynthesis in S. aucuparia cell cultures. 
Sa4CL3 and PAL transcripts also accumulated in response to light treatment. 
Phylogenetically, Sa4CL1 and Sa4CL2 belong to the class I cluster and Sa4CL3 
groups in the class II cluster. Sa4CL3 contains a 49-amino acid N-terminal 
extension, which includes a chloroplast sorting signal.

Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis, Lamiaceae) is a well-known medicinal plant. 
Amongst the biologically active ingredients are a number of phenolic compounds, 
the most prominent of which is rosmarinic acid. To obtain better knowledge of 
the biosynthesis of these phenolic compounds, two enzymes of the general 
phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and 
4-coumarate:coenzyme A-ligase (4CL), were investigated in suspension cultures of 
lemon balm. MoPAL1 and Mo4CL1 cDNAs were cloned and heterologously expressed in 
Escherichia coli and the enzymes characterised. Expression analysis of both 
genes showed a correlation with the enzyme activities and rosmarinic acid 
content during a cultivation period of the suspension culture. Southern-blot 
analysis suggested the presence of most probably two gene copies in the M. 
officinalis genome of both PAL and 4CL. The genomic DNA sequences of MoPAL1 and 
Mo4CL1 were amplified and sequenced. MoPAL1 contains one phase 2 intron of 836 
bp at a conserved site, whilst Mo4CL1 was devoid of introns.

The non-conventional dimorphic thermo- and salt-resistant yeast Arxula 
adeninivorans has been developed as a host for heterologous gene expression. For 
assessment of the system two model genes have been selected: the GFP gene 
encoding the intracellular green fluorescent protein, and the HSA gene encoding 
the secreted human serum albumin. The expression system includes two host 
strains, namely A. adeninivorans LS3, which forms budding cells at 30 degrees C 
and mycelia at >42 degrees C, and the strain A. adeninivorans 135, which forms 
mycelia at temperatures as low as 30 degrees C. For expression control the 
constitutive A. adeninivorans-derived TEF1-promoter and S. cerevisiae-derived 
PHO5-terminator were selected. The basic A. adeninivorans 
transformation/expression vector pAL-HPH1 is further equipped with the 
Escherichia coli-derived hph gene conferring hygromycin B resistance and the 25S 
rDNA from A. adeninivorans for rDNA targeting. Transformants were obtained for 
both budding cells and mycelia. In both cell types similar expression levels 
were achieved and the GFP was localised in the cytoplasm while more than 95% of 
the HSA accumulated in the culture medium. In initial fermentation trials on a 
200-ml shake flask scale maximal HSA product levels were observed after 96 h of 
cultivation.

Expression of ecdysteroid receptor and ultraspiracle from Chironomus tentans 
(Insecta, Diptera) in E. coli and purification in a functional state.

Full length clones of ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP) from 
Chironomus tentans were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and purified 
by affinity chromatography. The absence of detergents during the purification 
procedure is essential for retaining receptor function, especially ligand 
binding. Presence of USP is mandatory for ligand binding to EcR, but no other 
cofactors or posttranslational modifications seem to be important, since 
Scatchard plots revealed the same characteristics (two high affinity binding 
sites for Ponasterone A with K(D1)=0.24+/-0.1nM and K(D2)=3.9+/-1.3.nM) as found 
in 0.4 M NaCl extracts of Chironomus cells. Gel mobility shift assays showed 
binding of the heterodimer to PAL and DR5 even after removal of the GST-tag, 
whereas EcR binding to PAL1 is GST-dependent. USP binds preferentially to DR5. 
Addition of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate improves ligand binding only 
slightly. Removal of GST has no effect on (3)H-ponasterone A binding, but alters 
DNA binding characteristics. Calculation of specific binding (5.3+3.0 nmol/mg 
GST EcR) revealed that 47+/-26% of purified receptor protein was able to bind 
ligand. The addition of purified EcR to cell extracts of hormone resistant 
subclones of the epithelial cell line from C. tentans, which have lost their 
ability to bind ligand, restores specific binding of (3)H-ponasterone A.

Cloning and characterization of the gene cluster for palatinose metabolism from 
the phytopathogenic bacterium Erwinia rhapontici.

Erwinia rhapontici is able to convert sucrose into isomaltulose (palatinose, 
6-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-D-fructose) and trehalulose 
(1-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-D-fructose) by the activity of a sucrose isomerase. 
These sucrose isomers cannot be metabolized by plant cells and most other 
organisms and therefore are possibly advantageous for the pathogen. This view is 
supported by the observation that in vitro yeast invertase activity can be 
inhibited by palatinose, thus preventing sucrose consumption. Due to the lack of 
genetic information, the role of sucrose isomers in pathogenicity has not been 
evaluated. Here we describe for the first time the cloning and characterization 
of the palatinose (pal) genes from Erwinia rhapontici. To this end, a 15-kb 
chromosomal DNA fragment containing nine complete open reading frames (ORFs) was 
cloned. The pal gene products of Erwinia rhapontici were shown to be homologous 
to proteins involved in uptake and metabolism of various sugars from other 
microorganisms. The palE, palF, palG, palH, palK, palQ, and palZ genes were 
oriented divergently with respect to the palR and palI genes, and sequence 
analysis suggested that the first set of genes constitutes an operon. Northern 
blot analysis of RNA extracted from bacteria grown under various conditions 
implies that the expression of the palI gene and the palEFGHKQZ genes is 
oppositely regulated at the transcriptional level. Genes involved in palatinose 
uptake and metabolism are down regulated by sucrose and activated by palatinose. 
Palatinose activation is inhibited by sucrose. Functional expression of palI and 
palQ in Escherichia coli revealed sucrose isomerase and palatinase activity, 
respectively.

The tol-oprL region in Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be involved in pyocin

tolQRA and oprL genes as well as the incomplete sequences of tolB and orf2 have 
been previously reported. In addition, the sequence of a P. aeruginosa

an open reading frame located upstream of the Escherichia coli tolQRA genes (U. 
A. Ochsner and M. L. Vasil, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:4409-4414, 1996). In 
this study, we cloned the remainder of the P. aeruginosa tol-oprL gene cluster 
and determined its nucleotide sequence. This cluster was found to consist of 
seven genes in the order orf1 tolQ tolR tolA tolB oprL orf2. Transcriptional 
analysis of this gene cluster was performed by detecting the presence of mRNAs

fused to each of the seven genes contained in the tol-oprL locus. The results 
show that there are three major transcriptional units or operons in this region, 
orf1-tolQRA, tolB, and oprL-orf2, in contrast to the E. coli tol-pal region, 
where there are only two operons, orf1-tolQRA and tolB-pal-orf2. Analysis of 
gene expression indicated that the tol-oprL genes of P. aeruginosa are both iron 
and growth phase modulated. The first operon, orf1-tolQRA, is iron regulated 
throughout growth, but iron-regulated expression of tolB and oprL fusions occurs 
only in late log phase. The expression of the three operons was significantly 
less repressed by iron in fur mutants than in the wild-type strain, suggesting 
the involvement of Fur in the iron regulation of all three operons. RegA is a 
positive yet nonessential regulator of tol-oprL expression.

Structural and catalytic properties of the four phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 
isoenzymes from parsley (Petroselinum crispum Nym.).

Near-full-length cDNAs for the four phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) isoenzymes 
in parsley (Petroselium crispum Nym.) were cloned and the complete amino acid 
sequences deduced. Fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase were expressed 
in Escherichia coli, purified and cleaved. All of the resulting phenylalanine 
ammonia-lyase proteins, as well as the fusion proteins, were catalytically 
active. The turnover number of one selected isoenzyme, PAL-1, was estimated to 
be around 22 s-1 for each active site. In contrast to a certain degree of 
differential expression in various parts of parsley plants, the four 
phenylalanine ammonia-lyase isoenzymes exhibited very similar apparent Km values 
for L-phenylalanine (15-24.5 microM) as well as identical temperature (58 
degrees C) and pH (8.5) optima. All of them were competitively inhibited by 
(E)-cinnamate with similar efficiency (Ki values: 9.1-21.5 microM), lacked 
cooperative behaviour, and accepted L-tyrosine as a substrate with low affinity 
(Km values: 2.6-7.8 mM). These results suggest that the occurrence of multiple 
gene copies has a function other than encoding isoenzymes with different enzyme 
kinetic properties.

A genomic library of Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires 
disease in humans, was constructed in Escherichia coli K-12, and the recombinant 
clones were screened by immuno-colony blots with an antiserum raised against 
heat-killed L. pneumophila. Twenty-three clones coding for a Legionella-specific 
protein of 19 kDa were isolated. The 19-kDa protein, which represents an outer 
membrane protein, was found to be associated with the peptidoglycan layer both 
in L. pneumophila and in the recombinant E. coli clones. This was shown by 
electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis of bacterial cell membrane 
fractions with a monospecific polyclonal 19-kDa protein-specific antiserum. The 
protein was termed peptidoglycan-associated protein of L. pneumophila (Ppl). The 
corresponding genetic determinant, ppl, was subcloned on a 1.8-kb ClaI fragment. 
DNA sequence studies revealed that two open reading frames, pplA and pplB, 
coding for putative proteins of 18.9 and 16.8 kDa, respectively, were located on 
the ClaI fragment. Exonuclease III digestion studies confirmed that pplA is the 
gene coding for the peptidoglycan-associated 19-kDa protein of L. pneumophila. 
The amino acid sequence of PplA exhibits a high degree of homology to the 
sequences of the Pal lipoproteins of E. coli K-12 and Haemophilus influenzae.

There is increasing experimental evidence that ADP-ribosylation of host proteins 
is an important means to regulate gene expression of bacteriophage T4. 
Surprisingly, this phage codes for three different ADP-ribosyltransferases, gene 
products Alt, ModA, and ModB, modifying partially overlapping sets of host 
proteins. While gene product Alt already has been isolated as a recombinant 
protein and its action on host RNA polymerases and transcription regulation have 
been studied, the nucleotide sequences of the two mod genes was published only 
recently. Their mode of action in the course of the infection cycle and the 
consequences of the ADP-ribosylations catalyzed by these enzymes remain to be 
investigated. Here we describe the cloning of the genes, the overexpression, 
purification, and partial characterization of ADP-ribosyltransferases ModA and 
ModB. Both proteins seem to act independently, and the ADP-ribosyl moieties are 
transferred to different sets of host proteins. While gene product ModA, 
similarly to the Alt protein, acts also on the alpha-subunit of host RNA 
polymerase, the ModB activity serves another set of proteins, one of which was 
identified as the S1 protein associated with the 30S subunit of the E. coli 
ribosomes.

Activity of the molybdopterin-containing xanthine dehydrogenase of Rhodobacter 
capsulatus can be restored by high molybdenum concentrations in a moeA mutant 
defective in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis.

Mikroorganismen, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.

During the screening for Rhodobacter capsulatus mutants defective in xanthine 
degradation, one Tn5 mutant which was able to grow with xanthine as a sole 
nitrogen source only in the presence of high molybdate concentrations (1 mM), a 
phenotype resembling Escherichia coli mogA mutants, was identified. 
Unexpectedly, the corresponding Tn5 insertion was located within the moeA gene. 
Partial DNA sequence analysis and interposon mutagenesis of regions flanking R. 
capsulatus moeA revealed that no further genes essential for molybdopterin 
biosynthesis are located in the vicinity of moeA and revealed that moeA forms a 
monocistronic transcriptional unit in R. capsulatus. Amino acid sequence 
alignments of R. capsulatus MoeA (414 amino acids [aa]) with E. coli MogA (195 
aa) showed that MoeA contains an internal domain homologous to MogA, suggesting 
similar functions of these proteins in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum 
cofactor. Interposon mutants defective in moeA did not exhibit dimethyl 
sulfoxide reductase or nitrate reductase activity, which both require the 
molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) cofactor, even after addition of 1 mM 
molybdate to the medium. In contrast, the activity of xanthine dehydrogenase, 
which binds the molybdopterin (MPT) cofactor, was restored to wild-type levels 
after the addition of 1 mM molybdate to the growth medium. Analysis of 
fluorescent derivatives of the molybdenum cofactor of purified xanthine 
dehydrogenase isolated from moeA and modA mutant strains, respectively, revealed 
that MPT is inserted into the enzyme only after molybdenum chelation, and both 
metal chelation and Mo-MPT insertion can occur only under high molybdate 
concentrations in the absence of MoeA. These data support a model for the 
biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor in which the biosynthesis of MPT and MGD 
are split at a stage when the molybdenum atom is added to MPT.

A gene cluster consisting of homologs to Escherichia coli moaA, moeA, moaC and 
moaE, which encode enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of molybdopterin 
cofactor (MoCo), and to modA, modB and modC, which encode a high-affinity 
molybdate transporter, were identified on pAO1 of Arthrobacter nicotinovorans 
near genes of molybdopterin-dependent enzymes involved in nicotine degradation. 
This gene arrangement suggests a coordinated expression of the MoCo-dependent 
and the MoCo-biosynthesis genes and shows that catabolic plasmids may carry the 
transport and biosynthetic machinery for the synthesis of the cofactors needed 
for the functioning of the enzymes they encode. pAO1 MoeA functionally 
complemented E. coli moeA mutants. The overexpressed and purified protein, of 
molecular mass 44,500 Da, associated into high-molecular-mass complexes and 
spontaneously formed gels at concentrations above 1 mg/ml. Transmission electron 
microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that MoeA forms fibrilar 
structures. In the presence of Mg2+ MoeA exhibited ATPase activity (0.020 pmol 
ATP x pmol protein(-1) x min(-1)). ATP, ADP or AMP induced the disassembly of 
the MoeA fibers into aggregates. pAO1 MoeA shows 39% identity to the C-terminal 
domain of the rat neuroprotein gephyrin. Like gephyrin it binds to neurotubulin, 
but binds with preference to tubulin dimers.

Molecular analysis of the molybdate uptake operon, modABCD, of Escherichia coli 
and modR, a regulatory gene.

The nucleotide sequence of a 6.8-kb chromosomal subfragment of plasmid pHW100 
complementing an Escherichia coli modC (chlD) mutant has been determined. This 
DNA region encodes the genes of a high-affinity uptake system for molybdate 
arranged in an operon with the genes modABCD. Since the modA product has a 
signal peptide at the N-terminus it probably is the periplasmic binding-protein 
for molybdate. The products of modB (chlJ) and modC (chlD) have been described 
earlier as the inner membrane protein and the ATP-binding protein of the 
molybdate transport system, respectively. At present, there is no information on 
possible functions of the fourth gene of the operon, modD. Upstream of the mod 
operon, two other gene loci, termed modR and an open reading frame ORF6 could be 
identified. ModR shares homology with a molybdenum-pterin binding protein of 
Clostridium pasteurianum. ORF6 has extensive homology to ModC and other 
nucleotide-binding proteins of E. coli. Insertional inactivation of modR and 
ORF6 using a gentamicin resistance gene cartridge has no effect on molybdoenzyme 
activities, indicating that none of the two gene products is essential for 
molybdate uptake or molybdenum cofactor synthesis. However, by using a plasmid 
carrying a modA-lacZ gene fusion we observed that inactivation of modR releases 
repression of the mod operon independent of the molybdate concentration in the 
medium. This indicates that modR is a component of the mod operon regulation or 
the repressor itself.

The alternative, heterometal-free nitrogenase of Rhodobacter capsulatus is 
repressed by traces of molybdenum in the medium. Strains carrying mutations 
located downstream of nifB copy II were able to express the alternative 
nitrogenase even in the presence of high molybdate concentrations. DNA sequence 
analysis of a 5.5-kb fragment of this region revealed six open reading frames, 
designated modABCD, mopA, and mopB. The gene products of modB and modC are 
homologous to ChlJ and ChlD of Escherichia coli and represent an integral 
membrane protein and an ATP-binding protein typical of high-affinity transport 
systems, respectively. ModA and ModD exhibited no homology to known proteins, 
but a leader peptide characteristic of proteins cleaved during export to the 
periplasm is present in ModA, indicating that ModA might be a periplasmic 
molybdate-binding protein. The MopA and MopB proteins showed a high degree of 
amino acid sequence homology to each other. Both proteins contained a tandem 
repeat of a domain encompassing 70 amino acid residues, which had significant 
sequence similarity to low-molecular-weight molybdenum-pterin-binding proteins 
from Clostridium pasteurianum. Compared with that for the parental nifHDK 
deletion strain, the molybdenum concentrations necessary to repress the 
alternative nitrogenase were increased 4-fold in a modD mutant and 500-fold in 
modA, modB, and modC mutants. No significant inhibition of the heterometal-free 
nitrogenase by molybdate was observed for mopA mopB double mutants. The uptake 
of molybdenum by mod and mop mutants was estimated by measuring the activity of 
the conventional molybdenum-containing nitrogenase. Molybdenum transport was not 
affected in a mopA mopB double mutant, whereas strains carrying lesions in the 
binding-protein-dependent transport system were impaired in molybdenum uptake.

Global role for ClpP-containing proteases in stationary-phase adaptation of 
Escherichia coli.

Strasse 12-16, 14195 Berlin, Germany. weichart@zedat.fu-berlin.de

To elucidate the involvement of proteolysis in the regulation of 
stationary-phase adaptation, the clpA, clpX, and clpP protease mutants of 
Escherichia coli were subjected to proteome analysis during growth and during 
carbon starvation. For most of the growth-phase-regulated proteins detected on 
our gels, the clpA, clpX, or clpP mutant failed to mount the growth-phase 
regulation found in the wild type. For example, in the clpP and clpA mutant 
cultures, the Dps protein, the WrbA protein, and the periplasmic 
lysine-arginine-ornithine binding protein ArgT did not display the induction 
typical for late-stationary-phase wild-type cells. On the other hand, in the 
protease mutants, a number of proteins accumulated to a higher degree than in 
the wild type, especially in late stationary phase. The proteins affected in 
this manner include the LeuA, TrxB, GdhA, GlnA, and MetK proteins and alkyl 
hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC). These proteins may be directly degraded by ClpAP 
or ClpXP, respectively, or their expression could be modulated by a 
protease-dependent mechanism. From our data we conclude that the levels of most 
major growth-phase-regulated proteins in E. coli are at some point controlled by 
the activity of at least one of the ClpP, ClpA, and ClpX proteins. Cultures of 
the strains lacking functional ClpP or ClpX also displayed a more rapid loss of 
viability during extended stationary phase than the wild type. Therefore, 
regulation by proteolysis seems to be more important, especially in resting 
cells, than previously suspected.

The human hemofiltrate peptide HF6478, a putative serine proteinase inhibitor, 
which is part of the precursor protein LEKTI, was cloned, overexpressed, and 
purified. HF6478 contains two disulfide bridges with 1-4, 2-3 connectivity, 
sharing partial homology to Kazal-type domains and other serine proteinase 
inhibitors. It was expressed as thioredoxin (Trx) fusion protein, and disulfide 
formation occurred in the oxidative cytoplasm of Escherichia coli Origami (DE3) 
strain which carries a trxB(-)/gor522(-) double mutation. The soluble fusion 
protein was purified using metal-chelating affinity chromatography. Cleavage of 
the Trx fusion protein with factor Xa and subsequent purification yielded the 
final product in amounts sufficient for structural studies. Characterization of 
recombinant HF6478 was done by amino acid sequencing, mass spectrometry, 
capillary zone electrophoresis, and CD spectroscopy. Taking the blood filtrate 
peptide HF6478 as example, we present a strategy which should facilitate the 
expression of different extracellular proteins in the E. coli cytoplasm.

PerR controls oxidative stress resistance and iron storage proteins and is 
required for virulence in Staphylococcus aureus.

Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, England.

The Staphylococcus aureus genome encodes three ferric uptake regulator (Fur) 
homologues: Fur, PerR, and Zur. To determine the exact role of PerR, we 
inactivated the gene by allelic replacement using a kanamycin cassette, creating 
strain MJH001 (perR). PerR was found to control transcription of the genes 
encoding the oxidative stress resistance proteins catalase (KatA), alkyl 
hydroperoxide reductase (AhpCF), bacterioferritin comigratory protein (Bcp), and 
thioredoxin reductase (TrxB). Furthermore, PerR regulates transcription of the 
genes encoding the iron storage proteins ferritin (Ftn) and the ferritin-like 
Dps homologue, MrgA. Transcription of perR was autoregulated, and PerR repressed 
transcription of the iron homeostasis regulator Fur, which is a positive 
regulator of catalase expression. PerR functions as a manganese-dependent, 
transcriptional repressor of the identified regulon. Elevated iron 
concentrations produced induction of the PerR regulon. PerR may act as a 
peroxide sensor, since addition of external hydrogen peroxide to 8325-4 (wild 
type) resulted in increased transcription of most of the PerR regulon, except 
for fur and perR itself. The PerR-regulated katA gene encodes the sole catalase 
of S. aureus, which is an important starvation survival determinant but is 
surprisingly not required for pathogenicity in a murine skin abscess model of 
infection. In contrast, PerR is not necessary for starvation survival but is 
required for full virulence (P < 0.005) in this model of infection. PerR of S. 
aureus may act as a redox sentinel protein during infection, analogous to the in 
vitro activities of OxyR and PerR of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, 
respectively. However, it differs in its response to the metal balance within 
the cell and has the added capability of regulating iron uptake and storage.

Two closely linked genes encoding thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase in 
Clostridium litorale.

The genes encoding thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase of Clostridium litorale 
were cloned and sequenced. The thioredoxin reductase gene (trxB) encoded a 
protein of 33.9 kDa, and the deduced amino acid sequence showed 44% identity to 
the corresponding protein from Escherichia coli. The gene encoding thioredoxin 
(trxA) was located immediately downstream of trxB. TrxA and TrxB were each 
encoded by two gene copies, both copies presumably located on the chromosome. 
Like other thioredoxins from anaerobic, amino-acid-degrading bacteria 
investigated to date by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, thioredoxin from C. 
litorale exhibited characteristic deviations from the consensus sequence, e.g., 
GCVPC instead of WCGPC at the redox-active center. Using heterologous enzyme 
assays, neither thioredoxin nor thioredoxin reductase were interchangeable with 
the corresponding proteins of the thioredoxin system from E. coli. To elucidate 
the molecular basis of that incompatibility, Gly-31 in C. litorale thioredoxin 
was substituted with Trp (the W in the consensus sequence) by site-directed 
mutagenesis. The mutant protein was expressed in E. coli and was purified to 
homogeneity. Enzyme assays using the G31W thioredoxin revealed that Gly-31 was 
not responsible for the observed incompatibility with the E. coli thioredoxin 
reductase, but it was essential for activity of the thioredoxin system in C. 
litorale.

Glycine reductase of Clostridium litorale. Cloning, sequencing, and molecular

A 2.8-kb HindIII fragment, containing three open reading frames, has been cloned 
and sequenced from Clostridium litorale. The first gene grdA encoded the 
selenocysteine-containing protein PA of the glycine reductase complex, a protein 
of 159 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 16.7 kDa. The second gene 
(grdB) encoded the 47-kDa subunit of the substrate-specific selenoprotein PB 
glycine that is composed of 437 amino acids. The third gene contained the 
5'-region of the gene for thioredoxin reductase, trxB. All gene products shared 
high similarity with the corresponding proteins from Eubacterium 
acidaminophilum. In both genes grdA and grdB, the opal termination codon (TGA) 
was found inframe, indicating the presence of selenocysteine in both 
polypeptides. Northern-blot analysis showed that grdA and grdB are organized as 
one operon. Unlike Escherichia coli, no stable secondary structures of the 
corresponding mRNA were found immediately downstream of the UGA codons to direct 
an insertion of selenocysteine into the grdA and grdB transcripts of C. 
litorale. Instead, a secondary structure was identified in the 3'-untranslated 
region of grdB.

Synthetic competition between cytoplasmic folding and translocation of a soluble 
membrane protein domain.

Uhland K(1), Zander T, Ehrmann M.

(1)Fakultät für Biologie, Universität Konstanz, Germany.

In wild-type strains of Escherichia coli, alkaline phosphatase (AP), either when 
present as a soluble protein or when fused to a membrane protein, is only active 
after translocation to the periplasm. In thioredoxin reductase (trxB) mutants, 
however, cytoplasmically localized AP can form disulphide bonds and can reach an 
active conformation. Once it has folded in the cytoplasm, it can no longer be 
translocated. On the other hand, when AP is fused to periplasmic domains of a 
membrane protein, translocation can be more rapid than folding. Thus, expressing 
hybrids of AP and integral membrane proteins in a trxB mutant generates 
competition between folding of AP in the cytoplasm and its translocation to the 
periplasm. The cellular localization of AP can be monitored in phosphoserine 
phosphatase (serB) mutants causing auxotrophy for L-serine. Cytoplasmically but 
not periplasmically localized AP can compensate for the lack of SerB, leading to 
growth on indicator plates. As expected, when AP was fused to cytoplasmic 
domains of membrane proteins, serB-mediated auxotrophy was abolished. 
Surprisingly, AP fusions to periplasmic domains exhibited a non-uniform response 
pattern. Fusions that translocate AP rapidly did not complement the SerB defect, 
while those that export AP only slowly could do so. The usefulness of these 
strains for studying a variety of aspects related to membrane protein biogenesis 
is discussed.

Components of glycine reductase from Eubacterium acidaminophilum. Cloning, 
sequencing and identification of the genes for thioredoxin reductase, 
thioredoxin and selenoprotein PA.

Lübbers M(1), Andreesen JR.

(1)Institut für Mikrobiologie, Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Germany.

The genes encoding thioredoxin reductase (trxB), thioredoxin (trxA), protein PA 
of glycine reductase (grdA) and the first 23 amino acids of the large subunit of 
protein PC of glycine reductase (grdC) belonging to the reductive deamination 
systems present in Eubacterium acidaminophilum were cloned and sequenced. The 
proteins were products of closely linked genes with 314 codons (thioredoxin 
reductase), 110 codons (thioredoxin), and 158 codons (protein PA). The protein 
previously called 'atypically small lipoamide dehydrogenase' or 'electron 
transferring flavoprotein' could now conclusively be identified as a thioredoxin 
reductase (subunit mass of 34781 Da) by the alignment with the enzyme of 
Escherichia coli showing the same typical order of the corresponding domains. 
The thioredoxin (molecular mass of 11742 Da) deviated considerably from the 
known consensus sequence, even in the most strongly conserved redox-active 
segment WCGPC that was now GCVPC. The selenocysteine of protein PA (molecular 
mass of 16609 Da) was encoded by TGA. The protein was highly similar to those of 
Clostridium purinolyticum and Clostridium sticklandii involved in glycine 
reductase. Thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin of E. acidaminophilum could be 
successfully expressed in E. coli.

Escherichia coli possesses iron transporters specific for either Fe2+ or Fe3+. 
Although Fe2+ is far more soluble than Fe3+, it rapidly oxidizes aerobically at 
pH > or = 7. Thus, FeoAB, the major Fe2+ transporter of E. coli, operates 
anaerobically. However, Fe2+ remains stable aerobically under acidic conditions, 
although a low-pH Fe2+ importer has not been previously identified. Here we show 
that ycdNOB (efeUOB) specifies the first such transporter. efeUOB is repressed 
at high pH by CpxAR, and is Fe2+-Fur repressed. EfeU is homologous to the 
high-affinity iron permease, Ftr1p, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi. 
EfeO is periplasmic with a cupredoxin N-terminal domain; EfeB is also 
periplasmic and is haem peroxidase-like. All three Efe proteins are required for 
Efe function. The efeU gene of E. coli K-12 is cryptic due to a frameshift 
mutation - repair of the single-base-pair deletion generates a functional EfeUOB 
system. In contrast, the efeUOB operon of the enterohaemorrhagic strain, 
O157:H7, lacks any frameshift and is functional. A 'wild-type' K-12 strain 
bearing a functional EfeUOB displays a major growth advantage under aerobic, 
low-pH, low-iron conditions when a competing metal is provided. 55Fe transport 
assays confirm the ferrous iron specificity of EfeUOB.

A c-di-GMP-Based Switch Controls Local Heterogeneity of Extracellular Matrix 
Synthesis which Is Crucial for Integrity and Morphogenesis of Escherichia coli 
Macrocolony Biofilms.

The extracellular matrix in macrocolony biofilms of Escherichia coli is arranged 
in a complex large-scale architecture, with homogenic matrix production close to 
the surface, whereas zones further below display pronounced local heterogeneity 
of matrix production, which results in distinct three-dimensional architectural 
structures. Combining genetics, cryosectioning and fluorescence microscopy of 
macrocolony biofilms, we demonstrate here in situ that this local matrix 
heterogeneity is generated by a c-di-GMP-dependent molecular switch 
characterized by several nested positive and negative feedback loops. In this 
switch, the trigger phosphodiesterase PdeR is the key component for establishing 
local heterogeneity in the activation of the transcription factor MlrA, which in 
turn activates expression of the major matrix regulator CsgD. Upon its release 
of direct inhibition by PdeR, the second switch component, the diguanylate 
cyclase DgcM, activates MlrA by direct interaction. Antagonistically acting PdeH 
and DgcE provide for a PdeR-sensed c-di-GMP input into this switch and-via their 
spatially differentially controlled expression-generate the long-range vertical 
asymmetry of the matrix architecture. Using flow cytometry, we show 
heterogeneity of CsgD expression to also occur in spatially unstructured 
planktonic cultures, where it is controlled by the same c-di-GMP circuitry as in 
macrocolony biofilms. Quantification by flow cytometry also showed CsgDON 
subpopulations with distinct CsgD expression levels and revealed an additional 
fine-tuning feedback within the PdeR/DgcM-mediated switch that depends on 
c-di-GMP synthesis by DgcM. Finally, local heterogeneity of matrix production 
was found to be crucial for the tissue-like elasticity that allows for 
large-scale wrinkling and folding of macrocolony biofilms.

The green tea polyphenol EGCG inhibits E. coli biofilm formation by impairing 
amyloid curli fibre assembly and downregulating the biofilm regulator CsgD via 
the σ(E) -dependent sRNA RybB.

In bacterial biofilms, which are often involved in chronic infections, cells are 
surrounded by a self-produced extracellular matrix that contains amyloid fibres, 
exopolysaccharides and other biopolymers. The matrix contributes to the 
pronounced resistance of biofilms against antibiotics and host immune systems. 
Being highly inflammatory, matrix amyloids such as curli fibres of Escherichia 
coli can also play a role in pathogenicity. Using macrocolony biofilms of 
commensal and pathogenic E. coli as a model system, we demonstrate here that the 
green tea polyphenol epigallocatachin gallate (EGCG) is a potent antibiofilm 
agent. EGCG virtually eliminates the biofilm matrix by directly interfering with 
the assembly of curli subunits into amyloid fibres, and by triggering the σ(E) 
cell envelope stress response and thereby reducing the expression of CsgD - a 
crucial activator of curli and cellulose biosynthesis - due to csgD mRNA 
targeting by the σ(E) -dependent sRNA RybB. These findings highlight EGCG as a 
potential adjuvant for antibiotic therapy of biofilm-associated infections. 
Moreover, EGCG may support therapies against pathogenic E. coli that produce 
inflammatory curli fibres along with Shigatoxin.

Vertical stratification of matrix production is essential for physical integrity 
and architecture of macrocolony biofilms of Escherichia coli.

Bacterial macrocolony biofilms grow into intricate three-dimensional structures 
that depend on self-produced extracellular polymers conferring protection, 
cohesion and elasticity to the biofilm. In Escherichia coli, synthesis of this 
matrix - consisting of amyloid curli fibres and cellulose - requires CsgD, a 
transcription factor regulated by the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS, and 
occurs in the nutrient-deprived cells of the upper layer of macrocolonies. Is 
this asymmetric matrix distribution functionally important or is it just a 
fortuitous by-product of an unavoidable nutrient gradient? In order to address 
this question, the RpoS-dependent csgD promoter was replaced by a vegetative 
promoter. This re-wiring of csgD led to CsgD and matrix production in both 
strata of macrocolonies, with the lower layer transforming into a rigid 'base 
plate' of growing yet curli-connected cells. As a result, the two strata broke 
apart followed by desiccation and exfoliation of the top layer. By contrast, 
matrix-free cells at the bottom of wild-type macrocolonies maintain colony 
contact with the humid agar support by flexibly filling the space that opens up 
under buckling areas of the macrocolony. Precisely regulated stratification in 
matrix-free and matrix-producing cell layers is thus essential for the physical 
integrity and architecture of E. coli macrocolony biofilms.

Amyloid curli fibers and cellulose are extracellular matrix components produced 
in the stationary phase top layer of E. coli macrocolonies, which confer 
physical protection, strong cohesion, elasticity, and wrinkled morphology to 
these biofilms. Curli and cellulose synthesis is controlled by a three-level 
transcription factor (TF) cascade with the RpoS sigma subunit of RNA polymerase 
at the top, the MerR-like TF MlrA, and the biofilm regulator CsgD, with two 
c-di-GMP control modules acting as key switching devices. Additional signal 
input and fine-tuning is provided by an entire series of small RNAs-ArcZ, DsrA, 
RprA, McaS, OmrA/OmrB, GcvB, and RydC--that differentially control all three TF 
modules by direct mRNA interaction. This review not only summarizes the 
mechanisms of action of these sRNAs, but also addresses the question of how 
these sRNAs and the regulators they target contribute to building the intriguing 
three-dimensional microarchitecture and macromorphology of these biofilms.

C-di-GMP-which is produced by diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and degraded by 
specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs)-is a ubiquitous second messenger in bacterial 
biofilm formation. In Escherichia coli, several DGCs (YegE, YdaM) and PDEs 
(YhjH, YciR) and the MerR-like transcription factor MlrA regulate the 
transcription of csgD, which encodes a biofilm regulator essential for producing 
amyloid curli fibres of the biofilm matrix. Here, we demonstrate that this 
system operates as a signalling cascade, in which c-di-GMP controlled by the 
DGC/PDE pair YegE/YhjH (module I) regulates the activity of the YdaM/YciR pair 
(module II). Via multiple direct interactions, the two module II proteins form a 
signalling complex with MlrA. YciR acts as a connector between modules I and II 
and functions as a trigger enzyme: its direct inhibition of the DGC YdaM is 
relieved when it binds and degrades c-di-GMP generated by module I. As a 
consequence, YdaM then generates c-di-GMP and-by direct and specific 
interaction-activates MlrA to stimulate csgD transcription. Trigger enzymes may 
represent a general principle in local c-di-GMP signalling.

Bacterial biofilms are highly structured multicellular communities whose 
formation involves flagella and an extracellular matrix of adhesins, amyloid 
fibers, and exopolysaccharides. Flagella are produced by still-dividing 
rod-shaped Escherichia coli cells during postexponential growth when nutrients 
become suboptimal. Upon entry into stationary phase, however, cells stop 
producing flagella, become ovoid, and generate amyloid curli fibers. These 
morphological changes, as well as accompanying global changes in gene expression 
and cellular physiology, depend on the induction of the stationary-phase sigma 
subunit of RNA polymerase, σ(S) (RpoS), the nucleotide second messengers cyclic 
AMP (cAMP), ppGpp, and cyclic-di-GMP, and a biofilm-controlling transcription 
factor, CsgD. Using flagella, curli fibers, a CsgD::GFP reporter, and cell 
morphology as "anatomical" hallmarks in fluorescence and scanning electron 
microscopy, different physiological zones in macrocolony biofilms of E. coli 
K-12 can be distinguished at cellular resolution. Small ovoid cells encased in a 
network of curli fibers form the outer biofilm layer. Inner regions are 
characterized by heterogeneous CsgD::GFP and curli expression. The bottom zone 
of the macrocolonies features elongated dividing cells and a tight mesh of 
entangled flagella, the formation of which requires flagellar motor function. 
Also, the cells in the outer-rim growth zone produce flagella, which wrap around 
and tether cells together. Adjacent to this growth zone, small chains and 
patches of shorter curli-surrounded cells appear side by side with flagellated 
curli-free cells before curli coverage finally becomes confluent, with 
essentially all cells in the surface layer being encased in "curli baskets."
IMPORTANCE: Heterogeneity or cellular differentiation in biofilms is a commonly 
accepted concept, but direct evidence at the microscale has been difficult to 
obtain. Our study reveals the microanatomy and microphysiology of an Escherichia 
coli macrocolony biofilm at an unprecedented cellular resolution, with 
physiologically different zones and strata forming as a function of known global 
regulatory networks that respond to biofilm-intrinsic gradients of nutrient 
supply. In addition, this study identifies zones of heterogeneous and 
potentially bistable CsgD and curli expression, shows bacterial curli networks 
to strikingly resemble Alzheimer plaques, and suggests a new role of flagella as 
an architectural element in biofilms.

Biofilm formation in Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria involves the 
inverse regulation of the synthesis of flagella and biofilm matrix components 
such as amyloid curli fibres, cellulose, colanic acid and 
poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PGA). Physiologically, these processes reflect the 
transition from growth to stationary phase. At the molecular level, they are 
tightly controlled by various sigma factors competing for RNA polymerase, a 
series of transcription factors acting in hierarchical regulatory cascades and 
several nucleotide messengers, including cyclic-di-GMP. In addition, a 
surprisingly large number of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) have been shown to 
directly or indirectly modulate motility and/or biofilm formation. This review 
aims at giving an overview of these sRNA regulators and their impact in biofilm 
formation in E. coli and Salmonella. Special emphasis will be put on sRNAs, that 
have known targets such as the mRNAs of the flagellar master regulator FlhDC, 
the stationary phase sigma factor σS (RpoS) and the key biofilm regulator CsgD 
that have recently been shown to act as major hubs for regulation by multiple 
sRNAs.

light-signalling pathway of Escherichia coli.

Escherichia coli senses blue light via the BLUF-EAL protein BluF (YcgF). The 
degenerate EAL domain of BluF does not have cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase 
activity, but BluF directly antagonizes the MerR-like repressor BluR (YcgE), 
which leads to expression of the ycgZ-ymgABC operon and activation of the Rcs 
system (Tschowri et al., 2009; Genes Dev 23: 522-534). While bluR, bluF and ycgZ 
have individual transcriptional start sites, comparative genome analysis 
indicates that the bluR-bluF-ycgZ-ymgAB region represents a functional unit in 
various enteric bacteria that is characterized by bluF alleles encoding 
degenerate EAL domains. Re-introducing conserved amino acids involved in 
phosphodiesterase activity of EAL domains did not restore enzymatic activity or 
c-di-GMP binding of BluF, but weakened its ability to antagonize BluR and 
improved a residual interaction with the BluR paralogue MlrA, which controls 
expression of the biofilm regulator CsgD and curli fibres. We identified the 
BluR binding site in the ycgZ promoter and observed that BluR also has residual 
affinity for the MlrA-dependent csgD promoter. Altogether, we propose that BluF 
evolved from a blue light-regulated PDE into a specific antagonist of a 
duplicate of MlrA that became BluR, which controls not only curli but various 
biofilm functions via the Ymg/Rcs pathway.

Targeting of csgD by the small regulatory RNA RprA links stationary phase, 
biofilm formation and cell envelope stress in Escherichia coli.

RprA is a small regulatory RNA known to weakly affect the translation of σ(S) 
(RpoS) in Escherichia coli. Here we demonstrate that csgD, which encodes a 
stationary phase-induced biofilm regulator, as well as ydaM, which encodes a 
diguanylate cyclase involved in activating csgD transcription, are novel 
negatively controlled RprA targets. As shown by extensive mutational analysis, 
direct binding of RprA to the 5'-untranslated and translational initiation 
regions of csgD mRNA inhibits translation and reduces csgD mRNA levels. In the 
case of ydaM mRNA, RprA base-pairs directly downstream of the translational 
start codon. In a feedforward loop, RprA can thus downregulate > 30 
YdaM/CsgD-activated genes including those for adhesive curli fimbriae. However, 
during early stationary phase, when csgD transcription is strongly activated, 
the synthesis of csgD mRNA exceeds that of RprA, which allows the accumulation 
of CsgD protein. This situation is reversed when csgD transcription is shut off 
- for instance, later in stationary phase or during biofilm formation - or by 
conditions that further activate RprA expression via the Rcs two-component 
system. Thus, antagonistic regulation of csgD and RprA at the mRNA level 
integrates cell envelope stress signals with global gene expression during 
stationary phase and biofilm formation.

Switching from the motile planktonic bacterial lifestyle to a biofilm existence 
is stimulated by the signalling molecule bis-(3'-5')-cyclic-diguanosine 
monophosphate (cyclic-di-GMP), which is antagonistically controlled by 
diguanylate cyclases (DGCs; characterized by GGDEF domains) and specific 
phosphodiesterases (PDEs; mostly featuring EAL domains). Here, we present the 
expression patterns of all 28 genes that encode GGDEF/EAL domain proteins in 
Escherichia coli K-12. Twenty-one genes are expressed in Luria-Bertani medium, 
with 15 being under sigma(S) control. While a small subset of GGDEF/EAL proteins 
(YeaJ and YhjH) is dominant and modulates motility in post-exponentially growing 
cells, a diverse battery of GGDEF/EAL proteins is deployed during entry into 
stationary phase, especially in cells grown at reduced temperature (28 degrees 
C). This suggests that multiple signal input into cyclic-di-GMP control is 
particularly important in growth-restricted cells in an extra-host environment. 
Six GGDEF/EAL genes differentially control the expression of adhesive curli 
fimbriae. Besides the previously described ydaM, yciR, yegE and yhjH genes, 
these are yhdA (csrD), which stimulates the expression of the DGC YdaM and the 
major curli regulator CsgD, and yeaP, which contributes to expression of the 
curli structural operon csgBAC. Finally, we discuss why other GGDEF/EAL 
domain-encoding genes, despite being expressed, do not influence motility and/or 
curli formation.

Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and 
physiology in bacteria. RyhB is an iron-responsive sRNA well characterized in 
Escherichia coli and conserved in other Enterobacteriaceae. In this study, we 
identified and characterized two RyhB homologs (named RyhB-1 and RyhB-2) in the 
fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri. We found that, as in other Enterobacteriaceae, 
both RyhB-1 and RyhB-2 are induced under iron starvation, repressed by the Fur 
regulator, and depend on Hfq for stability. Despite these similarities in 
expression, the mutant strains of Y. ruckeri lacking RyhB-1 (ΔryhB-1) or RyhB-2 
(ΔryhB-2) exhibited differential phenotypes. In comparison with the wild type, 
the ΔryhB-1 strain showed a hypermotile phenotype, reduced biofilm formation, 
increased replication rate, faster growth, and increased ATP levels in bacterial 
cultures. By contrast, in salmon cell cultures, the ΔryhB-1 strain exhibited an 
increased survival. On the other hand, the ΔryhB-2 strain was non-motile and 
showed augmented biofilm formation as compared to the wild type. The expression 
of a subset of RyhB conserved targets, selected from different bacterial 
species, was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in wild type, ΔryhB-1, ΔryhB-2, and 
ΔryhB-1 ΔryhB-2 strains cultured in iron-depleted media. RyhB-1 negatively 
affected the expression of most analyzed genes (sodB, acnA, sdhC, bfr, fliF, 
among others), whose functions are related to metabolism and motility, involving 
iron-containing proteins. Among the genes analyzed, only sdhC and bfr appeared 
as targets for RyhB-2. Taken together, these results indicate that Y. ruckeri 
RyhB homologs participate in the modulation of the bacterial physiology with 
non-redundant roles.

Aconitases (Acn) are iron-sulfur proteins that catalyse the reversible 
isomerization of citrate and isocitrate via the intermediate cis-aconitate in 
the Krebs cycle. Some Acn proteins are bi-functional and under conditions of 
iron starvation and oxidative stress lose their iron-sulfur clusters and become 
post-transcriptional regulators by binding specific mRNA targets. Many bacterial 
species possess two genetically distinct aconitase proteins, AcnA and AcnB. 
Current understanding of the regulation and functions of AcnA and AcnB in dual 
Acn bacteria is based on a model developed in Escherichia coli. Thus, AcnB is 
the major Krebs cycle enzyme expressed during exponential growth, whereas AcnA 
is a more stable, stationary phase and stress-induced enzyme, and both E. coli 
Acns are bi-functional. Here a second dual Acn bacterium, Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), has been analysed. Phenotypic traits of S. 
Typhimurium acn mutants were consistent with AcnB acting as the major Acn 
protein. Promoter fusion experiments indicated that acnB transcription was 
~10-fold greater than that of acnA and that acnA expression was regulated by the 
cyclic-AMP receptor protein (CRP, glucose starvation), the fumarate nitrate 
reduction regulator (FNR, oxygen starvation), the ferric uptake regulator (Fur, 
iron starvation) and the superoxide response protein (SoxR, oxidative stress). 
In contrast to E. coli, S. Typhimurium acnA was not induced in the stationary 
phase. Furthermore, acnA expression was enhanced in an acnB mutant, presumably 
to partially compensate for the lack of AcnB activity. Isolated S. Typhimurium 
AcnA protein had kinetic and mRNA-binding properties similar to those described 
for E. coli AcnA. Thus, the work reported here provides a second example of the 
regulation and function of AcnA and AcnB proteins in a dual Acn bacterium.

The tricarboxylic acid cycle in Shewanella oneidensis is independent of Fur and 
RyhB control.

BACKGROUND: It is well established in E. coli and Vibrio cholerae that strains 
harboring mutations in the ferric uptake regulator gene (fur) are unable to 
utilize tricarboxylic acid (TCA) compounds, due to the down-regulation of key 
TCA cycle enzymes, such as AcnA and SdhABCD. This down-regulation is mediated by 
a Fur-regulated small regulatory RNA named RyhB. It is unclear in the 
γ-proteobacterium S. oneidensis whether TCA is also regulated by Fur and RyhB.
RESULTS: In the present study, we showed that a fur deletion mutant of S. 
oneidensis could utilize TCA compounds. Consistently, expression of the TCA 
cycle genes acnA and sdhA was not down-regulated in the mutant. To explore this 
observation further, we identified a ryhB gene in Shewanella species and 
experimentally demonstrated the gene expression. Further experiments suggested 
that RyhB was up-regulated in fur mutant, but that AcnA and SdhA were not 
controlled by RyhB.
CONCLUSIONS: These cumulative results delineate an important difference of the 
Fur-RyhB regulatory cycle between S. oneidensis and other γ-proteobacteria. This 
work represents a step forward for understanding the unique regulation in S. 
oneidensis.

Mutants with defects in components of the glutathione-glutaredoxin (GSH/Grx) 
system of Rhodobacter capsulatus were constructed to study its role in defense 
against oxidative stress and the redox-dependent formation of photosynthetic 
complexes. The lack of the glutaredoxin 3 gene (grxC) or the glutathione 
synthetase B gene (gshB) resulted in lower growth rates under aerobic conditions 
and higher sensitivity to oxidative stress, confirming the role of the GSH/Grx 
system in oxidative stress defense. Both mutants are highly sensitive to 
disulfide stress, indicating a major contribution of the GSH/Grx system to the 
thiol-disulfide redox buffer in the cytoplasm. Like mutations in the thioredoxin 
system, mutations in the GSH/Grx system affected the formation of photosynthetic 
complexes, which is redox dependent in R. capsulatus. Expression of the genes 
grxC, gshB, grxA for glutaredoxin 1, and gorA for glutathione reductase, all 
encoding components of the GSH/Grx system, was not induced by oxidative stress. 
Other genes, for which a role in oxidative stress was established in Escherichia 
coli, acnA, fpr, fur, and katG, were strongly induced by oxidative stress in R. 
capsulatus. Mutations in the grxC, and/or gshB, and/or trxC (thioredoxin 2) 
genes affected expression of these genes, indicating an interplay of the 
different defense systems against oxidative stress. The OxyR and the SoxRS 
regulons control the expression of many genes involved in oxidative stress 
defense in E. coli in response to H2O2 and superoxide, respectively. Our data 
and the available genome sequence of R. capsulatus suggest that a SoxRS system 
is lacking but an alternative superoxide specific regulator exists in R. 
capsulatus. While the expression of gorA and grxA is regulated by H2O2 in E. 
coli this is not the case in R. capsulatus, indicating that the OxyR regulons of 
these two species are significantly different.

A small RNA regulates the expression of genes involved in iron metabolism in 
Escherichia coli.

5132, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

A small RNA, RyhB, was found as part of a genomewide search for novel small RNAs 
in Escherichia coli. The RyhB 90-nt RNA down-regulates a set of iron-storage and 
iron-using proteins when iron is limiting; it is itself negatively regulated by 
the ferric uptake repressor protein, Fur (Ferric uptake regulator). RyhB RNA 
levels are inversely correlated with mRNA levels for the sdhCDAB operon, 
encoding succinate dehydrogenase, as well as five other genes previously shown 
to be positively regulated by Fur by an unknown mechanism. These include two 
other genes encoding enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, acnA and fumA, two 
ferritin genes, ftnA and bfr, and a gene for superoxide dismutase, sodB. Fur 
positive regulation of all these genes is fully reversed in an ryhB mutant. Our 
results explain the previously observed inability of fur mutants to grow on 
succinate. RyhB requires the RNA-binding protein, Hfq, for activity. Sequences 
within RyhB are complementary to regions within each of the target genes, 
suggesting that RyhB acts as an antisense RNA. In sdhCDAB, the complementary 
region is at the end of the first gene of the sdhCDAB operon; full-length 
sdhCDAB message disappears and a truncated message, equivalent in size to the 
region upstream of the complementarity, is detected when RyhB is expressed. RyhB 
provides a mechanism for the cell to down-regulate iron-storage proteins and 
nonessential iron-containing proteins when iron is limiting, thus modulating 
intracellular iron usage to supplement mechanisms for iron uptake directly 
regulated by Fur.

Transcriptional regulation of the aconitase genes (acnA and acnB) of Escherichia 
coli.

Biology and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 
2TN, UK.

Escherichia coli contains two differentially regulated aconitase genes, acnA and 
acnB. Two acnA promoters transcribing from start points located 407 bp (P1acnA) 
and 50 bp (P2acnA) upstream of the acnA coding region, and one acnB promoter 
(PacnB) with a start point 95 bp upstream of the acnB coding region, were 
identified by primer extension analysis. A 2.8 kb acnA monocistronic transcript 
was detected by Northern blot hybridization, but only in redox-stressed 
(methyl-viologen-treated) cultures, and a 2.5 kb acnB monocistronic transcript 
was detected in exponential- but not stationary-phase cultures. These findings 
are consistent with previous observations that acnA is specifically subject to 
SoxRS-mediated activation, whereas acnB encodes the major aconitase that is 
synthesized earlier in the growth cycle than AcnA. Further studies with acn-lacZ 
gene fusions and a wider range of transcription regulators indicated that acnA 
expression is initiated by sigma 38 from P1acnA, and from P2acnA it is activated 
directly or indirectly by CRP, FruR, Fur and SoxRS, and repressed by ArcA and 
FNR. In contrast, acnB expression is activated by CRP and repressed by ArcA, 
FruR and Fis from PacnB. Comparable studies with fum-lacZ fusions indicated that 
transcription of fumC, but not of fumA or fumB, is initiated by RNA polymerase 
containing sigma 38. It is concluded that AcnB is the major citric acid cycle 
enzyme, whereas AcnA is an aerobic stationary-phase enzyme that is specifically 
induced by iron and redox-stress.

Two genetically-distinct and differentially-regulated aconitases (AcnA and AcnB) 
in Escherichia coli.

Gruer MJ(1), Guest JR.

Author information:
(1)Krebs Institute for Biomolecular Research, Department of Molecular Biology 
and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield, UK.

An acnA mutant of Escherichia coli was constructed by replacing the chromosomal 
acnA gene by an internally deleted derivative containing a kanR cassette. 
Southern and Western blotting confirmed that the acnA gene had been replaced by 
the disrupted gene and that the aconitase A protein was no longer expressed. 
However, the mutant failed to exhibit the anticipated glutamate auxotrophy and 
it retained a residual aconitase activity. This activity was due to an analogous 
unstable enzyme(s) designated aconitase B. Studies on the regulation of 
aconitase A synthesis using an acnA-lacZ translational fusion showed that the 
acnA gene resembles other citric acid cycle genes in being subject to 
CRP-mediated catabolite repression and ArcA-mediated anaerobic repression. In 
addition to being activated by the SoxRS oxidative stress regulatory system, the 
acnA gene appeared to be activated by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur). It was 
concluded that the acnA gene belongs to at least four global regulatory 
networks, crp, arcA, fur and soxRS. In contrast, the aconitase B activity 
decreased after exposure to oxidative stress and was less affected by 
anaerobiosis. Comparable studies with the fumarase genes (fumA, B and C) 
indicated that fumA (encoding the unstable aerobic iron-sulphur-containing 
fumarase) is activated by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) and fumC (encoding 
the stable fumarase) is activated by the SoxRS oxidative stress regulatory 
system.

Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression and 
physiology in bacteria. RyhB is an iron-responsive sRNA well characterized in 
Escherichia coli and conserved in other Enterobacteriaceae. In this study, we 
identified and characterized two RyhB homologs (named RyhB-1 and RyhB-2) in the 
fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri. We found that, as in other Enterobacteriaceae, 
both RyhB-1 and RyhB-2 are induced under iron starvation, repressed by the Fur 
regulator, and depend on Hfq for stability. Despite these similarities in 
expression, the mutant strains of Y. ruckeri lacking RyhB-1 (ΔryhB-1) or RyhB-2 
(ΔryhB-2) exhibited differential phenotypes. In comparison with the wild type, 
the ΔryhB-1 strain showed a hypermotile phenotype, reduced biofilm formation, 
increased replication rate, faster growth, and increased ATP levels in bacterial 
cultures. By contrast, in salmon cell cultures, the ΔryhB-1 strain exhibited an 
increased survival. On the other hand, the ΔryhB-2 strain was non-motile and 
showed augmented biofilm formation as compared to the wild type. The expression 
of a subset of RyhB conserved targets, selected from different bacterial 
species, was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in wild type, ΔryhB-1, ΔryhB-2, and 
ΔryhB-1 ΔryhB-2 strains cultured in iron-depleted media. RyhB-1 negatively 
affected the expression of most analyzed genes (sodB, acnA, sdhC, bfr, fliF, 
among others), whose functions are related to metabolism and motility, involving 
iron-containing proteins. Among the genes analyzed, only sdhC and bfr appeared 
as targets for RyhB-2. Taken together, these results indicate that Y. ruckeri 
RyhB homologs participate in the modulation of the bacterial physiology with 
non-redundant roles.

BACKGROUND: Serratia plymuthica WS3236 was selected for whole genome sequencing 
based on preliminary genetic and chemical screening indicating the presence of 
multiple natural product pathways. This led to the identification of a putative 
sodorifen biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). The natural product sodorifen is a 
volatile organic compound (VOC) with an unusual polymethylated hydrocarbon 
bicyclic structure (C16H26) produced by selected strains of S. plymuthica. The 
BGC encoding sodorifen consists of four genes, two of which (sodA, sodB) are 
homologs of genes encoding enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway and are thought 
to enhance the amounts of available farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), the precursor 
of sodorifen. Proceeding from FPP, only two enzymes are necessary to produce 
sodorifen: an S-adenosyl methionine dependent methyltransferase (SodC) with 
additional cyclisation activity and a terpene-cyclase (SodD). Previous analysis 
of S. plymuthica found sodorifen production titers are generally low and vary 
significantly among different producer strains. This precludes studies on the 
still elusive biological function of this structurally and biosynthetically 
fascinating bacterial terpene.
RESULTS: Sequencing and mining of the S. plymuthica WS3236 genome revealed the 
presence of 38 BGCs according to antiSMASH analysis, including a putative 
sodorifen BGC. Further genome mining for sodorifen and sodorifen-like BGCs 
throughout bacteria was performed using SodC and SodD as queries and identified 
a total of 28 sod-like gene clusters. Using direct pathway cloning (DiPaC) we 
intercepted the 4.6 kb candidate sodorifen BGC from S. plymuthica WS3236 
(sodA-D) and transformed it into Escherichia coli BL21. Heterologous expression 
under the control of the tetracycline inducible PtetO promoter firmly linked 
this BGC to sodorifen production. By utilizing this newly established expression 
system, we increased the production yields by approximately 26-fold when 
compared to the native producer. In addition, sodorifen was easily isolated in 
high purity by simple head-space sampling.
CONCLUSIONS: Genome mining of all available genomes within the NCBI and JGI IMG 
databases led to the identification of a wealth of sod-like pathways which may 
be responsible for producing a range of structurally unknown sodorifen analogs. 
Introduction of the S. plymuthica WS3236 sodorifen BGC into the fast-growing 
heterologous expression host E. coli with a very low VOC background led to a 
significant increase in both sodorifen product yield and purity compared to the 
native producer. By providing a reliable, high-level production system, this 
study sets the stage for future investigations of the biological role and 
function of sodorifen and for functionally unlocking the bioinformatically 
identified putative sod-like pathways.

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) renders bacteria highly resistant to oxidative 
stress, but its mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we report that 
3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) is the major source of endogenous 
H2S in Escherichia coli Cellular resistance to H2O2 strongly depends on the 
activity of mstA, a gene that encodes 3MST. Deletion of the ferric uptake 
regulator (Fur) renders ∆mstA cells hypersensitive to H2O2 Conversely, induction 
of chromosomal mstA from a strong pLtetO-1 promoter (P tet -mstA) renders ∆fur 
cells fully resistant to H2O2 Furthermore, the endogenous level of H2S is 
reduced in ∆fur or ∆sodA ∆sodB cells but restored after the addition of an iron 
chelator dipyridyl. Using a highly sensitive reporter of the global response to 
DNA damage (SOS) and the TUNEL assay, we show that 3MST-derived H2S protects 
chromosomal DNA from oxidative damage. We also show that the induction of the 
CysB regulon in response to oxidative stress depends on 3MST, whereas the 
CysB-regulated l-cystine transporter, TcyP, plays the principle role in the 
3MST-mediated generation of H2S. These findings led us to propose a model to 
explain the interplay between l-cysteine metabolism, H2S production, and 
oxidative stress, in which 3MST protects E. coli against oxidative stress via 
l-cysteine utilization and H2S-mediated sequestration of free iron necessary for 
the genotoxic Fenton reaction.

Post-transcriptional regulatory processes may change transcript levels and 
affect cell-to-cell variability or noise. We study small-RNA downregulation to 
elucidate its effects on noise in the iron homeostasis network of Escherichia 
coli In this network, the small-RNA RyhB undergoes stoichiometric degradation 
with the transcripts of target genes in response to iron stress. Using 
single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, we measured transcript 
numbers of the RyhB-regulated genes sodB and fumA in individual cells as a 
function of iron deprivation. We observed a monotonic increase of noise with 
iron stress but no evidence of theoretically predicted, enhanced stoichiometric 
fluctuations in transcript numbers, nor of bistable behavior in transcript 
distributions. Direct detection of RyhB in individual cells shows that its noise 
is much smaller than that of these two targets, when RyhB production is 
significant. A generalized two-state model of bursty transcription that neglects 
RyhB fluctuations describes quantitatively the dependence of noise and 
transcript distributions on iron deprivation, enabling extraction of in vivo 
RyhB-mediated transcript degradation rates. The transcripts' threshold-linear 
behavior indicates that the effective in vivo interaction strength between RyhB 
and its two target transcripts is comparable. Strikingly, the bacterial cell 
response exhibits Fur-dependent, switch-like activation instead of a graded 
response to iron deprivation.

A mixed incoherent feed-forward loop allows conditional regulation of response 
dynamics.

Expression of the SodA superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in Escherichia coli is 
regulated by superoxide concentration through the SoxRS system and also by Fur 
(Ferric uptake regulator) through a mixed incoherent feed forward loop (FFL) 
containing the RyhB small regulatory RNA. In this work I theoretically analyze 
the function of this feed forward loop as part of the network controlling 
expression of the two cytoplasmic superoxide dismutases, SodA and SodB. I find 
that feed forward regulation allows faster response to superoxide stress at low 
intracellular iron levels compared to iron rich conditions. That is, it can 
conditionally modulate the response time of a superimposed transcriptional 
control mechanism.

BACKGROUND: The Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a transcriptional regulator 
that controls iron homeostasis in bacteria. Although the regulatory role of Fur 
in Escherichia coli is well characterized, most of the studies were conducted 
under routine culture conditions, i.e., in ambient oxygen concentration. To 
reveal potentially novel aspects of the Fur regulon in Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium under oxygen conditions similar to that encountered in the 
host, we compared the transcriptional profiles of the virulent wild-type strain 
(ATCC 14028s) and its isogenic Δfur strain under anaerobic conditions.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis of anaerobically grown Δfur S. Typhimurium 
identified 298 differentially expressed genes. Expression of several genes 
controlled by Fnr and NsrR appeared to be also dependent on Fur. Furthermore, 
Fur was required for the activity of the cytoplasmic superoxide disumutases 
(MnSOD and FeSOD). The regulation of FeSOD gene, sodB, occurred via small RNAs 
(i.e., the ryhB homologs, rfrA and rfrB) with the aid of the RNA chaperone Hfq. 
The transcription of sodA was increased in Δfur; however, the enzyme was 
inactive due to the incorporation of iron instead of manganese in SodA. 
Additionally, in Δfur, the expression of the gene coding for the ferritin-like 
protein (ftnB) was down-regulated, while the transcription of the gene coding 
for the nitric oxide (NO·) detoxifying flavohemoglobin (hmpA) was up-regulated. 
The promoters of ftnB and hmpA do not contain recognized Fur binding motifs, 
which indicated their probable indirect regulation by Fur. However, Fur 
activation of ftnB was independent of Fnr. In addition, the expression of the 
gene coding for the histone-like protein, H-NS (hns) was increased in Δfur. This 
may explain the observed down-regulation of the tdc operon, responsible for the 
anaerobic degradation of threonine, and ftnB in Δfur.
CONCLUSIONS: This study determined that Fur is a positive factor in ftnB 
regulation, while serving to repress the expression of hmpA. Furthermore, Fur is 
required for the proper expression and activation of the antioxidant enzymes, 
FeSOD and MnSOD. Finally, this work identified twenty-six new targets of Fur 
regulation, and demonstrates that H-NS repressed genes are down-regulated in 
Δfur.

Previous microarray studies have suggested that an indirect mechanism of Fur 
regulation may be present in meningococcus at the posttranscriptional level 
through a small regulatory RNA (sRNA) system analogous to that of Escherichia 
coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recently, a Fur-regulated sRNA, NrrF, was 
identified that is involved in the iron regulation of the sdhA and sdhC 
succinate dehydrogenase genes. Here we report a detailed transcriptional 
analysis of the nrrF gene and show that NrrF is a Hfq-dependent sRNA. The Hfq 
protein mediates nrrF downregulation and Fur-dependent upregulation of the 
sdhCDAB operon, the major in vivo NrrF-regulated operon. NrrF forms a duplex in 
vitro with a region of complementarity overlapping the sdhDA mRNA junction. 
Furthermore, Hfq binds to NrrF in vitro and considerably enhances the efficiency 
of the interaction of the sRNA with the identified target. Our data suggest that 
Hfq-meditated binding of NrrF to the in vivo target in the sdhCDAB mRNA may 
cause the rapid degradation of the transcript, resulting in Fur-dependent 
positive regulation of succinate dehydrogenase. In addition, while the 
upregulation of sodB and fumB by Fur is dependent on the Hfq protein, it is 
unaffected in the nrrF knockout, which suggests that there is more than one sRNA 
regulator involved in iron homeostasis in meningococcus.

Gordonia westfalica Kb1 and Gordonia polyisoprenivorans VH2 induce the formation 
of an extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) during poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) 
degradation. To investigate the function of this enzyme in G. polyisoprenivorans 
VH2, the sodA gene was disrupted. The mutants exhibited reduced growth in liquid 
mineral salt media containing poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) as the sole carbon and 
energy source, and no SOD activity was detectable in the supernatants of the 
cultures. Growth experiments revealed that SodA activity is required for optimal 
growth on poly(cis-1,4-isoprene), whereas this enzyme has no effect on aerobic 
growth in the presence of water-soluble substrates like succinate, acetate, and 
propionate. This was detected by activity staining, and proof of expression was 
by antibody detection of SOD. When SodA from G. westfalica Kb1 was 
heterologously expressed in the sodA sodB double mutant Escherichia coli QC779, 
the recombinant mutant exhibited increased resistance to paraquat, thereby 
indicating the functionality of the G. westfalica Kb1 SodA and indirectly 
protection of G. westfalica cells by SodA from oxidative damage. Both sodA from 
G. polyisoprenivorans VH2 and sodA from G. westfalica Kb1 coded for polypeptides 
comprising 209 amino acids and having approximately 90% and 70% identical amino 
acids, respectively, to the SodA from Mycobacterium smegmatis strain MC(2) 155 
and Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665. As revealed by activity staining experiments 
with the wild type and the disruption mutant of G. polyisoprenivorans, this 
bacterium harbors only one active SOD belonging to the manganese family. The 
N-terminal sequences of the extracellular SodA proteins of both Gordonia species 
showed no evidence of leader peptides for the mature proteins, like the 
intracellular SodA protein of G. polyisoprenivorans VH2, which was purified 
under native conditions from the cells. In G. westfalica Kb1 and G. 
polyisoprenivorans VH2, SodA probably provides protection against reactive 
oxygen intermediates which occur during degradation of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene).

Up-expression of NapA and other oxidative stress proteins is a compensatory 
response to loss of major Helicobacter pylori stress resistance factors.

Twenty-six Helicobacter pylori targeted mutant strains with deficiencies in 
oxidative stress combating proteins, including 12 double mutant strains were 
analyzed via physiological and proteomic approaches to distinguish the major 
expression changes caused by the mutations. Mutations were introduced into both 
a Mtz(S) and a Mtz(R) strain background. Most of the mutations caused increased 
growth sensitivity of the strains to oxygen, and they all exhibited clear 
compensatory up-expression of oxidative stress resistance proteins enabling 
survival of the bacterium. The most frequent up-expressed oxidative stress 
resistance factor (observed in 16 of the mutants) was the iron-sequestering 
protein NapA, linking iron sequestration with oxidative stress resistance. The 
up-expression of individual proteins in mutants ranged from 2 to 10 fold that of 
the wild type strain, even when incubated in a low O(2) environment. For 
example, a considerably higher level of catalase expression (4 fold of that in 
the wild-type strain) was observed in ahpC napA and ahpC sodB double mutants. A 
Fur mutant up-expressed ferritin (Pfr) protein 20-fold. In some mutant strains 
the bacterial DNA is protected from oxidative stress damage apparently via 
overexpression of oxidative stress-combating proteins such as NapA, catalase or 
MdaB (an NADPH quinone reductase). Our results show that H. pylori has a variety 
of ways to compensate for loss of major oxidative stress combating factors.

RyhB is a noncoding RNA regulated by the Fur repressor. It has previously been 
shown to cause the rapid degradation of a number of mRNAs that encode proteins 
that utilize iron. Here we examine the effect of ectopic RyhB production on 
global gene expression by microarray analysis. Many of the previously identified 
targets were found, as well as other mRNAs encoding iron-binding proteins, 
bringing the total number of regulated operons to at least 18, encoding 56 
genes. The two major operons involved in Fe-S cluster assembly showed different 
behavior; the isc operon appears to be a direct target of RyhB action, while the 
suf operon does not. This is consistent with previous findings suggesting that 
the suf genes but not the isc genes are important for Fe-S cluster synthesis 
under iron-limiting conditions, presumably for essential iron-binding proteins. 
In addition, we observed repression of Fur-regulated genes upon RyhB expression, 
interpreted as due to intracellular iron sparing resulting from reduced 
synthesis of iron-binding proteins. Our results demonstrate the broad effects of 
a single noncoding RNA on iron homeostasis.

The RcsAB box. Characterization of a new operator essential for the regulation

The interaction of the two transcriptional regulators RcsA and RcsB with a 
specific operator is a common mechanism in the activation of capsule 
biosynthesis in enteric bacteria. We describe RcsAB binding sites in the wza 
promoter of the operon for colanic acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli K-12, 
in the galF promoter of the operon for K2 antigen biosynthesis in Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, and in the tviA (vipR) promoter of the operon for Vi antigen 
biosynthesis in Salmonella typhi. We further show the interaction of RcsAB with 
the rcsA promoters of various species, indicating that rcsA autoregulation also 
depends on the presence of both proteins. The compilation of all identified 
RcsAB binding sites revealed the conserved core sequence TaAGaatatTCctA, which 
we propose to be termed RcsAB box. The RcsAB box is also part of Bordetella 
pertussis BvgA binding sites and may represent a more distributed recognition 
motif within the LuxR superfamily of transcriptional regulators. The RcsAB box 
is essential for the induction of Rcs-regulated promoters. Site-specific 
mutations of conserved nucleotides in the RcsAB boxes of the E. coli wza and 
rcsA promoters resulted in an exopolysaccharide-negative phenotype and in the 
reduction of reporter gene expression.

The Sinorhizobium meliloti nlpD gene consists of 1,539 nucleotides and codes for 
512 amino acids. Expression of the nlpD gene as a histidine-tagged protein in 
Escherichia coli resulted in the production of a 57-kDa protein. The deduced 
polypeptide sequence of NlpD contains one unusual hexamer repeat (KVQRGQ), one 
tetramer (TVTV) and two direct and inverted trimer repeats (KAA, AAK). The 
N-terminal amino acid residues displayed similarity with signal peptides of 
secreted bacterial lipoproteins. Mutations of the S. meliloti nlpD gene caused 
decreased survival of cells in the stationary phase.

The nucleotide second messenger c-di-GMP nearly ubiquitously promotes bacterial 
biofilm formation, with enzymes that synthesize and degrade c-di-GMP being 
controlled by diverse N-terminal sensor domains. Here, we describe a novel class 
of widely occurring c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases (PDE) that feature a periplasmic 
"CSS domain" with two highly conserved cysteines that is flanked by two 
transmembrane regions (TM1 and TM2) and followed by a cytoplasmic EAL domain 
with PDE activity. Using PdeC, one of the five CSS domain PDEs of Escherichia 
coli K-12, we show that DsbA/DsbB-promoted disulfide bond formation in the CSS 
domain reduces PDE activity. By contrast, the free thiol form is enzymatically 
highly active, with the TM2 region promoting dimerization. Moreover, this form 
is processed by periplasmic proteases DegP and DegQ, yielding a highly active 
TM2 + EAL fragment that is slowly removed by further proteolysis. Similar redox 
control and proteolysis was also observed for a second CSS domain PDE, PdeB. At 
the physiological level, CSS domain PDEs modulate production and supracellular 
architecture of extracellular matrix polymers in the deeper layers of mature 
E. coli biofilms.

Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a global transcription regulator that is 
ubiquitous to Gram-negative bacteria and regulates diverse biological processes, 
including iron uptake, cellular metabolism, stress response, and production of 
virulence determinants. As a result, for many pathogenic bacteria, Fur plays a 
crucial role in the course of infection and disease development. In this study, 
the fur gene was cloned from a pathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens strain, TSS, 
isolated from diseased Japanese flounder cultured in a local farm. TSS Fur can 
partially complement the defective phenotype of an Escherichia coli fur mutant. 
A TSS fur null mutant, TFM, was constructed. Compared to TSS, TFM exhibits 
reduced growth ability, aberrant production of outer membrane proteins, 
decreased resistance against host serum bactericidal activity, impaired ability 
to disseminate in host blood and tissues, and drastic attenuation in overall 
bacterial virulence in a Japanese flounder infection model. When used as a live 
vaccine administered via the injection, immersion, and oral routes, TFM affords 
high levels of protection upon Japanese flounder against not only P. fluorescens 
infection but also Aeromonas hydrophila infection. Furthermore, a plasmid, pJAQ, 
was constructed, which expresses the coding element of the Vibrio harveyi 
antigen AgaV-DegQ. TFM harboring pJAQ can secret AgaV-DegQ into the 
extracellular milieu. Vaccination of Japanese flounder with live TFM/pJAQ 
elicited strong immunoprotection against both V. harveyi and A. hydrophila 
infections.

In the framework of the international project aimed at the sequencing of the 
Bacillus subtilis genome, five DNA fragments in the region between rrnB (275 
degrees) and pai (284 degrees) were cloned by inverse and combinatorial 
long-range PCR and their nucleotide sequences were determined and analysed. 
Together these sequences constituted a contig of 62229 bp. On the basis of the 
position of Not1 and Stil restriction sites, the orientation and order of known 
genetic markers was determined to be pai (284 degrees)-degQ comQ comP comAA 
comAB-pbpD-kapB kinB patB-mcpB tipA mcpA tipB-rrnB (275 degrees). Fifty-four 
ORFs were detected. Thirteen of these coincided with known B. subtilis genes, 
and 41 new ORFs were found. Of the predicted new gene products, 12 showed no 
significant similarity to other known proteins, whereas ten showed strong 
similarity to proteins of other organisms with unknown function. Nineteen 
predicted proteins showed strong similarity to known proteins of other 
organisms, for instance a Na+/H+ antiporter system of Bacillus alcalophilus, a 
sugar transport system found in Mycoplasma genitalium, NADH-dependent butanol 
dehydrogenase of Clostridium acetobutylicum, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase A of 
B, subtilis, exo-1,4-alpha-glucosidase activity of Bacillus stearothermophilus

The heterotrimeric SecYEG complex cooperates with YidC to facilitate membrane 
protein insertion by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that YidC contacts the 
interior of the SecY channel resulting in a ligand-activated and 
voltage-dependent complex with distinct ion channel characteristics. The SecYEG 
pore diameter decreases from 8 Å to only 5 Å for the YidC-SecYEG pore, 
indicating a reduction in channel cross-section by YidC intercalation. In the 
presence of a substrate, YidC relocates to the rim of the pore as indicated by 
increased pore diameter and loss of YidC crosslinks to the channel interior. 
Changing the surface charge of the pore by incorporating YidC into the channel 
wall increases the anion selectivity, and the accompanying change in wall 
hydrophobicity is liable to alter the partition of helices from the pore into 
the membrane. This could explain how the exit of transmembrane domains from the 
SecY channel is facilitated by YidC.

The Sec translocon constitutes a ubiquitous protein transport channel that 
consists in bacteria of the three core components: SecY, SecE, and SecG. 
Additional proteins interact with SecYEG during different stages of protein 
transport. During targeting, SecYEG interacts with SecA, the SRP receptor, or 
the ribosome. Protein transport into or across the membrane is then facilitated 
by the interaction of SecYEG with YidC and the SecDFYajC complex. During protein 
transport, SecYEG is likely to interact also with the protein quality control 
machinery, but details about this interaction are missing. By in vivo and in 
vitro site-directed cross-linking, we show here that the periplasmic chaperone 
PpiD is located in front of the lateral gate of SecY, through which 
transmembrane domains exit the SecY channel. The strongest contacts were found 
to helix 2b of SecY. Blue native PAGE analyses verify the presence of a 
SecYEG-PpiD complex in native Escherichia coli membranes. The PpiD-SecY 
interaction was not influenced by the addition of SecA and only weakly 
influenced by binding of nontranslating ribosomes to SecYEG. In contrast, PpiD 
lost contact to the lateral gate of SecY during membrane protein insertion. 
These data identify PpiD as an additional and transient subunit of the bacterial 
SecYEG translocon. The data furthermore demonstrate the highly modular and 
versatile composition of the Sec translocon, which is probably essential for its 
ability to transport a wide range of substrates across membranes in bacteria and 
eukaryotes.

Most membrane proteins are co-translationally inserted into the lipid bilayer 
via the universally conserved SecY complex and they access the lipid phase 
presumably via a lateral gate in SecY. In bacteria, the lipid transfer of 
membrane proteins from the SecY channel is assisted by the SecY-associated 
protein YidC, but details on the SecY-YidC interaction are unknown. By employing 
an in vivo and in vitro site-directed cross-linking approach, we have mapped the 
SecY-YidC interface and found YidC in contact with all four transmembrane 
domains of the lateral gate. This interaction did not require the SecDFYajC 
complex and was not influenced by SecA binding to SecY. In contrast, ribosomes 
dissociated the YidC contacts to lateral gate helices 2b and 8. The major 
contact between YidC and the lateral gate was lost in the presence of ribosome 
nascent chains and new SecY-YidC contacts appeared. These data demonstrate that 
the SecY-YidC interaction is influenced by nascent-membrane-induced lateral gate 
movements.

Signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent protein targeting is a universally 
conserved process that delivers proteins to the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane 
or to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes. Crucial during targeting 
is the transfer of the ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) from SRP to the Sec 
translocon. In eukaryotes, this step is co-ordinated by the SRβ subunit of the 
SRP receptor (SR), which probably senses a vacant translocon by direct 
interaction with the translocon. Bacteria lack the SRβ subunit and how they 
co-ordinate RNC transfer is unknown. By site-directed cross-linking and 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses, we show that FtsY, the 
bacterial SRα homologue, binds to the exposed C4/C5 loops of SecY, the central 
component of the bacterial Sec translocon. The same loops serve also as binding 
sites for SecA and the ribosome. The FtsY-SecY interaction involves at least the 
A domain of FtsY, which attributes an important function to this so far 
ill-defined domain. Binding of FtsY to SecY residues, which are also used by 
SecA and the ribosome, probably allows FtsY to sense an available translocon and 
to align the incoming SRP-RNC with the protein conducting channel. Thus, the 
Escherichia coli FtsY encompasses the functions of both the eukaryotic SRα and 
SRβ subunits in one single protein.

BACKGROUND: The signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor plays a vital role in 
co-translational protein targeting, because it connects the soluble 
SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complex (SRP-RNCs) to the membrane bound Sec 
translocon. The eukaryotic SRP receptor (SR) is a heterodimeric protein complex, 
consisting of two unrelated GTPases. The SRbeta subunit is an integral membrane 
protein, which tethers the SRP-interacting SRalpha subunit permanently to the 
endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The prokaryotic SR lacks the SRbeta subunit and 
consists of only the SRalpha homologue FtsY. Strikingly, although FtsY requires 
membrane contact for functionality, cell fractionation studies have localized 
FtsY predominantly to the cytosolic fraction of Escherichia coli. So far, the 
exact function of the soluble SR in E. coli is unknown, but it has been 
suggested that, in contrast to eukaryotes, the prokaryotic SR might bind 
SRP-RNCs already in the cytosol and only then initiates membrane targeting.
RESULTS: In the current study we have determined the contribution of soluble 
FtsY to co-translational targeting in vitro and have re-analysed the 
localization of FtsY in vivo by fluorescence microscopy. Our data show that FtsY 
can bind to SRP-ribosome nascent chains (RNCs) in the absence of membranes. 
However, these soluble FtsY-SRP-RNC complexes are not efficiently targeted to 
the membrane. In contrast, we observed effective targeting of SRP-RNCs to 
membrane-bond FtsY. These data show that soluble FtsY does not contribute 
significantly to cotranslational targeting in E. coli. In agreement with this 
observation, our in vivo analyses of FtsY localization in bacterial cells by 
fluorescence microscopy revealed that the vast majority of FtsY was localized to 
the inner membrane and that soluble FtsY constituted only a negligible species 
in vivo.
CONCLUSION: The exact function of the SRP receptor (SR) in bacteria has so far 
been enigmatic. Our data show that the bacterial SR is almost exclusively 
membrane-bound in vivo, indicating that the presence of a soluble SR is probably 
an artefact of cell fractionation. Thus, co-translational targeting in bacteria 
does not involve the formation of a soluble SR-signal recognition particle 
(SRP)-ribosome nascent chain (RNC) intermediate but requires membrane contact of 
FtsY for efficient SRP-RNC recruitment.

The universally conserved SecYEG/Sec61 translocon constitutes the major 
protein-conducting channel in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and the 
endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotes. It is engaged in both 
translocating secretory proteins across the membrane as well as in integrating 
membrane proteins into the lipid phase of the membrane. In the current study we 
have detected distinct SecYEG translocon complexes in native Escherichia coli 
membranes. Blue-Native-PAGE revealed the presence of a 200-kDa SecYEG complex in 
resting membranes. When the SecA-dependent secretory protein pOmpA was trapped 
inside the SecYEG channel, a smaller SecY-containing complex of approximately 
140-kDa was observed, which probably corresponds to a monomeric SecYEG-substrate 
complex. Trapping the SRP-dependent polytopic membrane protein mannitol permease 
in the SecYEG translocon, resulted in two complexes of 250 and 600 kDa, each 
containing both SecY and the translocon-associated membrane protein YidC. The 
appearance of both complexes was correlated with the number of transmembrane 
domains that were exposed during targeting of mannitol permease to the membrane. 
These results suggest that the assembly or the stability of the bacterial SecYEG 
translocon is influenced by the substrate that needs to be transported.

Transport and membrane integration of polypeptides is carried out by specific 
protein complexes in the membranes of all living cells. The Sec transport path 
provides an essential and ubiquitous route for protein translocation. In the 
bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, the channel is formed by oligomers of a 
heterotrimeric membrane protein complex consisting of subunits SecY, SecE and 
SecG. In the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the channel is formed from the 
related Sec61 complex. Here we report the structure of the Escherichia coli 
SecYEG assembly at an in-plane resolution of 8 A. The three-dimensional map, 
calculated from two-dimensional SecYEG crystals, reveals a sandwich of two 
membranes interacting through the extensive cytoplasmic domains. Each membrane 
is composed of dimers of SecYEG. The monomeric complex contains 15 transmembrane 
helices. In the centre of the dimer we observe a 16 x 25 A cavity closed on the 
periplasmic side by two highly tilted transmembrane helices. This may represent 
the closed state of the protein-conducting channel.

In this study, we have characterized the in vitro binding of Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae Fur to several well-defined iron transport genes, as well as to 
additional genes involved in major catabolic, secretory, and recombination 
pathways of gonococci. The gonococcal Fur protein was recombinantly expressed in 
Escherichia coli HBMV119. Fur was isolated from inclusion bodies and partially 
purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Gonococcal Fur was found to bind to the 
promoter/operator region of a gene encoding the previously identified 
Fur-regulated periplasmic binding protein (FbpA) in a metal ion-dependent 
fashion, demonstrating that purified Fur is functional. In silico analysis of 
the partially completed gonococcal genome (FA1090) identified Fur boxes in the 
promoters of several genes, including tonB, fur, recN, secY, sodB, hemO, hmbR, 
fumC, a hypothetical gene (Fe-S homolog), and the opa family of genes. By using 
purified gonococcal Fur, we demonstrate binding to the operator regions of tonB, 
fur, recN, secY, sodB, hemO, hmbR, fumC, the Fe-S homolog gene, and the opa gene 
family as determined by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. While 
gonococcal Fur was demonstrated to bind to the promoter regions of all 11 opa 
genes (opaA through -K), we did not detect binding of purified E. coli Fur with 
8 of the 11 opa members, indicating that target DNA sequence specificities 
between these two closely related proteins exist. Furthermore, we observed 
differences in the relative strengths of binding of gonococcal Fur for these 
different genes, which most likely reflect a difference in affinity between 
gonococcal Fur and its DNA targets. This is the first report that definitively 
demonstrates the binding of gonococcal Fur to its own promoter/operator region, 
as well as to the opa family of genes that encode surface proteins. Our results 
demonstrate that the gonococcal Fur protein binds to the regulatory regions of a 
broad array of genes and indicates that the gonococcal Fur regulon is larger 
than originally proposed.

SRP-dependent co-translational targeting and SecA-dependent translocation 
analyzed as individual steps in the export of a bacterial protein.

Recently it has been recognized that the signal recognition particle (SRP) of 
Escherichia coli represents a specific targeting device for hydrophobic inner 
membrane proteins. It has remained unclear, however, whether the bacterial SRP 
functions in concert with SecA, which is required for the translocation of 
secretory proteins across the inner membrane. Here, we have analyzed a hybrid 
protein constructed by fusing the signal anchor sequence of an SRP-dependent 
inner membrane protein (MtlA) to the mature part of an exclusively 
SecA-requiring secretory protein (OmpA). We show that the signal anchor sequence 
of MtlA confers the novel properties onto nascent chains of OmpA of being 
co-translationally recognized and targeted to SecY by SRP. Once targeted to 
SecY, ribosome-associated nascent chains of the hybrid protein, however, remain 
untranslocated unless SecA is present. These results indicate that SRP and SecA 
cooperate in a sequential, non-overlapping manner in the topogenesis of those 
membrane proteins which, in addition to a signal anchor sequence, harbor a 
substantial hydrophilic domain to be translocated into the periplasm.

Dissecting the translocase and integrase functions of the Escherichia coli

Recent evidence suggests that in Escherichia coli, SecA/SecB and signal 
recognition particle (SRP) are constituents of two different pathways targeting 
secretory and inner membrane proteins to the SecYEG translocon of the plasma 
membrane. We now show that a secY mutation, which compromises a functional 
SecY-SecA interaction, does not impair the SRP-mediated integration of polytopic 
inner membrane proteins. Furthermore, under conditions in which the 
translocation of secretory proteins is strictly dependent on SecG for assisting 
SecA, the absence of SecG still allows polytopic membrane proteins to integrate 
at the wild-type level. These results indicate that SRP-dependent integration 
and SecA/SecB-mediated translocation do not only represent two independent 
protein delivery systems, but also remain mechanistically distinct processes 
even at the level of the membrane where they engage different domains of SecY 
and different components of the translocon. In addition, the experimental setup 
used here enabled us to demonstrate that SRP-dependent integration of a 
multispanning protein into membrane vesicles leads to a biologically active 
enzyme.

L24 by mutations affecting the lon gene product for protease LA in Escherichia 
coli K12.

A suppressor mutation of a temperature-sensitive mutant of ribosomal protein L24 
(rplX19) was mapped close to the lon gene by genetic analysis and was shown to 
affect protease LA. The degradation and the synthesis rates of individual 
ribosomal proteins were determined. Proteins L24, L14, L15 and L27 were found to 
be degraded faster in the original rplX19 mutant than in the rplX19 mutant 
containing the suppressor mutation. Other ribosomal proteins were either weakly 
or not at all degraded in both mutants. Temperature-sensitive growth was also 
suppressed by the overproduction of mutant protein L24 from a plasmid. Our 
results suggest that (1) either free ribosomal proteins or proteins bound to 
abortive assembly precursors are highly susceptible to the lon gene product and 
(2) the mutationally altered protein L24 can still function at the nonpermissive 
growth temperature of the mutant, if it is present in sufficient amounts.

Temperature-resistant pseudorevertants of the temperature-sensitive Escherichia 
coli mutant KNS19, harboring a mutation in rplX, the gene for ribosomal protein 
L24, were isolated, cloned, and sequenced. The codon GAC for the amino acid Asp 
in the temperature-sensitive mutant corresponding to position 84 in the protein 
chain mutated either back to the wild type (Gly) or to codons for the amino 
acids Tyr and Glu. Furthermore, rplX genes from two other mutants with an 
altered protein L24 were cloned and sequenced. The mutations were localized at 
position 56 (Gly to Asp) and at position 62 (Glu to Lys) in the rplX gene. The 
latter two mutants lacked a conditional lethal phenotype. The results suggest 
that the amino acid Gly at positions 56 and 84 in the protein might be involved 
in loop formations.

The Rhizobium leguminosarum FnrN protein is functionally similar to Escherichia 
coli Fnr and promotes heterologous oxygen-dependent activation of transcription.

An open reading frame from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae strain VF39, 
previously identified and found to be similar to Escherichia coli fnr and 
Rhizobium meliloti fixK (orf240, thereafter called fnrN), was further analysed. 
Analysis of the expression of an fnrN-lacZ transcriptional fusion revealed that 
fnrN is preferentially expressed under oxygen limitation. Using R. meliloti 
fixN-lacZ fusions it was shown that the fnrN gene product only mediates 
transcriptional activation under microaerobiosis, indicating that the FnrN 
protein responds, directly or indirectly, to oxygen. Plasmids which expressed 
fnrN under the control of an E. coli promoter were able to complement an E. coli 
fnr mutant with respect to anaerobic growth on nitrate but not fumarate, and to 
promote anaerobic but not aerobic activation of the Fnr-dependent E. coli genes 
narGHJI, nirB and fdnGHI coding for nitrate reductase, NADH-dependent nitrite 
reductase and formate dehydrogenase-N, respectively. Fumarate and DMSO reductase 
activities were not induced by FnrN. The E. coli fnr gene substituted for fnrN 
in oxygen-regulated transcription of nirB- and fixN-lacZ fusions in R. 
leguminosarum. The results indicate that Fnr and FnrN are functionally very 
similar and share a common mode of oxygen-dependent transcriptional activation. 
From hybridization studies, it appeared that fnrN-like genes are present in a 
number of different R. leguminosarum strains.

Role of the Tat ransport system in nitrous oxide reductase translocation and 
cytochrome cd1 biosynthesis in Pseudomonas stutzeri.

Heikkilä MP(1), Honisch U, Wunsch P, Zumft WG.

Author information:
(1)Lehrstuhl für Mikrobiologie, Universität Karlsruhe, D-76128 Karlsruhe, 
Germany.

By transforming N2O to N2, the multicopper enzyme nitrous oxide reductase 
provides a periplasmic electron sink for a respiratory chain that is part of 
denitrification. The signal sequence of the enzyme carries the heptameric 
twin-arginine consensus motif characteristic of the Tat pathway. We have 
identified tat genes of Pseudomonas stutzeri and functionally analyzed the 
unlinked tatC and tatE loci. A tatC mutant retained N2O reductase in the 
cytoplasm in the unprocessed form and lacking the metal cofactors. This is 
contrary to viewing the Tat system as specific only for fully assembled 
proteins. A C618V exchange in the electron transfer center CuA rendered the 
enzyme largely incompetent for transport. The location of the mutation in the 
C-terminal domain of N(2)O reductase implies that the Tat system acts on a 
completely synthesized protein and is sensitive to a late structural variation 
in folding. By generating a tatE mutant and a reductase-overproducing strain, we 
show a function for TatE in N2O reductase translocation. Further, we have found 
that the Tat and Sec pathways have to cooperate to produce a functional nitrite 
reductase system. The cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase was found in the 
periplasm of the tatC mutant, suggesting export by the Sec pathway; however, the 
enzyme lacked the heme D1 macrocycle. The NirD protein as part of a complex 
required for heme D1 synthesis or processing carries a putative Tat signal 
peptide. Since NO reduction was also inhibited in the tatC mutant, the Tat 
protein translocation system is necessary in multiple ways for establishing 
anaerobic nitrite denitrification.

The methylotrophic bacterium Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 has the potential to 
become a platform organism for methanol-driven biotechnology. Its 
ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (EMCP) is essential during growth on C1 compounds and 
harbors several CoA-activated dicarboxylic acids. Those acids could serve as 
precursor molecules for various polymers. In the past, two dicarboxylic acid 
products, namely mesaconic acid and 2-methylsuccinic acid, were successfully 
produced with heterologous thioesterase YciA from Escherichia coli, but the 
yield was reduced by product reuptake. In our study, we conducted extensive 
research on the uptake mechanism of those dicarboxylic acid products. By using 
2,2-difluorosuccinic acid as a selection agent, we isolated a dicarboxylic acid 
import mutant. Analysis of the genome of this strain revealed a deletion in gene 
dctA2, which probably encodes an acid transporter. By testing additional single, 
double, and triple deletions, we were able to rule out the involvement of the 
two other DctA transporter homologs and the ketoglutarate transporter KgtP. 
Uptake of 2-methylsuccinic acid was significantly reduced in dctA2 mutants, 
while the uptake of mesaconic acid was completely prevented. Moreover, we 
demonstrated M. extorquens-based synthesis of citramalic acid and a further 
1.4-fold increase in product yield using a transport-deficient strain. This work 
represents an important step towards the development of robust M. extorquens AM1 
production strains for dicarboxylic acids. KEY POINTS: • 2,2-Difluorosuccinic 
acid is used to select for dicarboxylic acid uptake mutations. • Deletion of 
dctA2 leads to reduction of dicarboxylic acid uptake. • Transporter-deficient 
strains show improved production of citramalic acid.

Regulation of aerobic and anaerobic D-malate metabolism of Escherichia coli by 
the LysR-type regulator DmlR (YeaT).

Escherichia coli K-12 is able to grow under aerobic conditions on D-malate using 
DctA for D-malate uptake and the D-malate dehydrogenase DmlA (formerly YeaU) for 
converting D-malate to pyruvate. Induction of dmlA encoding DmlA required an 
intact dmlR (formerly yeaT) gene, which encodes DmlR, a LysR-type 
transcriptional regulator. Induction of dmlA by DmlR required the presence of 
D-malate or L- or meso-tartrate, but only D-malate supported aerobic growth. The 
regulator of general C(4)-dicarboxylate metabolism (DcuS-DcuR two-component 
system) had some effect on dmlA expression. The anaerobic L-tartrate regulator 
TtdR or the oxygen sensors ArcB-ArcA and FNR did not have a major effect on dmlA 
expression. DmlR has a high level of sequence identity (49%) with TtdR, the L- 
and meso-tartrate-specific regulator of L-tartrate fermentation in E. coli. dmlA 
was also expressed at high levels under anaerobic conditions, and the bacteria 
had D-malate dehydrogenase activity. These bacteria, however, were not able to 
grow on D-malate since the anaerobic pathway for D-malate degradation has a 
predicted yield of < or = 0 ATP/mol D-malate. Slow anaerobic growth on D-malate 
was observed when glycerol was also provided as an electron donor, and D-malate 
was used in fumarate respiration. The expression of dmlR is subject to negative 
autoregulation. The network for regulation and coordination of the central and 
peripheral pathways for C(4)-dicarboxylate metabolism by the regulators 
DcuS-DcuR, DmlR, and TtdR is discussed.

The function of the response regulator DcuR of the DcuSR fumarate two-component 
sensory system of Escherichia coli was analysed in vitro. Isolated DcuR protein 
was phosphorylated by the sensory histidine kinase, DcuS, and ATP, or by acetyl 
phosphate. In gel retardation assays with target promoters (frdA, dcuB, dctA), 
phosphoryl DcuR (DcuR-P) formed a high-affinity complex, with an apparent K(D) 
(app. K(D)) of 0.2-0.3 microM DcuR-P, and a low-affinity (app. K(D) 0.8-2 
microM) complex. The high-affinity complex was formed only with promoters 
transcriptionally-regulated by DcuSR, whereas low-affinity binding was seen also 
with some DcuSR-independent promoters. The binding site of DcuR-P at the dcuB 
promoter was determined by DNase I footprinting. One binding site of 42-52 nt 
(position -359 to -400/-410 nt upstream of the transcriptional start) was 
identified in the presence of low and high concentrations of DcuR-P. 
Non-phosphorylated DcuR, or DcuR-D56N mutated in the phosphoryl-accepting Asp56 
residue, showed low-affinity binding to target promoters. DcuR-D56N was still 
able to interact with DcuS. DcuR-D56N increased the phosphorylation of DcuS and 
competitively inhibited phosphoryl transfer to wild-type DcuR.

C4-dicarboxylate carriers and sensors in bacteria.

Janausch IG(1), Zientz E, Tran QH, Kröger A, Unden G.

Author information:
(1)Institut für Mikrobiologie und Weinforschung, Johann Gutenberg-Universität 
Mainz, Germany.

Bacteria contain secondary carriers for the uptake, exchange or efflux of 
C4-dicarboxylates. In aerobic bacteria, dicarboxylate transport (Dct)A carriers 
catalyze uptake of C4-dicarboxylates in a H(+)- or Na(+)-C4-dicarboxylate 
symport. Carriers of the dicarboxylate uptake (Dcu)AB family are used for 
electroneutral fumarate:succinate antiport which is required in anaerobic 
fumarate respiration. The DcuC carriers apparently function in succinate efflux 
during fermentation. The tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) 
transporter carriers are secondary uptake carriers requiring a periplasmic 
solute binding protein. For heterologous exchange of C4-dicarboxylates with 
other carboxylic acids (such as citrate:succinate by CitT) further types of 
carriers are used. The different families of C4-dicarboxylate carriers, the 
biochemistry of the transport reactions, and their metabolic functions are 
described. Many bacteria contain membraneous C4-dicarboxylate sensors which 
control the synthesis of enzymes for C4-dicarboxylate metabolism. The 
C4-dicarboxylate sensors DcuS, DctB, and DctS are histidine protein kinases and 
belong to different families of two-component systems. They contain periplasmic 
domains presumably involved in C4-dicarboxylate sensing. In DcuS the periplasmic 
domain seems to be essential for direct interaction with the C4-dicarboxylates. 
In signal perception by DctB, interaction of the C4-dicarboxylates with DctB and 
the DctA carrier plays an important role.

Characterization of the enzymatic component of the ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin 
CDTa from Clostridium difficile.

Certain strains of Clostridium difficile produce the ADP-ribosyltransferase CDT, 
which is a binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxin. The toxin consists of the 
binding component CDTb, which mediates receptor binding and cellular uptake, and 
the enzyme component CDTa. Here we studied the enzyme component (CDTa) of the 
toxin using the binding component of Clostridium perfringens iota toxin (Ib), 
which is interchangeable with CDTb as a transport component. Ib was used because 
CDTb was not expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. Similar to 
iota toxin, CDTa ADP-ribosylates nonmuscle and skeletal muscle actin. The 
N-terminal part of CDTa (CDTa1-240) competes with full-length CDTa for binding 
to the iota toxin binding component. The C-terminal part (CDTa244-263) harbors 
the enzyme activity but was much less active than the full-length CDTa. Changes 
of Glu428 and Glu430 to glutamine, Ser388 to alanine, and Arg345 to lysine 
blocked ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Comparison of CDTa with C. perfringens 
iota toxin and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin revealed full enzyme activity of 
the fragment Ia208-413 but loss of activity of several N-terminally deleted C2I 
proteins including C2I103-431, C2I190-431, and C2I30-431. The data indicate that 
CDTa belongs to the iota toxin subfamily of binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins 
with respect to interaction with the binding component and substrate 
specificity. It shares typical conserved amino acid residues with iota toxin and 
C2 toxin that are suggested to be involved in NAD-binding and/or catalytic 
activity. The enzyme components of CDT, iota toxin, and C2 toxin differ with 
respect to the minimal structural requirement for full enzyme activity.

DctA- and Dcu-independent transport of succinate in Escherichia coli: 
contribution of diffusion and of alternative carriers.

Author information:
(1)Institut für Mikrobiologie und Weinforschung, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität 
Mainz, Becherweg 15, 55099 Mainz, Germany.

Quintuple mutants of Escherichia coli deficient in the C(4)-dicarboxylate 
carriers of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (DctA, DcuA, DcuB, DcuC, and the 
DcuC homolog DcuD, or the citrate/succinate antiporter CitT) showed only poor 
growth on succinate (or other C(4)-dicarboxylates) under oxic conditions. At 
acidic pH (pH 6) the mutants regained aerobic growth on succinate, but not on 
fumarate. Succinate uptake by the mutants could not be saturated at 
physiological succinate concentrations (< or =5 mM), in contrast to the 
wild-type, which had a K(m) for succinate of 50 microM and a V(max) of 35 U/g 
dry weight at pH 6. At high substrate concentrations, the mutants showed 
transport activities (32 U/g dry weight) comparable to that of the wild-type. In 
the wild-type using DctA as the carrier, succinate uptake had a pH optimum of 6, 
whereas succinate uptake in the mutants was maximal at pH 5. In the mutants 
succinate uptake was inhibited competitively by monocarboxylic acids. Diffusion 
of succinate or fumarate across phospholipid membranes (liposomes) was orders of 
magnitude slower than the transport in the wild-type or the mutants. The data 
suggest that mutants deficient in DctA, DcuA, DcuB, DcuC, DcuD (or CitT) contain 
a carrier, possibly a monocarboxylate carrier, which is able to transport 
succinate, but not fumarate, at acidic pH, when succinate is present as a 
monoanion. Succinate uptake by this carrier was inhibited by addition of an 
uncoupler. Growth by fumarate respiration (requiring fumarate/succinate 
antiport) was also lost in the quintuple mutants, and growth was not restored at 
pH 6. In contrast, the efflux of succinate produced during glucose fermentation 
was not affected in the mutants, demonstrating that, for succinate efflux, a 
carrier different from, or in addition to, the known Dcu and CitT carriers is 
used.

Fumarate regulation of gene expression in Escherichia coli by the DcuSR (dcuSR 
genes) two-component regulatory system.

Zientz E(1), Bongaerts J, Unden G.

Author information:
(1)Institut für Mikrobiologie und Weinforschung, Johannes Gutenberg- Universität 
Mainz, 55099 Mainz, Germany.

In Escherichia coli the genes encoding the anaerobic fumarate respiratory system 
are transcriptionally regulated by C4-dicarboxylates. The regulation is effected 
by a two-component regulatory system, DcuSR, consisting of a sensory histidine 
kinase (DcuS) and a response regulator (DcuR). DcuS and DcuR are encoded by the 
dcuSR genes (previously yjdHG) at 93.7 min on the calculated E. coli map. 
Inactivation of the dcuR and dcuS genes caused the loss of 
C4-dicarboxylate-stimulated synthesis of fumarate reductase (frdABCD genes) and 
of the anaerobic fumarate-succinate antiporter DcuB (dcuB gene). DcuS is 
predicted to contain a large periplasmic domain as the supposed site for 
C4-dicarboxylate sensing. Regulation by DcuR and DcuS responded to the presence 
of the C4-dicarboxylates fumarate, succinate, malate, aspartate, tartrate, and 
maleate. Since maleate is not taken up by the bacteria under these conditions, 
the carboxylates presumably act from without. Genes of the aerobic 
C4-dicarboxylate pathway encoding succinate dehydrogenase (sdhCDAB) and the 
aerobic succinate carrier (dctA) are only marginally or negatively regulated by 
the DcuSR system. The CitAB two-component regulatory system, which is highly 
similar to DcuSR, had no effect on C4-dicarboxylate regulation of any of the 
genes.

The Rhizobium meliloti dctA gene encodes the C4-dicarboxylate permease which 
mediates uptake of C4-dicarboxylates, both in free-living and symbiotic cells. 
Based on the hydrophobicity of the DctA protein, 12 putative membrane spanning 
regions were predicted. The membrane topology was further analysed by isolating 
in vivo fusions of DctA to Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) and E. 
coli beta-galactosidase (LacZ). Of 10 different fusions 7 indicated a 
periplasmic and 3 a cytoplasmic location of the corresponding region of the DctA 
protein. From these data a two-dimensional model of DctA was constructed which 
comprised twelve transmembrane alpha-helices with the amino-terminus and the 
carboxy-terminus located in the cytoplasm. In addition, four conserved amino 
acid motifs present in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic transport proteins were 
observed.

The complete amino acid sequences of 3 proteins from the 50S subunit of Bacillus 
stearothermophilus ribosomes were determined by N-terminal sequence analysis and 
by sequencing of overlapping fragments obtained from enzymatic digestions and 
chemical cleavages. The proteins BstL28, BstL33 and BstL34, named according to 
the equivalent proteins in Escherichia coli ribosomes, consist of 60, 49, and 44 
amino acid residues and have calculated molecular masses of 6811.0, 5908.6, and 
5253.9 Da, respectively. They are highly basic with a content of positively 
charged residues ranging between 29% for L33 and 45% for L34. The 3 proteins 
were positioned in the 2-dimensional map of B stearothermophilus 50S ribosomal 
proteins. The electrophoretic mobilities confirm sizes and net charges deduced 
from the sequences.

The complete amino acid sequences of ribosomal proteins L16, L23 and L33 from 
the archaebacterium Halobacterium marismortui were determined. The sequences 
were established by manual sequencing of peptides produced with several 
proteases as well as by cleavage with dilute HCl. Proteins L16, L23 and L33 
consist of 119, 154 and 69 amino acid residues, and their molecular masses are 
13,538, 16,812 and 7620 Da, respectively. The comparison of their sequences with

related to eubacterial ribosomal proteins from Escherichia coli and Bacillus

ribosomal protein from yeast. These results provide information about the 
special phylogenetic position of archaebacteria.

The complete amino acid sequences of 3 proteins from the 50S subunit of Bacillus 
stearothermophilus ribosomes were determined by N-terminal sequence analysis and 
by sequencing of overlapping fragments obtained from enzymatic digestions and 
chemical cleavages. The proteins BstL28, BstL33 and BstL34, named according to 
the equivalent proteins in Escherichia coli ribosomes, consist of 60, 49, and 44 
amino acid residues and have calculated molecular masses of 6811.0, 5908.6, and 
5253.9 Da, respectively. They are highly basic with a content of positively 
charged residues ranging between 29% for L33 and 45% for L34. The 3 proteins 
were positioned in the 2-dimensional map of B stearothermophilus 50S ribosomal 
proteins. The electrophoretic mobilities confirm sizes and net charges deduced 
from the sequences.

The Staphylococcus carnosus secE gene: cloning, nucleotide sequence, and

A DNA fragment containing the genes secE, nusG and rplK of Staphylococcus 
carnsosus was cloned using the Escherichia coli rplK gene as a probe. The S. 
carnosus secE homologue encodes a protein of 65 amino acid residues which is 
homologous to the carboxyl-terminal region of the E. coli SecE protein. The S. 
carnosus SecE polypeptide which, in contrast to the E. coli SecE protein, 
contains only one putative transmembrane segment, could fully replace the E. 
coli SecE protein in two different secE mutants. These results strongly suggest 
that the identified secE gene encodes an important component of the S. carnosus 
protein export apparatus.

transactivation.

Molecular Biology, Jena, Germany.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) 
and requires additional protein-protein interactions to regulate the expression 
of target genes. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the previously 
described protein L7, that specifically interacted with the VDR in the presence 
of vitamin D. Deletion analysis indicated, that the N-terminus of L7, which 
harbours a basic region leucine zipper like domain, mediated interaction with 
the VDR. Binding assays with purified GST-L7 demonstrated, that L7 specifically 
pulled down the VDR, that was either expressed in yeast or endogenously 
contained in the cell line U937. Interestingly, L7 inhibited ligand-dependent 
VDR-RXR heterodimerization, when constitutively expressed in yeast. We also 
demonstrate that L7 repressed binding of VDR-RXR heterodimers to a vitamin D 
response element. Surprisingly, L7 recruited RXR to the same response element in 
the presence of 9-cis retinoic acid. Ligand-dependent protein-protein 
interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system confirmed, that binding of L7 also 
was targeted at the RXR. Our data suggest, that protein L7 is a coregulator of 
VDR-RXR mediated transactivation of genes, that modulates transcriptional 
activity by interfering with binding of the receptors to genomic enhancer 
elements.

The binding site of ribosomal protein L10 in eubacteria and archaebacteria is 
conserved: reconstitution of chimeric 50S subunits.

Germany.

It has been shown by electron microscopy that the selective removal of the stalk 
from 50S ribosomal subunits of two representative archaebacteria, namely 
Methanococcus vaniellii and Sulfolobus solfataricus, is accompanied by loss of 
the archaebacterial L10 and L12 proteins. The stalk was reformed if 
archaebacterial core particles were reconstituted with their corresponding split 
proteins. Next, structurally intact chimeric 50S subunits have been 
reconstituted in vitro by addition of Escherichia coli ribosomal proteins L10 
and L7/L12 to 50S core particles from M vaniellii or S solfataricus, 
respectively. In the reverse experiment, using core particles from E coli and 
split proteins from M vaniellii, stalk-bearing 50S particles were also obtained. 
Analysis of the reconstituted 50S subunits by immunoblotting revealed that E 
coli L10 was incorporated into archaebacterial core particles in both presence 
or absence of E coli L7/L12. In contrast, incorporation of E coli L7/L12 into 
archaebacterial cores was only possible in the presence of E coli L10. Our 
results suggest that in archaebacteria - as in E coli - the stalk is formed by 
archaebacterial L12 proteins that bind to the ribosome via L10. The structural 
equivalence of eubacterial and archaebacterial L10 and L12 proteins has thus for 
the first time been established. The chimeric reconstitution experiments provide 
evidence that the domain of protein L10 that interacts with the ribosomal 
particle is highly conserved between eubacteria and archaebacteria.

Control of Fur synthesis by the non-coding RNA RyhB and iron-responsive 
decoding.

University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

The Fe2+-dependent Fur protein serves as a negative regulator of iron uptake in 
bacteria. As only metallo-Fur acts as an autogeneous repressor, Fe2+scarcity 
would direct fur expression when continued supply is not obviously required. We 
show that in Escherichia coli post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms ensure 
that Fur synthesis remains steady in iron limitation. Our studies revealed that 
fur translation is coupled to that of an upstream open reading frame (uof), 
translation of which is downregulated by the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) RyhB. As 
RyhB transcription is negatively controlled by metallo-Fur, iron depletion 
creates a negative feedback loop. RyhB-mediated regulation of uof-fur provides 
the first example for indirect translational regulation by a trans-encoded 
ncRNA. In addition, we present evidence for an iron-responsive decoding 
mechanism of the uof-fur entity. It could serve as a backup mechanism of the 
RyhB circuitry, and represents the first link between iron availability and 
synthesis of an iron-containing protein.

Role of Staphylococcus aureus Tet38 in Transport of Tetracycline and Its 
Regulation in a Salt Stress Environment.

Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Staphylococcus aureus Tet38 efflux pump has multiple functions, including 
conferring resistance to tetracycline and other compounds and enabling 
internalization and survival within epithelial cells. In this study, we 
evaluated the effects of sodium and potassium on tet38 expression. These 
monovalent cations are known to play a role in transport by the related S. 
aureus TetK and B. subtilis TetL transporters. tet38 transcription decreased 
with increasing sodium concentrations by means of direct repression by the salt 
stress-dependent KdpD/E regulator. tet38 transcription increased 20-fold and 
tetracycline minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) increased 4-fold in a ΔkdpD 
mutant. KdpE bound specifically to the tet38 promoter. Under extreme salt 
stress, the survival of S. aureus with intact tet38 was reduced compared to that 
of a Δtet38 mutant. To study the effect of sodium on Tet38 function, we 
generated constructs overexpressing tet38 and tetK and introduced them into 
Escherichia coli TO114, which is deficient in major sodium transporters. Tet38 
tetracycline efflux was directly demonstrated in a fluorescence assay, and 
tetracycline efflux of both Tet38 and TetK was abolished by the protonophore 
carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). In contrast, NaCl inhibited 
efflux by Tet38 but not TetK, whereas KCl inhibited efflux by TetK but not 
Tet38. Cell-associated Na increased with heterologous overexpression of Tet38. 
These data indicate that S. aureus Tet38 is a tetracycline efflux pump regulated 
by the KdpD/E regulator. Under salt stress, S. aureus adjusted its survival in 
part by reducing the expression of tet38 through KdpD/E. The mechanisms by which 
Tet38 is detrimental to salt tolerance in S. aureus and inhibited by sodium 
remain to be determined. IMPORTANCE This study shows that S. aureus Tet38 is a 
tetracycline efflux pump regulated by KdpD/E regulator. These findings are the 
first direct demonstration of Tet38-mediated tetracycline efflux, which had 
previously been inferred from its ability to confer tetracycline resistance. 
Under salt stress, S. aureus adjusts its survival in part by reducing the 
expression of tet38 through KdpD/E. We demonstrated the differences in the 
respective functions of S. aureus Tet38 and other tetracycline efflux 
transporters (S. aureus TetK, B. subtilis TetL) regarding their transport of 
tetracycline and Na+/K+. Notably, sodium selectively reduced tetracycline efflux 
by Tet38, and potassium selectively reduced tetracycline efflux by TetK. The 
multiple functions of Tet38 emphasize its importance in bacterial adaptation to 
and survival in diverse environments.

Two-component systems (TCSs), which consist of a histidine kinase (HK) sensor 
and a response regulator (RR), are important for bacteria to quickly sense and 
respond to various environmental signals. HKs and RRs typically function as a 
cognate pair, interacting only with one another to transduce signaling. Precise 
signal transduction in a TCS depends on the specific interactions between the 
receiver domain (RD) of the RR and the dimerization and histidine 
phosphorylation domain (DHp) of the HK. Here, we determined the complex 
structure of KdpDE, a TCS consisting of the HK KdpD and the RR KdpE, which is 
responsible for K+ homeostasis. Both the RD and the DNA binding domain (DBD) of 
KdpE interacted with KdpD. Although the RD of KdpE and the DHp of KdpD 
contributed to binding specificity, the DBD mediated a distinct interaction with 
the catalytic ATP-binding (CA) domain of KdpD that was indispensable for 
KdpDE-mediated signal transduction. Moreover, the DBD-CA interface largely 
overlapped with that of the DBD-DNA complex, leading to competition between KdpD 
and its target promoter in a KdpE phosphorylation-dependent manner. In addition, 
the extended C-terminal tail of the CA domain was critical for stabilizing the 
interaction with KdpDE and for signal transduction. Together, these data provide 
a molecular basis for specific KdpD and KdpE interactions that play key roles in 
efficient signal transduction and transcriptional regulation by this TCS.

KdpD/KdpE two-component signaling system regulates expression of a high affinity 
potassium transporter responsible for potassium homeostasis. The C-terminal 
module of KdpD consists of a GAF domain linked to a histidine kinase domain. 
Whereas certain GAF domains act as regulators by binding cyclic nucleotides, the 
role of the juxtamembrane GAF domain in KdpD is unknown. We report the 
high-resolution crystal structure of KdpD GAF domain (KdpDG ) consisting of five 
α-helices, four β-sheets and two large loops. KdpDG forms a symmetry-related 
dimer, wherein parallelly arranged monomers contribute to a four-helix bundle at 
the dimer-interface, SAXS analysis of KdpD C-terminal module reveals an 
elongated structure that is a dimer in solution. Substitution of conserved 
residues with various residues that disrupt the dimer interface produce a range 
of effects on gene expression demonstrating the importance of the interface in 
inactive to active transitions during signaling. Comparison of ligand binding 
site of the classic cyclic nucleotide-binding GAF domains to KdpDG reveals 
structural differences arising from naturally occurring substitutions in primary 
sequence of KdpDG that modifies the canonical NKFDE sequence motif required for 
cyclic nucleotide binding. Together these results suggest a structural role for 
KdpDG in dimerization and transmission of signal to the kinase domain.

Two-component systems (TCSs) are widespread regulatory systems which can help 
bacteria to control their cellular functions and respond to a diverse range of 
stimuli. The KdpD/KdpE system had been well studied for regulating potassium 
transport and identified as an adaptive regulator involved in the virulence of 
some pathogenic bacteria, but its role in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli 
(APEC) was still unknown. In this study, the mutant strain AE17ΔKdpDE was 
obtained successfully of a clinical APEC isolation AE17 using the lambda Red 
recombinase system and performed the transcriptional sequencing of the wild type 
strain AE17 and the mutant strain AE17ΔKdpDE. The transcriptional sequencing 
results revealed that the KdpD/KdpE two-component system mainly influenced the 
expression of the genes covering metabolic pathways, flagellar assembly, global 
transcription regulator. The expression of some flagellar-related genes 
detecting by quantitative real-time PCR was consistent with the results of 
transcriptional sequencing. Importantly, fewer flagellum of the mutant strain 
AE17ΔKdpDE was observed than AE17 using the transmission electron microscope and 
a decreased motility circle of AE17ΔKdpDE appeared in the semisolid medium. In 
addition, the serum bactericidal assay was carried out with the 
specific-pathogen-free chicken in different dilution and the survival ability in 
the serum of AE17ΔKdpDE was also obviously lower than that of AE17. These 
results suggested that in APEC, the KdpD/KdpE two-component system mainly 
influenced the expression of flagella-related genes, the flagellum formation, 
the motility and antiserum bactericidal activity.

The two-component system KdpD/KdpE governs K+ homeostasis by controlling 
synthesis of the high affinity K+ transporter KdpFABC. When sensing low 
environmental K+ concentrations, the dimeric kinase KdpD autophosphorylates in 
trans and transfers the phosphoryl-group to the response regulator KdpE, which 
subsequently activates kdpFABC transcription. In Escherichia coli, KdpD can also 
be activated by interaction with the non-phosphorylated form of the accessory 
protein PtsN. PtsN stimulates KdpD kinase activity thereby increasing 
phospho-KdpE levels. Here, we analyzed the interplay between KdpD/KdpE and PtsN. 
PtsN binds specifically to the catalytic DHp domain of KdpD, which is also 
contacted by KdpE. Accordingly, PtsN and KdpE compete for binding, providing a 
paradox. Low levels of non-phosphorylated PtsN stimulate, whereas high amounts 
reduce kdpFABC expression by blocking access of KdpE to KdpD. Ligand fishing 
experiments provided insight as they revealed ternary complex formation of 
PtsN/KdpD2 /KdpE in vivo demonstrating that PtsN and KdpE bind different 
protomers in the KdpD dimer. PtsN may bind one protomer to stimulate 
phosphorylation of the second KdpD protomer, which then phosphorylates bound 
KdpE. Phosphorylation of PtsN prevents its incorporation in ternary complexes. 
Interaction with the conserved DHp domain enables PtsN to regulate additional 
kinases such as PhoR.

Two-component signal transduction constitutes the predominant strategy used by 
bacteria to adapt to fluctuating environments. The KdpD/KdpE system is one of 
the most widespread, and is crucial for K+ homeostasis. In Escherichia coli, the 
histidine kinase KdpD senses K+ availability, whereas the response regulator 
KdpE activates synthesis of the high-affinity K+ uptake system KdpFABC. Here we 
show that, in the absence of KdpD, kdpFABC expression can be activated via 
phosphorylation of KdpE by the histidine kinase PhoR. PhoR and its cognate 
response regulator PhoB comprise a phosphate-responsive two-component system, 
which senses phosphate limitation indirectly through the phosphate transporter 
PstCAB and its accessory protein PhoU. In vivo two-hybrid interaction studies 
based on the bacterial adenylate cyclase reveal pairwise interactions between 
KdpD, PhoR, and PhoU. Finally, we demonstrate that cross-regulation between the 
kdpFABC and pstSCAB operons occurs in both directions under simultaneous K+ and 
phosphate limitation, both in vitro and in vivo. This study for the first time 
demonstrates direct coupling between intracellular K+ and phosphate homeostasis 
and provides a mechanism for fine-tuning of the balance between positively and 
negatively charged ions in the bacterial cell.

The KdpD Sensor Kinase of Escherichia coli Responds to Several Distinct Signals 
To Turn on Expression of the Kdp Transport System.

Kdp, one of three saturable K(+) uptake systems in Escherichia coli, is the 
system with the highest affinity for K(+) and the only one whose expression is 
strongly controlled by medium K(+) concentration. Expression is controlled by a 
two-component system of KdpD, the sensor kinase, and KdpE, the response 
regulator. There is general agreement that expression occurs when the growth 
rate of cells begins to become limited by K(+) availability. How K(+) limitation 
results in expression has been controversial. Studying the roles of the major 
components of the growth medium shows that KdpD senses at least two distinct 
signals inside the cell, those of Na(+) and NH4 (+), and it probably senses 
other monovalent cations in the cell. KdpD does not sense turgor.
IMPORTANCE: The expression of the Kdp K(+) transport system of E. coli occurs 
when cells become limited in their growth rate by the availability of K(+). 
Cells sense limited K(+) and try to compensate by taking up other monovalent 
cations, particularly Na(+) and NH4 (+). These cations are sensed in the 
cytoplasm by the KdpD response regulator, presumably to stimulate its kinase 
activity. It is shown that KdpD does not sense turgor, as was suggested earlier.

Modeling the Interplay of Pseudomonas putida EIIA with the Potassium Transporter 
KdpFABC.

The nitrogen phosphotransferase system (PTS(Ntr)) of Pseudomonas putida is a key 
regulatory device that participates in controlling many physiological processes 
in a posttranscriptional fashion. One of the target functions of the PTS(Ntr) is 
the regulation of potassium transport. This is mediated by the direct 
interaction of one of its components with the sensor kinase KdpD of the 
two-component system controlling transcription of the kdpFABC genes. From a 
detailed experimental analysis of the activity of the kdpF promoter in P. putida 
wild-type and pts mutant strains with varying potassium concentrations, we had 
highly time-resolved data at hand, describing the influence of the PTS(Ntr) on 
the transcription of the KdpFABC potassium transporter. Here, this data was used 
to construct a mathematical model based on a black box approach. The model was 
able to describe the data quantitatively with convincing accuracy. The 
qualitative interpretation of the model allowed the prediction of two general 
points describing the interplay between the PTS(Ntr) and the KdpFABC potassium 
transporter: (1) the influence of cell number on the performance of the kdpF 
promoter is mainly by dilution by growth and (2) potassium uptake is regulated 
not only by the activity of the KdpD/KdpE two-component system (in turn 
influenced by PtsN). An additional controller with integrative behavior is 
predicted by the model structure. This suggests the presence of a novel 
physiological mechanism during regulation of potassium uptake with the KdpFABC 
transporter and may serve as a starting point for further investigations.

The sensor kinase/response regulator system KdpD/KdpE of Escherichia coli 
regulates the expression of the kdpFABC operon, encoding the high-affinity 
KdpFABC potassium (K(+) )-transport complex. Additionally, it has been suggested 
that the kdpDE operon itself is subjected to autoregulation by its gene products 
KdpD and KdpE. However, since kdpFABC and kdpDE expression has mainly been 
studied on the transcriptional level, accurate information on absolute amounts 
and the stoichiometric subunit composition of KdpFABC and KdpD/KdpE under K(+) 
-limiting and K(+) -nonlimiting growth conditions are lacking. In this study, we 
used highly sensitive mass spectrometric methods to quantify the amount of 
subunits of the Kdp(F)ABC complex and KdpD/KdpE. Data-dependent shotgun MS was 
used to assess protein coverage and accessible peptides. Absolute amounts of 
Kdp(F)ABC and KdpD/KdpE were quantified by targeted MRM analysis in the presence 
of corresponding heavy labeled standard peptides. Baseline synthesis of 
Kdp(F)ABC and KdpD/KdpE was found to be in the attomolar range under K(+) 
-nonlimiting conditions. Under K(+) -limitation, synthesis of Kdp(F)ABC 
(KdpA:KdpB:KdpC ratio of 1:1:1) was amplified more than 100-fold, whereas only a 
tenfold amplification of KdpD/KdpE (KdpD:KdpE ratio of 1:4) was observed. The 
results obtained provide a solid basis for follow-up studies on the dynamic 
regulation of the Kdp system.

KdpD and KdpE form a histidine kinase/response regulator system that senses K(+) 
limitation and induces the kdpFABC operon, which encodes a high-affinity K(+) 
uptake complex. To define the primary stimulus perceived by KdpD we focused in 
this study on the dynamics of the Kdp response. Escherichia coli cells were 
subjected to severe K(+) limitation, and all relevant parameters of the Kdp 
response, i.e., levels of kdpFABC transcripts and KdpFABC proteins, as well as 
extra- and intracellular K(+) concentrations, were quantitatively analysed over 
time (0 to 180 min). Unexpectedly, induction of kdpFABC was found to follow a 
non-monotonic time-course. To interpret this unusual behaviour, a mathematical 
model that adequately captures the dynamics of the Kdp system was established 
and used for simulations. We found a strong correlation between KdpD/KdpE 
activation and the intracellular K(+) concentration, which is influenced by the 
uptake of K(+) via the KdpFABC complex. Based on these results a model is 
proposed in which KdpD/KdpE phosphorylation is inversely correlated with the 
intracellular K(+) concentration. To corroborate this hypothesis an isogenic 
mutant that produces a defective KdpFABC complex, and the trans-complemented 
mutant that expresses the KtrAB high-affinity K(+) uptake system of Vibrio 
alginolyticus were quantitatively analysed. Experimental data and simulations 
for the mutants consistently support the tight correlation between KdpD/KdpE 
activation and the intracellular K(+) concentration. This study presents a 
striking example of the non-intuitive dynamics of a functional unit comprising 
signalling proteins and a transporter with K(+) as mediator.

The L-valine production strain of Escherichia coli was constructed by rational 
metabolic engineering and stepwise improvement based on transcriptome analysis 
and gene knockout simulation of the in silico genome-scale metabolic network. 
Feedback inhibition of acetohydroxy acid synthase isoenzyme III by L-valine was 
removed by site-directed mutagenesis, and the native promoter containing the 
transcriptional attenuator leader regions of the ilvGMEDA and ilvBN operon was 
replaced with the tac promoter. The ilvA, leuA, and panB genes were deleted to 
make more precursors available for L-valine biosynthesis. This engineered Val 
strain harboring a plasmid overexpressing the ilvBN genes produced 1.31 g/liter 
L-valine. Comparative transcriptome profiling was performed during batch 
fermentation of the engineered and control strains. Among the down-regulated 
genes, the lrp and ygaZH genes, which encode a global regulator Lrp and L-valine 
exporter, respectively, were overexpressed. Amplification of the lrp, ygaZH, and 
lrp-ygaZH genes led to the enhanced production of L-valine by 21.6%, 47.1%, and 
113%, respectively. Further improvement was achieved by using in silico gene 
knockout simulation, which identified the aceF, mdh, and pfkA genes as knockout 
targets. The VAMF strain (Val DeltaaceF Deltamdh DeltapfkA) overexpressing the 
ilvBN, ilvCED, ygaZH, and lrp genes was able to produce 7.55 g/liter L-valine 
from 20 g/liter glucose in batch culture, resulting in a high yield of 0.378 g 
of L-valine per gram of glucose. These results suggest that an industrially 
competitive strain can be efficiently developed by metabolic engineering based 
on combined rational modification, transcriptome profiling, and systems-level in 
silico analysis.

Solid/solution partition coefficient (Kd) and speciation of soil heavy metals 
can be used for predicting their environmental risks. The Kd values and solution 
speciation of soil Cu, Cd and Zn were analyzed in 40 samples of contaminated 
agricultural soils around Jiuhua copper mine in eastern Nanjing city, China. The 
Kd ranges (and mean values) for soil Cu, Cd and Zn are 703-7418 (3453), 
37.3-3963 (940) and 319-17965 (7244) L kg-1, respectively, showing a large 
variability both for metals and soils. The results of differential pulse anodic 
stripping voltammetry (DPASV) indicates that 95.6% solution Cu is bound to 
dissolved organic ligands. About half of the dissolved Zn is DPASV-labile at 
pH<6, while 92.1% solution Zn is in the form of organic complexes at pH>6. 
DPASV-labile Cd is ranged from 22.6 to 98.7% with the mean value of 56.3%. 
Multiple linear regressions indicate that Kd, the dissolved and DPASV-labile 
concentrations of Cd and Zn are mostly influenced by the soil solution pH with 
R2 of 0.50, 0.59 and 0.63, respectively for Cd, and 0.58, 0.72 and 0.64, 
respectively for Zn. Considering the second parameter of corresponding soil 
metal, the linear relationships of Kd with pH were improved with R2 of 0.70 and 
0.73 for Cd and Zn, respectively. However, the solubility of soil Cu was 
insensitive to pH. Only SOC shows a weak relationship to the dissolved Cu with 
R2 of 0.21. As for its Kd, total soil Cu is the most significant factor. But for 
DPASV-labile Cu, no soil parameters were found to be good predictors.

Alterations in the flow of one-carbon units affect KinB-dependent sporulation in 
Bacillus subtilis.

Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA. vdartois@pasteur.fr

Endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis is primarily dependent on the 
phosphorylation of the key transcription factor Spo0A by two major kinases, KinA 
and KinB, thought to be activated by distinct signals. Using a strategy designed 
to detect mutations that specifically affect the signalling pathway to KinB, we 
have isolated a Tn10 insertion mutant in one of two adjacent lrp-like genes 
coding for homologues of the Escherichia coli leucine-responsive regulatory 
protein (Lrp) and another mutant in the glyA gene encoding the serine 
hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT). SHMT catalyses interconversion of serine and 
glycine while transferring the resulting one-carbon unit into the C1 pool 
through methylene tetrahydrofolate. Sporulation experiments performed in a 
series of supplemented media indicated that the role of SHMT in the KinB pathway 
is to feed the pool of C1 units recruited for the biosynthesis of key 
metabolites, which include the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). The 
results of experiments using L-ethionine suggest that SAM is involved in 
post-synthetic methylation reactions or biosynthesis of metabolites that serve 
to activate KinB. Truncated LrpA and LrpB peptides that have retained the 
DNA-binding domain but have lost the C-terminal half of the protein appear to 
act as repressors of glyA transcription and KinB-dependent sporulation. However, 
deletions of lrpA, lrpB or lrpAB have little effect on glyA transcription or 
sporulation through KinB, suggesting that other effectors, such as additional 
Lrp homologues, may act in conjunction with LrpA and LrpB. Our results indicate 
that lrpA-lrpB together with the biosynthetic glyA gene lie on a common 
signalling pathway meant to activate the KinB sensor kinase.

The role of H-NS in one carbon metabolism.

Landgraf JR(1), Levinthal M, Danchin A.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, W Lafayette, IN 47907, 
USA.

The H-NS protein of Escherichia coli regulates the expression of genes involved 
in many general processes such as osmoregulation and virulence. More recently, 
H-NS was shown to exert an effect on ilvIH gene expression in conjunction with 
the leucine responsive regulatory protein (Lrp). We show that H-NS is involved 
in the transcriptional regulation of the kbl/tdh operon, which is also Lrp 
regulated. Insertional inactivation of the hns gene results in two-fold 
derepression of the kbl/tdh operon. This level of expression is sufficient to 
suppress the auxotrophic requirements imposed by a glyA mutation. We show that 
expression of the kbl/tdh operon is temperature controlled and that this control 
is not mediated through H-NS action as has been shown for some other temperature 
controlled genes.

Role of activator site position and a distal UP-element half-site for sigma 
factor selectivity at a CRP/H-NS-activated sigma(s)-dependent promoter in 
Escherichia coli.

Transcription initiation by the stress-associated sigma(S)-containing RNA 
polymerase holoenzyme (E sigma(S)) in Escherichia coli is often subject to 
complex regulation that involves multiple additional regulators and histone-like 
proteins. csiD is a stationary phase-inducible sigma(S)-dependent gene in E. 
coli that requires activation by cAMP-CRP (bound to a site centred at -68.5 
nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site) and is positively 
modulated by the abundant nucleoid-associated proteins H-NS and Lrp. By shifting 
the CRP box to positions between -80.5 and -60.5, we could demonstrate that: (i) 
activation is equally helix phase dependent as at classic class I promoters; 
(ii) E sigma(S) prefers a CRP box location at -68.5/-70.5, whereas E sigma(70) 
is nearly inactive with such an arrangement; and (iii) with the CRP site moved 
to -60.5, transcription can be initiated efficiently by both holoenzymes. The 
csiD promoter region also contains a distal UP-element half-site located 
downstream of the CRP box, as demonstrated by mutational studies, in which this 
element was either eliminated or completed to a full UP-element. The UP-element 
half-site favours E sigma(S)-mediated expression, whereas with the full 
UP-element, nearly wild-type levels of csiD transcription were observed in the 
absence of sigma(S). Finally, we show that the two histone-like proteins, H-NS 
and Lrp, both act by influencing activation by cAMP-CRP, but do so by different 
mechanisms. In particular, H-NS directly or indirectly increases positional 
stringency for the CRP binding site. The implications of these findings with 
respect to sigma factor selectivity, activation mechanisms used by the two 
holoenzymes and the architecture of sigma(S)-dependent promoters are discussed.

Molecular analysis of the regulation of csiD, a carbon starvation-inducible gene 
in Escherichia coli that is exclusively dependent on sigma s and requires 
activation by cAMP-CRP.

The general stress-induced sigma subunit sigma s of Escherichia coli RNA 
polymerase is closely related to the vegetative sigma factor sigma 70. In view 
of their very similar promoter specificity in vitro, it is unclear how sigma 
factor selectivity in the expression of sigma s-dependent genes is generated in 
vivo. The csiD gene is such a strongly sigma s-dependent gene. In contrast to 
sigma s, which is induced in response to many different stresses, csiD, whose 
expression is driven from a single promoter, is induced by carbon starvation 
only. To our knowledge, the csiD promoter is the first characterized promoter 
which is not only exclusively dependent on sigma s-containing RNA polymerase (E 
sigma s), but also requires an activator, cAMP-CRP. In addition, 
leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) acts as a positive modulator of csiD 
expression. Also in vitro, E sigma s is more efficient than E sigma 70 in csiD 
promoter binding, open complex formation and run-off transcription, which might 
be due to the poor match of the csiD -35 region to the sigma 70 consensus and to 
transcription by E sigma s being less dependent on contacts in this region. By 
DNase I protection experiments, a cAMP-CRP binding site centered at -68.5 
nucleotides upstream of the csiD transcriptional start site was identified. 
While cAMP-CRP stimulates E sigma 70 binding, it does not promote open complex 
formation by E sigma 70, but does so in conjunction with E sigma s. With linear 
templates, cAMP-CRP significantly stimulates E sigma s-mediated in vitro 
transcription, whereas transcription by E sigma 70 is negligible and hardly 
stimulated by cAMP-CRP. These findings may reflect different or less stringent 
positional requirements for an activator site for E sigma s than for E sigma 70, 
and indicate that cAMP-CRP contributes to sigma factor selectivity at the csiD 
promoter. In vitro transcription experiments with super-coiled templates, 
however, revealed significant cAMP-CRP-stimulated transcription also by E sigma 
70. Yet, under these conditions, H-NS was found to restore E sigma s specificity 
by strongly interfering with cAMP-CRP/E sigma 70-dependent transcription. Lrp 
strongly and cooperatively binds to multiple sites located between positions -14 
and -102 (in a way that suggests DNA wrapping around multiple Lrp molecules) and 
moderately stimulates in vitro transcription, especially with E sigma s. In 
summary, we conclude that the csiD promoter has an intrinsic preference for E 
sigma s, but that also protein factors such as cAMP-CRP, Lrp and probably H-NS 
as well as DNA conformation contribute to its strong E sigma s selectivity. 
Furthermore, this strong E sigma s preference in combination with a requirement 
for high concentrations of the essential activator cAMP-CRP ensures csiD 
expression under conditions of carbon starvation, but not other stress 
conditions.

Rv2779c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a feast/famine regulatory protein. 
This class of proteins are also known as the leucine-responsive regulatory 
protein/asparagine synthase C family (Lrp/AsnC) of transcriptional regulators 
and are known to be involved in various metabolic processes in bacteria and 
fungi. They contain a RAM (regulator of amino-acid metabolism) domain that is 
rarely found in humans and acts as the oligomerization domain. Since the 
oligomeric status is often linked to the particular functional role in these 
proteins, binding of ligands to the domain can elicit specific functional 
responses. Full-length Rv2779c corresponding to a molecular mass of 19.8 kDa and 
179 residues was cloned and purified to homogeneity following transformation 
into Escherichia coli C41 (DE3) cells. Crystals were grown by vapour diffusion 
using the hanging-drop method. Diffraction data extending to 2.8 Å resolution 
were collected from a single crystal that belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2, 
with unit-cell parameters a = 99.6, b = 146.0, c = 49.9 Å. Matthews coefficient 
(VM) calculations suggest that four molecules are present in the asymmetric 
unit, corresponding to a solvent content of ∼46%. Molecular-replacement 
calculations using the crystal structure of a homologue, Rv3291c, as the search 
model gave an unambiguous solution corresponding to four subunits in the 
asymmetric unit.

The role of nonlinear DNA in replication, recombination, and transcription has 
become evident in recent years. Although several studies have predicted and 
characterized regulatory elements at the sequence level, very few have 
investigated DNA structure as regulatory motifs. Here, using G-quadruplex or G4 
DNA motifs as a model, we have researched the role of DNA structure in 
transcription on a genome-wide scale. Analyses of >61,000 open reading frames 
(ORFs) across 18 prokaryotes show enrichment of G4 motifs in regulatory regions 
and indicate its predominance within promoters of genes pertaining to 
transcription, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and signal transduction. Based 
on this, we predict that G4 DNA may present regulatory signals. This is 
supported by conserved G4 motifs in promoters of orthologous genes across 
phylogenetically distant organisms. We hypothesized a regulatory role of G4 DNA 
during supercoiling stress, when duplex destabilization may result in G4 
formation. This is in line with our observations from target site analysis for 
55 DNA-binding proteins in Escherichia coli, which reveals significant (P<0.001) 
association of G4 motifs with target sites of global regulators FIS and Lrp and 
the sigma factor RpoD (sigma70). These factors together control >1000 genes in 
the early growth phase and are believed to be induced by supercoiled DNA. We 
also predict G4 motif-induced supercoiling sensitivity for >30 operons in E. 
coli, and our findings implicate G4 DNA in DNA-topology-mediated global gene 
regulation in E. coli.

genetic switch. Since then, important data have come to light, including 
additional factors that regulate pap expression, better characterization of H-NS 
regulation, the structure of the Lrp octamer in complex with pap regulatory DNA, 
the temperature-insensitive phenotype of a mutant lacking the acetyltransferase 
RimJ, evidence that key components of the regulatory machinery are acetylated, 
and new insights into the role of DNA binding by key regulators in shaping both 
the physical structure and regulatory state of the papI and papBA promoters. 
This review revisits pap, integrating these newer observations with older ones 
to produce a new model for the concerted behavior of this virulence-regulatory 
region.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a major burden to human health. The 
overwhelming majority of UTIs are caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli 
(UPEC) strains. Unlike some pathogens, UPEC strains do not have a fixed core set 
of virulence and fitness factors but do have a variety of adhesins and 
regulatory pathways. One such UPEC adhesin is the nonfimbrial adhesin TosA, 
which mediates adherence to the epithelium of the upper urinary tract. The tos 
operon is AT rich, resides on pathogenicity island aspV, and is not expressed 
under laboratory conditions. Because of this, we hypothesized that tosA 
expression is silenced by H-NS. Lrp, based on its prominent function in the 
regulation of other adhesins, is also hypothesized to contribute to tos operon 
regulation. Using a variety of in vitro techniques, we mapped both the tos 
operon promoter and TosR binding sites. We have now identified TosR as a dual 
regulator of the tos operon, which could control the tos operon in association 
with H-NS and Lrp. H-NS is a negative regulator of the tos operon, and Lrp 
positively regulates the tos operon. Exogenous leucine also inhibits 
Lrp-mediated tos operon positive regulation. In addition, TosR binds to the pap 
operon, which encodes another important UPEC adhesin, P fimbria. Induction of 
TosR synthesis reduces production of P fimbria. These studies advance our 
knowledge of regulation of adhesin expression associated with uropathogen 
colonization of a host.

FimB and FimE are site-specific recombinases, part of the lambda integrase 
family, and invert a 314 bp DNA switch that controls the expression of type 1 
fimbriae in Escherichia coli. FimB and FimE differ in their activity towards the 
fim switch, with FimB catalysing inversion in both directions in comparison to 
the higher-frequency but unidirectional on-to-off recombination catalysed by 
FimE. Previous work has demonstrated that FimB, but not FimE, recombination is 
completely inhibited in vitro and in vivo by a regulator, PapB, expressed from a 
distinct fimbrial locus. The aim of this work was to investigate differences 
between FimB and FimE activity by exploiting the differential inhibition 
demonstrated by PapB. The research focused on genetic changes to the fim switch 
that alter recombinase binding and its structural context. FimB and FimE still 
recombined a switch in which the majority of fimS DNA was replaced with a larger 
region of non-fim DNA. This demonstrated a minimal requirement for FimB and FimE 
recombination of the Fim binding sites and associated inverted repeats. With the 
original leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and integration host factor 
(IHF)-dependent structure removed, PapB was now able to inhibit both 
recombinases. The relative affinities of FimB and FimE were determined for the 
four 'half sites'. This analysis, along with the effect of extensive swaps and 
duplications of the half sites on recombination frequency, demonstrated that 
FimB recruitment and therefore subsequent activity was dependent on a single 
half site and its context, whereas FimE recombination was less stringent, being 
able to interact initially with two half sites with equally high affinity. While 
increasing FimB recombination frequencies failed to overcome PapB repression, 
mutations made in recombinase binding sites resulted in inhibition of FimE 
recombination by PapB. Overall, the data support a model in which the 
recombinases differ in loading order and co-operative interactions. PapB 
exploits this difference and FimE becomes susceptible when its normal loading is 
restricted or changed.

fimbrial transcription in Escherichia coli.

In uropathogenic Escherichia coli, P pili (Pap) facilitate binding to host 
epithelial cells and subsequent colonization. Whereas P pili can be produced at 
37 degrees C, the expression of these fimbriae is suppressed at 23 degrees C. 
Previously, insertion mutations in rimJ, a gene encoding the N-terminal 
acetyltransferase of ribosomal protein S5, were shown to disrupt this 
thermoregulatory response, allowing papBA transcription at low temperature. In 
this study, we created an in-frame deletion of rimJ. This deletion relieved the 
repressive effects not only of low temperature but also of rich (Luria-Bertani 
[LB]) medium and glucose on papBA transcription, indicating that RimJ modulates 
papBA transcription in response to multiple environmental stimuli. papI 
transcription was also shown to be regulated by RimJ. papBA transcription is 
also controlled by a phase variation mechanism. We demonstrated that the 
regulators necessary to establish a phase ON state--PapI, PapB, Dam, Lrp, and 
cyclic AMP-CAP-are still required for papBA transcription in a rimJ mutant 
strain. rimJ mutations increase the rate at which bacteria transition into the 
phase ON state, indicating that RimJ inhibits the phase OFF-->ON transition. A 
DeltarimJ hns651 mutant is viable on LB medium but not on minimal medium. This 
synthetic lethality, along with transcriptional analyses, indicates that RimJ 
and H-NS work through separate pathways to control papBA transcription. 
Mutations in rimJ do not greatly influence the transcription of the fan, daa, or 
fim operon, suggesting that RimJ may be a pap-specific regulator. Overexpression 
of rimJ under conditions repressive for papBA transcription complements the 
DeltarimJ mutation but has little effect on transcription under activating 
conditions, indicating that the ability of RimJ to regulate transcription is 
environmentally controlled.

The essential role of the promoter-proximal subunit of CAP in pap phase 
variation: Lrp- and helical phase-dependent activation of papBA transcription by 
CAP from -215.

Catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) is essential for the expression of Pap 
pili by uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses 
indicate that binding of cAMP-CAP centred at 215.5 bp upstream of the papBA 
promoter is essential for activation of transcription. CAP-dependent activation 
of papBA requires binding of the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) at 
binding sites that extend from -180 to -149 relative to the start site of papBA. 
Our data indicate that CAP and Lrp bind independently to their respective pap 
DNA sites. Activation of papBA transcription was eliminated by mutations in the 
activating region 1 (AR1) of CAP, but not in the AR2 region, similar to class I 
CAP-dependent promoters. Also, like class I promoters, the C-terminal domain of 
the alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase appears to play a role in transcription 
activation. Moreover, phase variation is strictly dependent upon the helical 
phase of the CAP DNA binding site with respect to the papBA transcription start 
site. Using an 'oriented heterodimer' approach with wild-type and AR1 mutant 
CAPs, it was shown that the AR1 region of the CAP subunit proximal to papBA is 
required for stimulation of papBA transcription, whereas AR1 of the 
promoter-distal subunit is not. Previously, CAP was hypothesized to activate pap 
transcription indirectly by disrupting repression mediated by H-NS. The results 
presented here show that AR1 of the promoter-proximal CAP subunit was required 
for papBA transcription even in the absence of the histone-like protein H-NS. 
These results show that the promoter-proximal subunit of CAP, bound 215.5 bp 
upstream of the papBA transcription start site, plays an active role in 
stimulating papBA transcription, possibly by interacting with the C-terminal 
domain of the alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase.

Role of the biofilm master regulator CsgD in cross-regulation between biofilm 
formation and flagellar synthesis.

CsgD, the master regulator of biofilm formation, activates the synthesis of 
curli fimbriae and extracellular polysaccharides in Escherichia coli. To obtain 
insights into its regulatory role, we have identified a total of 20 novel 
regulation target genes on the E. coli genome by using chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip analysis with a high-density DNA microarray. 
By DNase I footprinting, the consensus CsgD-binding sequence predicted from a 
total of 18 target sites was found to include AAAAGNG(N(2))AAAWW. After a 
promoter-lacZ fusion assay, the CsgD targets were classified into two groups: 
group I genes, such as fliE and yhbT, are repressed by CsgD, while group II 
genes, including yccT and adrA, are activated by CsgD. The fliE and fliEFGH 
operons for flagellum formation are directly repressed by CsgD, while CsgD 
activates the adrA gene, which encodes an enzyme for synthesis of cyclic di-GMP, 
a bacterial second messenger, which in turn inhibits flagellum production and 
rotation. Taking these findings together, we propose that the cell motility for 
planktonic growth is repressed by CsgD, thereby promoting the switch to biofilm 
formation.

The development of acid tolerance response (ATR) as a result of low pH in 
Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) contaminating beef during processing 
is considered a major food safety concern. Thus, in order to explore the 
formation and molecular mechanisms of the tolerance response of E. coli O157:H7 
in a simulated beef processing environment, the resistance of a wild-type (WT) 
strain and its corresponding ΔphoP mutant to acid, heat, and osmotic pressure 
was evaluated. Strains were pre-adapted under different conditions of pH (5.4 
and 7.0), temperature (37 °C and 10 °C), and culture medium (meat extract and 
Luria-Bertani broth media). In addition, the expression of genes related to 
stress response and virulence was also investigated among WT and ΔphoP strains 
under the tested conditions. Pre-acid adaptation increased the resistance of E. 
coli O157:H7 to acid and heat treatment while resistance to osmotic pressure 
decreased. Moreover, acid adaptation in meat extract medium simulating slaughter 
environment increased ATR, whereas pre-adaptation at 10 °C reduced the ATR. 
Furthermore, it was shown that mildly acidic conditions (pH = 5.4) and the 
PhoP/PhoQ two-component system (TCS) acted synergistically to enhance acid and 
heat tolerance in E. coli O157:H7. Additionally, the expression of genes related 
to arginine and lysine metabolism, heat shock, and invasiveness was 
up-regulated, which revealed that the mechanism of acid resistance and 
cross-protection under mildly acidic conditions was mediated by the PhoP/PhoQ 
TCS. Both acid adaptation and phoP gene knockout reduced the relative expression 
of stx1 and stx2 genes which were considered as critical pathogenic factors. 
Collectively, the current findings indicated that ATR could occur in E. coli 
O157:H7 during beef processing. Thus, there is an increased food safety risk due 
to the persistence of tolerance response in the following processing conditions. 
The present study provides a more comprehensive basis for the effective 
application of hurdle technology in beef processing.

Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are widespread types of protein 
machinery, typically consisting of a histidine kinase membrane sensor and a 
cytoplasmic transcriptional regulator that can sense and respond to 
environmental signals. TCSs are responsible for modulating genes involved in a 
multitude of bacterial functions, including cell division, motility, 
differentiation, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and virulence. 
Pathogenic bacteria exploit the capabilities of TCSs to reprogram gene 
expression according to the different niches they encounter during host 
infection. This review focuses on the role of TCSs in regulating the virulence 
phenotype of Shigella, an intracellular pathogen responsible for severe human 
enteric syndrome. The pathogenicity of Shigella is the result of the complex 
action of a wide number of virulence determinants located on the chromosome and 
on a large virulence plasmid. In particular, we will discuss how five TCSs, 
EnvZ/OmpR, CpxA/CpxR, ArcB/ArcA, PhoQ/PhoP, and EvgS/EvgA, contribute to linking 
environmental stimuli to the expression of genes related to virulence and 
fitness within the host. Considering the relevance of TCSs in the expression of 
virulence in pathogenic bacteria, the identification of drugs that inhibit TCS 
function may represent a promising approach to combat bacterial infections.

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli isolates (n = 50) were recovered from 
aquatic ecosystems, which presented high counts of E. coli and metal values 
within the recommended range. These isolates showed different multidrug 
resistance profiles, highlighting the resistance to extended-spectrum 
cephalosporins, polymyxins, and fluoroquinolones. Several antimicrobial 
resistance genes (ARGs) were found, spotlighting the presence of at least one 
β-lactamase-encoding gene in each E. coli isolate. Substitutions in the 
quinolone resistance-determining regions and the two-component systems involving 
PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB were also found. The metal tolerance gene rcnA (nickel 
and cobalt efflux pump) was the most prevalent. In this regard, 94% of E. coli 
isolates presented the co-occurrence of at least one ARG and metal tolerance 
gene. Furthermore, virulence genes and genetic diversity were found among MDR E. 
coli isolates. The emergence of potentially pathogenic isolates exhibiting 
multidrug resistance and metal tolerance emerged as a global health problem at 
the human-animal-environment interface.

Colistin is the last line of defense for the treatment of multidrug-resistant 
gram-negative bacterial infections. However, colistin resistance is gradually 
increasing worldwide, with resistance commonly regulated by two-component system 
and mcr gene. Thus, this study aimed to investigate molecular epidemiology and 
colistin-resistant mechanism of mcr-positive and mcr-negative Escherichia coli 
isolates from animal in Sichuan Province, China. In this study, a total of 101 
colistin-resistant E. coli strains were isolated from 300 fecal samples in six 
farms in Sichuan Province. PCR was used to detect mcr gene (mcr-1 to mcr-9). The 
prevalence of mcr-1 in colistin-resistant E. coli was 53.47% (54/101), and the 
prevalence of mcr-3 in colistin-resistant E. coli was 10.89% (11/101). The 
colistin-resistant E. coli and mcr-1-positive E. coli showed extensive 
antimicrobial resistance profiles. For follow-up experiments, we used 30 
mcr-negative and 30 mcr-1-positive colistin-resistant E. coli isolates and E. 
coli K-12 MG1655 model strain. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) of 30 strains 
carrying mcr-1 as detected by PCR identified revealed six strains (20%) of ST10 
and three strains (10%) of each ST206, ST48, and ST155 and either two (for ST542 
and 2539) or just one for all other types. The conjugation experiment and 
plasmid replicon type analysis suggest that mcr-1 was more likely to be 
horizontally transferred and primarily localized on IncX4-type and IncI2-type 
plasmid. The ST diversity of the mcr-1 indicated a scattered and non-clonal 
spreading in mcr-1-positive E. coli. Twenty-eight mcr-negative 
colistin-resistant E. coli isolates carried diverse amino acid alterations in 
PmrA, PmrB, PhoP, PhoQ, and MgrB, whereas no mutation was found in the remaining 
isolates. The finding showed the high prevalence of colistin resistance in 
livestock farm environments in Sichuan Province, China. Our study demonstrates 
that colistin resistance is related to chromosomal point mutations including the 
two-component systems PhoP/PhoQ, PmrA/PmrB, and their regulators MgrB. These 
point mutations may confer colistin resistance in mcr-negative E. coli. These 
findings help in gaining insight of chromosomal-encoded colistin resistance in 
E. coli.

Nematicidal potential of the common plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae has been 
recently identified against Caenorhabditis elegans. The current study was 
designed to investigate the detailed genetic mechanism of the bacterial 
pathogenicity by applying comparative genomics, transcriptomics, mutant library 
screening, and protein expression. Results showed that P. syringae strain MB03 
could kill C. elegans in the liquid assay by gut colonization. The genome of P. 
syringae MB03 was sequenced and comparative analysis including multi locus 
sequence typing, and genome-to-genome distance placed MB03 in phylogroup II of 
P. syringae. Furthermore, comparative genomics of MB03 with nematicidal strains 
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1 and PA14) predicted 115 potential virulence 
factors in MB03. However, genes for previously reported nematicidal metabolites, 
such as phenazine, pyochelin, and pyrrolnitrin, were found absent in the MB03 
genome. Transcriptomics analysis showed that the growth phase of the pathogen 
considerably affected the expression of virulence factors, as genes for the 
flagellum, glutamate ABC transporter, phoP/phoQ, fleS/fleR, type VI secretion 
system, and serralysin were highly up-regulated when stationary phase MB03 cells 
interacted with C. elegans. Additionally, screening of a transposon insertion 
mutant library led to the identification of other nematicidal genes such as 
acnA, gltP, oprD, and zapE. Finally, the nematicidal activity of selected 
proteins was confirmed by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli.

Colistin is considered as one of a last resort antimicrobial agent against 
multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the recent emergence of colistin resistance 
(ColR) worldwide that severely restricts therapeutic options is a serious threat 
to global public health. In this study we have investigated the molecular 
determinants in ColR K. pneumoniae isolates collected from clinical specimens. A 
total of 98 E. coli and 195 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates were collected from 
two hospitals from August 2018 to December 2019 in Tehran, Iran. Colistin 
susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined 
according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute by disk diffusion 
method, and microdilution method, respectively. For isolates with colistin MIC 
≥4 μg mL-1, PCR was performed for the detection of mcr-1 to mcr-4 genes. 
Moreover, nucleotide sequences of mgrB, phoP, phoQ, pmrA, and pmrB genes were 
determined by sequencing. Finally, the transcriptional level of pmrK and pmrC 
genes was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). None of 
the E. coli isolates were resistant to colistin while 21 out 195 K. pneumoniae 
isolates were identified as resistant, 19 of which carried mutation in the mgrB 
gene. Three different mutations were observed in the pmrB gene in 3 K. 
pneumoniae isolates. None of the ColR isolates showed alternations in pmrA, 
phoP, and phoQ genes. Furthermore, none of the plasmid-encoding genes were 
detected. Transcriptional level of the pmrK gene increased in all ColR isolates 
meanwhile, pmrC overexpression was detected in 16 out 21 (76.19%) isolates. 
Eventually, all ColR isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. Our results 
demonstrated that the alternation of mgrB gene is the main mechanism related to 
colistin resistance among ColR K. pneumoniae isolates in this study.

Carbapenem and colistin-resistant bacteria represent a global public health 
problem. Refugees carrying these bacteria and living in inadequate shelters can 
spread these microorganisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
intestinal carriage of these bacteria in Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Between 
June and July 2019, 250 rectal swabs were collected from two refugee camps in 
North Lebanon. Swabs were cultured on different selective media. Antibiotic 
susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. 
Carbapenemase-encoding genes and mcr genes were investigated using real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
Epidemiological relatedness was studied using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). 
From 250 rectal swabs, 16 carbapenem-resistant, 5 colistin-resistant, and 4 
colistin and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were isolated. The isolates 
exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. Seven Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates 
harboured the blaOXA-48 gene, and in addition four K. pneumoniae had mutations 
in the two component systems pmrA/pmrB, phoP/phoQ and co-harboured the blaNDM-1 
gene. Moreover, the blaNDM-1 gene was detected in six Escherichia coli and three 
Enterobacter cloacae isolates. The remaining five E. coli isolates harboured the 
mcr-1 gene. MLST results showed several sequence types, with a remarkable clonal 
dissemination. An urgent strategy needs to be adopted in order to avoid the 
spread of such resistance in highly crowded underserved communities.

The increased and inappropriate use of colistin led to the emergence of its 
resistance among Gram-negative bacterial isolates and the most common mechanism 
of colistin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is the modification of the 
lipopolysaccharide mediated by two-component regulatory systems, PhoPQ and 
PmrAB. The aim of the present study was to investigate the transcriptional 
expression of the PhoPQ system against colistin stress in clinical isolates of 
Escherichia coli with colistin-resistant phenotype. Six colistin-resistant E. 
coli isolates were obtained from Silchar Medical College and Hospital, Silchar 
that were of clinical origin and received for routine culture and sensitivity 
testing. Screening for colistin resistance was done by broth microdilution 
method and further screened for the presence of the different types of 
plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mcr genes namely, mcr-1 to mcr-10 by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The screened positive isolates were subjected 
to PCR assay targeting phoP and phoQ genes and their expression was measured by 
quantitative real-time PCR. The results of this study revealed that two E. coli 
isolates (TS2 and TS4) were found to carry the mcr-1 gene. PhoP and PhoQ gene 
amplification was observed in all the isolates. Transcriptional analysis showed 
that the isolates harboring the mcr-1 gene showed an enhanced level of 
expression in the PhoP, PhoQ genes in the presence of a subinhibitory 
concentration of colistin whereas no significant expression was observed for the 
isolates which were devoid of the mcr gene. This study demonstrates the 
involvement of mcr-1 in the PhoPQ system in clinical isolates of 
colistin-resistant E. coli which will help in designing a molecular marker for 
detecting colistin-resistant E. coli and contribute to the assessment of 
resistance burden and infection control strategy.

OBJECTIVE: The spread of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1 
poses a significant public health threat. Little information is available on the 
development of high-level colistin-resistant mutants (HLCRMs) in MCR-1-producing 
Escherichia coli (MCRPEC). The present study was designed to evaluate the impact 
of chromosomal modifications in pmrAB, phoPQ, and mgrB combined with mcr-1 on 
colistin resistance in E. coli.
METHODS: Five MCRPEC and three non-MCRPEC (E. coli ATCC25922 and two 
plasmid-curing) strains were used. The HLCRMs were selected through 
multi-stepwise colistin exposure. Moreover, two E. coli C600-pMCRs were 
constructed and used for selection of HLCRMs. Further analysis included mutation 
rates and DNA sequencing. Transcripts of pmrABC, phoP, mgrB, and mcr-1 were 
quantified by real-time quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: All tested HLCRMs were successfully isolated from their parental 
strains. Non-MCRPEC strains had higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 
and mutation rates than MCRPEC strains. Nineteen amino acid substitutions were 
identified: seven in PmrA, six in PmrB, one in PhoP, three in PhoQ, and two in 
MgrB. Most were detected in non-MCRPEC strains. Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant 
predicted that four substitutions, PmrA Gly15Arg, Gly53Arg, PmrB Pro94Gln, and 
PhoP Asp86Gly, affected protein function. Two HLCRM isolates did not show amino 
acid substitutions in contrast to their parental MCRPEC isolates. No further 
mutations were detected in the second- and third-step mutants. Further 
transcriptional analysis showed that the up-regulation of pmrCAB expression was 
greater in the mutant of E. coli C600 than in E. coli C600-pMCR.
CONCLUSION: Acquisition of the mcr-1 gene had a negative impact on the 
development of HLCRMs in E. coli, but was associated with low-level colistin 
resistance. Thus, colistin-based combination regimens may be effective against 
infections with MCR-1-producing isolates.

After several decades of use, trimethoprim (TMP) remains one of the key access 
antimicrobial drugs listed by the World Health Organization. To circumvent the 
problem of trimethoprim resistance worldwide, a better understanding of 
drug-resistance mechanisms is required. In this study, we screened the 
single-gene knockout library of Escherichia coli, and identified mgrB and other 
several genes involved in trimethoprim resistance. Subsequent comparative 
transcriptional analysis between ΔmgrB and the wild-type strain showed that 
expression levels of phoP, phoQ, and folA were significantly upregulated in 
ΔmgrB. Further deleting phoP or phoQ could partially restore trimethoprim 
sensitivity to ΔmgrB, and co-overexpression of phoP/Q caused TMP resistance, 
suggesting the involvement of PhoP/Q in trimethoprim resistance. 
Correspondingly, MgrB and PhoP were shown to be able to modulated folA 
expression in vivo. After that, efforts were made to test if PhoP could directly 
modulate the expression of folA. Though phosphorylated PhoP could bind to the 
promotor region of folA in vitro, the former only provided a weak protection on 
the latter as shown by the DNA footprinting assay. In addition, deleting the 
deduced PhoP box in ΔmgrB could only slightly reverse the TMP resistance 
phenotype, suggesting that it is less likely for PhoP to directly modulate the 
transcription of folA. Taken together, our data suggested that, in E. coli, MgrB 
affects susceptibility to trimethoprim by modulating the expression of folA with 
the involvement of PhoP/Q. This work broadens our understanding of the 
regulation of folate metabolism and the mechanisms of TMP resistance in 
bacteria.

The PhoP/PhoQ two-component system stabilizes the alternative sigma factor RpoS 
in Salmonella enterica.

The sigma factor RpoS regulates the expression of many stress response genes and 
is required for virulence in several bacterial species. We now report that RpoS 
accumulates when Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is growing 
logarithmically in media with low Mg(2+) concentrations. This process requires 
the two-component regulatory system PhoP/PhoQ, which is specifically activated 
in low Mg(2+). We show that PhoP controls RpoS protein turnover by serving as a 
transcriptional activator of the iraP (yaiB) gene, which encodes a product that 
enhances RpoS stability by interacting with RssB, the protein that normally 
delivers RpoS to the ClpXP protease for degradation. Mutation of the phoP gene 
rendered Salmonella as sensitive to hydrogen peroxide as an rpoS mutant after 
growth in low Mg(2+). In Escherichia coli, low Mg(2+) leads to only modest RpoS 
stabilization, and iraP is not regulated by PhoP/PhoQ. These findings add the 
sigma factor RpoS to the regulatory proteins and two-component systems that are 
elevated in a PhoP/PhoQ-dependent fashion when Salmonella face low Mg(2+) 
environments. Our data also exemplify the critical differences in regulatory 
circuits that exist between the closely related enteric bacteria Salmonella and 
E. coli.

Bacteria exposed to stress survive by regulating the expression of several genes 
at the transcriptional and translational levels. For instance, in Escherichia 
coli, when growth is arrested in response to stress, such as nutrient 
starvation, the anti-sigma factor Rsd is expressed to inactivate the global 
regulator RpoD and activate the sigma factor RpoS. However, ribosome modulation 
factor (RMF) expressed in response to growth arrest binds to 70S ribosomes to 
form inactive 100S ribosomes and inhibit translational activity. Moreover, 
stress due to fluctuations in the concentration of metal ions essential for 
various intracellular pathways is regulated by a homeostatic mechanism involving 
metal-responsive transcription factors (TFs). Therefore, in this study, we 
examined the binding of a few metal-responsive TFs to the promoter regions of 
rsd and rmf through promoter-specific TF screening and studied the effects of 
these TFs on the expression of rsd and rmf in each TF gene-deficient E. coli 
strain through quantitative PCR, Western blot imaging, and 100S ribosome 
formation analysis. Our results suggest that several metal-responsive TFs (CueR, 
Fur, KdpE, MntR, NhaR, PhoP, ZntR, and ZraR) and metal ions (Cu2+, Fe2+, K+, 
Mn2+, Na+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) influence rsd and rmf gene expression while 
regulating transcriptional and translational activities.

The KdpD/KdpE two-component system: integrating K⁺ homeostasis and virulence.

(1)Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, United 
Kingdom.

The two-component system (TCS) KdpD/KdpE, extensively studied for its regulatory 
role in potassium (K(+)) transport, has more recently been identified as an 
adaptive regulator involved in the virulence and intracellular survival of 
pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, entero-haemorrhagic 
Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia pestis, Francisella species, 
Photorhabdus asymbiotica, and mycobacteria. Key homeostasis requirements 
monitored by KdpD/KdpE and other TCSs such as PhoP/PhoQ are critical to survival 
in the stressful conditions encountered by pathogens during host interactions. 
It follows these TCSs may therefore acquire adaptive roles in response to 
selective pressures associated with adopting a pathogenic lifestyle. Given the 
central role of K(+) in virulence, we propose that KdpD/KdpE, as a regulator of 
a high-affinity K(+) pump, has evolved virulence-related regulatory functions. 
In support of this hypothesis, we review the role of KdpD/KdpE in bacterial 
infection and summarize evidence that (i) KdpD/KdpE production is correlated 
with enhanced virulence and survival, (ii) KdpE regulates a range of virulence 
loci through direct promoter binding, and (iii) KdpD/KdpE regulation responds to 
virulence-related conditions including phagocytosis, exposure to microbicides, 
quorum sensing signals, and host hormones. Furthermore, antimicrobial stress, 
osmotic stress, and oxidative stress are associated with KdpD/KdpE activity, and 
the system's accessory components (which allow TCS fine-tuning or crosstalk) 
provide links to stress response pathways. KdpD/KdpE therefore appears to be an 
important adaptive TCS employed during host infection, promoting bacterial 
virulence and survival through mechanisms both related to and distinct from its 
conserved role in K(+) regulation.

Mutation of the PhoP/Q two-component system decreases the expression of ybjX and 
pagP encoding outer membrane proteins, and mutation of ybjX or pagP attenuates 
avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) pathogenicity. However, whether 
ybjX/pagP mutation (double-deletion mutant) has a synergistic effect on 
pathogenicity remains unknown. Herein, electrophoresis mobility shift assay 
(EMSA) experiments showed that the PhoP/Q system regulated ybjX and pagP 
transcription indirectly. The APECΔybjX/pagP mutant strain, constructed using 
the Red recombination method, exhibited reduced invasion of chicken embryo 
fibroblast (DF-1) cells, but had no effect on virulence in a chicken model. 
Using RNA sequencing to identify differential mRNAs in APECΔybjXΔpagP and native 
strains, we revealed up-regulation of genes involved in the bacterial chemotaxis 
pathway. The ybjX/pagP mutant strain displayed significantly increased motility, 
suggesting that double deletion of ybjX and pagP enhances motility via the 
bacterial chemotaxis pathway.

Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) are important pathogens that cause 
serious economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. The PhoP/Q system is 
essential for APEC pathogenicity, and its mutation leads to a decrease in ybjX 
gene expression, but whether ybjX regulated by PhoP/Q plays a role in 
pathogenicity remains unclear. The role of ybjX in APEC pathogenicity was 
investigated using a ybjX mutant strain constructed from APEC strain AE17 by the 
Red recombination method. The mutant strain displayed significantly reduced 
adherence to and invasion of chicken embryo fibroblast cell line (DF-1) cells. 
Moreover, N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) assays revealed an increase in outer 
membrane permeabilization for the ybjX mutant, suggesting ybjX affected 
susceptibility to avian beta-defensin through this mechanism. The ybjX mutation 
increased susceptibility to avian beta-defensin 9 (AvBD9), and in vivo LD50 
assays revealed reduced bacterial virulence in a chicken model. Taken together, 
these results indicated that mutation of ybjX may attenuate APEC pathogenicity, 
not only by affecting bacterial adhesion and invasion, but also via reducing 
resistance to avian beta-defensin by increasing outer membrane permeabilization 
of bacteria.

We studied a collection of 79 colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates 
isolated from diseased pigs in France between 2009 and 2013. We determined a 
number of phenotypic and genetic characters using broth microdilution to 
characterize their antimicrobial susceptibility. We performed pulse field gel 
electrophoresis (PFGE) to assess their genetic diversity and assign them to 
phylogroups. High-throughput real-time PCR micro-array was used to screen for a 
selection of genetic markers of virulence, and PCR and sequencing of the main 
recognized resistance genes allowed us to investigate the mechanisms of colistin 
resistance. Results showed that isolates belonged to several phylogroups and 
most had a unique PFGE profile. More than 50% of the isolates were also 
resistant to sulfonamides, trimethoprim, tetracycline, ampicillin or 
chloramphenicol. The mcr-1 gene was detected in 70 out of 79 isolates and was 
transferred by conjugation in 33 of them, sometimes together with resistance to 
sulfonamides, trimethoprim, tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, 
cefotaxime, or gentamicin. Mutations in the amino-acid sequences of proteins 
MgrB, PhoP, PhoQ, PmrB, but not PmrA, were detected in isolates with or without 
the mcr-1 gene. More than one-third of the isolates harbored the F18, F4, astA, 
hlyA, estI, estII, elt, stx2e, iha, orfA, orfB, paa, terE, ecs1763, or ureD 
virulence markers. In conclusion, although most isolates had a unique PFGE 
profile, a few particular combinations of phylogenetic groups, virulence genes 
and mutations in the sequenced genes involved in colistin resistance were 
identified on a number of occasions, suggesting the persistence of certain 
isolates over several years.

Drug efflux systems play a major role in resistance to a wide range of noxious 
compounds in several Gram negative species. Here, we report the drug resistance 
and virulence phenotypes of Salmonella mutants defective in either 
resistance-nodulation-division (RND)-type systems and/or in drug efflux systems 
belonging to the major facilitator (MFS), multidrug and toxic compound extrusion 
(MATE), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamilies. We determined that nine 
potential drug transporters contribute to drug resistance of Salmonella and 
found that the Salmonella-specific MdsABC system conferred resistance to a 
variety of toxic compounds. The RND-type MdsAB system could function with either 
MdsC, which is encoded in the same operon, or TolC as the outer membrane 
component. Although the Salmonella EmrAB, MdfA and MdtK are 90% identical in 
their amino acid sequences to their Escherichia coli homologues, the drug 
specificity of Salmonella transporters was different from that reported for 
equivalent E. coli transporters. Deletion of the macAB genes attenuated 
Salmonella virulence and a strain lacking all drug efflux systems was avirulent 
when mice were inoculated by the oral route. The promoter region of the macAB 
drug efflux system genes harbours a binding site for the response regulator 
PhoP, which functions to repress macAB transcription. The PhoP/PhoQ 
two-component system is a major regulator of Salmonella virulence, which 
underscores the connection between drug efflux systems and virulence.

Roles of hilC and hilD in regulation of hilA expression in Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium.

Lucas RL(1), Lee CA.

Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Sequences between -332 and -39 upstream of the hilA promoter are required for 
repression of hilA. An unidentified repressor is thought to bind these upstream 
repressing sequences (URS) to inhibit hilA expression. Two AraC-like 
transcriptional regulators encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1), 
HilC and HilD, bind to the URS to counteract the repression of hilA. The URS is 
required for regulation of hilA by osmolarity, oxygen, PhoP/PhoQ, and SirA/BarA. 
Here, we show that FadD, FliZ, PhoB, and EnvZ/OmpR also require the URS to 
regulate hilA. These environmental and regulatory factors may affect hilA 
expression by altering the expression or activity of HilC, HilD, or the unknown 
repressor. To begin investigating these possibilities, we tested the effects of 
environmental and regulatory factors on hilC and hilD expression. We also 
examined hilA regulation when hilC or hilD was disrupted or expressed to a high 
level. Although hilC is regulated by all environmental conditions and regulatory 
factors that modulate hilA expression, hilC is not required for the regulation 
of hilA by any conditions or factors except EnvZ/OmpR. In contrast, hilD is 
absolutely required for hilA expression, but environmental conditions and 
regulatory factors have little or no effect on hilD expression. We speculate 
that EnvZ/OmpR regulates hilA by altering the expression and/or activity of 
hilC, while all other regulatory conditions and mutations regulate hilA by 
modulating hilD posttranscriptionally. We also discuss models in which the 
regulation of hilA expression is mediated by modulation of the expression or 
activity of one or more repressors.

Signal-dependent requirement for the co-activator protein RcsA in transcription 
of the RcsB-regulated ugd gene.

Mouslim C(1), Latifi T, Groisman EA.

(1)Department of Molecular Microbiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute,

The RcsC/YojN/RcsB phosphorelay system controls gene expression in response to a 
variety of signals, including changes in temperature, osmolarity, and 
overproduction of membrane proteins. Transcription of certain RcsB-activated 
genes, such as the capsule synthesis cps operon, requires the co-activator 
protein RcsA, whereas expression of other RcsB-activated genes is 
RcsA-independent. We have established previously that a tolB mutation induces 
transcription of the Salmonella UDP-glucose dehydrogenase ugd gene in an RcsA- 
and RcsB-dependent manner. This induction is independent of the two-component 
systems PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB, which are required for ugd expression in 
response to low Mg2+. We now report that the RcsC/YojN/RcsB system is activated 
in a pmrA mutant experiencing Fe3+ and low Mg2+, resulting in expression of both 
cps and ugd genes. However, whereas cps transcription remained RcsA-dependent, 
ugd transcription became RcsA-independent but dependent on the PhoP protein. S1 
mapping experiments demonstrated that RcsA-dependent and -independent 
transcription of the ugd gene use the same promoter. DNase footprinting analysis 
identified a PhoP-binding site in the ugd promoter. Yet, PhoP-mediated ugd 
transcription required either the RcsC/YojN/RcsB or the PmrA/PmrB systems.

The Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) consists of closely related bacteria 
commonly associated with the human microbiota. ECC are increasingly isolated 
from healthcare-associated infections, demonstrating that these 
Enterobacteriaceae are emerging nosocomial pathogens. ECC can rapidly acquire 
multidrug resistance to conventional antibiotics. Cationic antimicrobial 
peptides (CAMPs) have served as therapeutic alternatives because they target the 
highly conserved lipid A component of the Gram-negative outer membrane. Many 
Enterobacteriaceae fortify their outer membrane with cationic amine-containing 
moieties to prevent CAMP binding, which can lead to cell lysis. The PmrAB 
two-component system (TCS) directly activates 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose 
(l-Ara4N) biosynthesis to result in cationic amine moiety addition to lipid A in 
many Enterobacteriaceae such as E. coli and Salmonella. In contrast, PmrAB is 
dispensable for CAMP resistance in E. cloacae. Interestingly, some ECC clusters 
exhibit colistin heteroresistance, where a subpopulation of cells exhibit 
clinically significant resistance levels compared to the majority population. We 
demonstrate that E. cloacae lipid A is modified with l-Ara4N to induce CAMP 
heteroresistance and the regulatory mechanism is independent of the PmrABEcl 
TCS. Instead, PhoPEcl binds to the arnBEcl promoter to induce l-Ara4N 
biosynthesis and PmrAB-independent addition to the lipid A disaccharolipid. 
Therefore, PhoPQEcl contributes to regulation of CAMP heteroresistance in some 
ECC clusters.

Polymyxins are a class of cyclic peptides with antimicrobial activity against 
Gram-negative bacteria. In Enterobacteriaceae, the PhoQ/PhoP and PmrB/PmrA 
two-component systems regulate many genes that confer resistance to both 
polymyxins and host antimicrobial peptides. The activities of these 
two-component systems are modulated by additional proteins that are conserved 
across Enterobacteriaceae, such as MgrB, a negative regulator of PhoQ, and PmrD, 
a "connector" protein that activates PmrB/PmrA in response to PhoQ/PhoP 
stimulation. Despite the conservation of many protein components of the 
PhoQ/PhoP-PmrD-PmrB/PmrA network, the specific molecular interactions and 
regulatory mechanisms vary across different genera. Here, we explore the role of 
PmrD in modulating this signaling network in Klebsiella pneumoniae and 
Escherichia coli We show that in K. pneumoniae, PmrD is not required for 
polymyxin resistance arising from mutation of mgrB-the most common cause of 
spontaneous polymyxin resistance in this bacterium-suggesting that direct 
activation of polymyxin resistance genes by PhoQ/PhoP plays a critical role in 
this resistance pathway. However, for conditions of low pH or intermediate iron 
concentrations, both of which stimulate PmrB/PmrA, we find that PmrD does 
contribute to resistance. We further show that in E. coli, PmrD functions as a 
connector between PhoQ/PhoP and PmrB/PmrA, in contrast with previous reports. In 
this case, activity also depends on PmrB/PmrA stimulation, or on very high 
activation of PhoQ/PhoP. Our results indicate that the importance of the PmrD 
connector in modulating the polymyxin resistance network depends on both the 
network organization and on the environmental conditions associated with PmrB 
stimulation.

Molecular basis of bile-salt- and iron-induced enterohaemorrhagic E. coli 
resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides.

Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia 
coli (EHEC) is critically dependent on its ability to sense and respond to 
various microenvironments within the host. EHEC exposure to physiologically 
relevant levels of bile salts upregulates the two-component system, pmrAB, and 
the arnBCADTEF operon, resulting in lipopolysaccharide modification and 
increased resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptide, polymyxin B (PMB). A 
similar pmrAB- and arn-dependent PMB resistance has been observed in Salmonella 
enterica in the presence of ferric iron. Limiting magnesium levels and mild acid 
can also induce Salmonella resistance to PMB through another two-component 
system, PhoPQ and the connector protein, PmrD. This study aims to evaluate the 
relative contributions of a bile-salt mix (BSM), iron, limiting magnesium as 
well as the roles of pmrAB, phoPQ and pmrD to EHEC's resistance to PMB. Killing 
assays show that EHEC treatment with the BSM or iron under excess magnesium and 
neutral pH conditions induces a pmrAB-dependent, phoP-independent PMB 
resistance. By contrast, exposure to limiting magnesium triggers a pmrB-, phoP- 
and pmrD-dependent PMB resistance. The iron-induced PMB resistance is 
independent of phoP and pmrD under limiting magnesium conditions while the 
bile-salt-induced PMB resistance is independent of pmrD only under 
non-PhoP-inducing conditions. GFP-pmrD transcriptional reporter studies reveal 
that the limiting magnesium enhances pmrD expression, which is repressed upon 
additional exposure to either BSM or iron. Our results also show that exposure 
to mild acid enhances PMB resistance in a pmrD-independent manner and GFP 
reporter results confirm minimal expression of pmrD at this pH regardless of the 
magnesium level. This study provides novel insights into how EHEC differentially 
employs PmrAB, PhoPQ and PmrD to monitor and respond to bile salts, iron, acidic 
pH and magnesium typically encountered within the gastrointestinal tract in 
order to modulate its survival against cationic antimicrobial peptides.

PURPOSE: Colistin resistance in gram-negative bacteria from humans and livestock 
has been increasingly reported worldwide. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the underlying mechanisms of chromosome-mediated colistin resistance 
in Escherichia coli isolates from livestock in Korea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty mcr-1-negative isolates were selected from a 
collection of colistin-resistant E. coli isolates collected from livestock in 
2005 and 2015 in Korea. Amino acid alterations in PmrAB, PhoPQ, MgrB, and PmrD 
were investigated. Colistin-resistant derivatives were produced by serial 
passage of colistin-susceptible E. coli isolates in colistin-containing media.
RESULTS: Thirty colistin-resistant mcr-negative E. coli isolates were classified 
into 26 sequence types. Twenty-two isolates carried diverse amino acid 
alterations in PmrB, PhoP, PhoQ, MgrB, and/or PmrD, whereas no mutation in any 
of these genes was found in the remaining eight isolates. Sixteen out of the 22 
isolates shared a total of nine polymorphic positions that were found in 
colistin-susceptible E. coli strains. Colistin-resistant derivatives from two 
colistin-susceptible isolates showed the same genetic alterations that were 
observed in colistin-resistant clinical isolates.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the mechanism underlying 
chromosome-mediated colistin resistance remain to be discovered in E. coli. 
Selective pressure of colistin in vitro induced the same genetic mutations 
associated with colistin resistance in vivo. Efforts to reduce colistin 
consumption in livestock should be redoubled, to prevent the occurrence of 
colistin-resistant E. coli strains.

In Salmonella enterica, PmrD is a connector protein that links the two-component 
systems PhoP-PhoQ and PmrA-PmrB. While Escherichia coli encodes a PmrD homolog, 
it is thought to be incapable of connecting PhoPQ and PmrAB in this organism due 
to functional divergence from the S. enterica protein. However, our laboratory 
previously observed that low concentrations of Mg(2+), a PhoPQ-activating 
signal, leads to the induction of PmrAB-dependent lipid A modifications in 
wild-type E. coli (C. M. Herrera, J. V. Hankins, and M. S. Trent, Mol Microbiol 
76:1444-1460, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07150.x). These 
modifications include phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) and 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose 
(l-Ara4N), which promote bacterial resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides 
(CAMPs) when affixed to lipid A. Here, we demonstrate that pmrD is required for 
modification of the lipid A domain of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) under 
low-Mg(2+) growth conditions. Further, RNA sequencing shows that E. coli pmrD 
influences the expression of pmrA and its downstream targets, including genes 
coding for the modification enzymes that transfer pEtN and l-Ara4N to the lipid 
A molecule. In line with these findings, a pmrD mutant is dramatically impaired 
in survival compared with the wild-type strain when exposed to the CAMP 
polymyxin B. Notably, we also reveal the presence of an unknown factor or system 
capable of activating pmrD to promote lipid A modification in the absence of the 
PhoPQ system. These results illuminate a more complex network of protein 
interactions surrounding activation of PhoPQ and PmrAB in E. coli than 
previously understood.

BACKGROUND: Polymyxin B resistance protein D (PmrD) plays a key role in the 
polymyxin B-resistance pathway, as it is the signaling protein that can act as a 
specific connecter between PmrA/PmrB and PhoP/PhoQ. We conducted structural 
analysis to characterize Escherichia coli (E. coli) PmrD, which exhibits 
different features compared with PmrD in other bacteria.
RESULTS: The X-ray crystal structure of E. coli PmrD was determined at a 2.00 Å 
resolution, revealing novel information such as the unambiguous secondary 
structures of the protein and the presence of a disulfide bond. Furthermore, 
various assays such as native gel electrophoresis, surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR), size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and 
small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, were performed to elucidate 
the structural and functional role of the internal disulfide bond in E. coli 
PmrD.
CONCLUSIONS: The structural characteristics of E. coli PmrD were clearly 
identified via diverse techniques. The findings help explain the different 
protective mechanism of E. coli compared to other Gram-negative bacteria.

Ancestral genes can control the ability of horizontally acquired loci to confer 
new traits.

Horizontally acquired genes typically function as autonomous units conferring 
new abilities when introduced into different species. However, we reasoned that 
proteins preexisting in an organism might constrain the functionality of a 
horizontally acquired gene product if it operates on an ancestral pathway. Here, 
we determine how the horizontally acquired pmrD gene product activates the 
ancestral PmrA/PmrB two-component system in Salmonella enterica but not in the 
closely related bacterium Escherichia coli. The Salmonella PmrD protein binds to 
the phosphorylated PmrA protein (PmrA-P), protecting it from dephosphorylation 
by the PmrB protein. This results in transcription of PmrA-dependent genes, 
including those conferring polymyxin B resistance. We now report that the E. 
coli PmrD protein can activate the PmrA/PmrB system in Salmonella even though it 
cannot do it in E. coli, suggesting that these two species differ in an 
additional component controlling PmrA-P levels. We establish that the E. coli 
PmrB displays higher phosphatase activity towards PmrA-P than the Salmonella 
PmrB, and we identified a PmrB subdomain responsible for this property. 
Replacement of the E. coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog was sufficient 
to render E. coli resistant to polymyxin B under PmrD-inducing conditions. Our 
findings provide a singular example whereby quantitative differences in the 
biochemical activities of orthologous ancestral proteins dictate the ability of 
a horizontally acquired gene product to confer species-specific traits. And they 
suggest that horizontally acquired genes can potentiate selection at ancestral 
loci.

Resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B from Gram-negative 
bacteria is accomplished by two-component systems (TCSs), protein complexes 
PmrA/PmrB and PhoP/PhoQ. PmrD is the first protein identified to mediate the 
connectivity between two TCSs. The 3D structure of PmrD has been recently solved 
by NMR and its unique fold was revealed. Here, a molecular dynamics study is 
presented started from the NMR structure. Numerous hydrophobic and electrostatic 
interactions were identified to contribute to PmrD's 3D stability. Moreover, the 
mobility of the five loops that connect the protein's six beta-strands has been 
explored. Solvent-accessible surface area calculation revealed that a 
Leucine-rich hydrophobic cluster of the protein stabilized the protein's 
structure.

PmrA/PmrB and PhoP/PhoQ are a pair of two-component systems (TCSs) that allow 
the Gram-negative bacteria to survive the cationic antimicrobial peptide 
polymyxin B. The two TCSs are linked by the polymyxin resistance protein, PmrD. 
The PhoP-activated PmrD protects the phosphorylated response regulator PmrA from 
dephosphorylation, and promotes the transcription of PmrA-activated genes 
responsible for polymyxin resistance. PmrD is the first protein identified to 
mediate the connectivity between two TCSs by protecting the phosphorylated 
response regulator of the downstream TCS. PmrD shows no homology to proteins 
with known structures. We present here the solution structure of PmrD from 
Escherichia coli, the first three-dimensional structure of the PmrD family. Our 
study provides the structural basis of the novel interacting mechanism of 
bacterial two-component signal-transduction systems.

A novel mechanism for connecting bacterial two-component signal-transduction 
systems.

Kinki University, 3327-204 Nakamachi, Nara 631-8505, Japan.

Bacteria have many two-component signal-transduction systems (TCSs) that respond 
to specific environmental signals by altering the phosphorylated state of a 
response regulator. Although these systems are presumed to form an intricate 
signal network, the detailed mechanism of how they interact with each other 
remains largely unexplained. In a recent study of Salmonella, two TCSs have been 
discovered to be connected by a protein that protects a response regulator from 
dephosphorylation promoted by its cognate sensor kinase. This novel mechanism 
might provide an answer to some of the linkages found between other TCSs.

Synthesis of the 31-amino acid, inner membrane protein MgtS (formerly denoted 
YneM) is induced by very low Mg2+ in a PhoPQ-dependent manner in Escherichia 
coli Here we report that MgtS acts to increase intracellular Mg2+ levels and 
maintain cell integrity upon Mg2+ depletion. Upon development of a functional 
tagged derivative of MgtS, we found that MgtS interacts with MgtA to increase 
the levels of this P-type ATPase Mg2+ transporter under Mg2+-limiting 
conditions. Correspondingly, the effects of MgtS upon Mg2+ limitation are lost 
in a ∆mgtA mutant, and MgtA overexpression can suppress the ∆mgtS phenotype. 
MgtS stabilization of MgtA provides an additional layer of regulation of this 
tightly controlled Mg2+ transporter and adds to the list of small proteins that 
regulate inner membrane transporters.

Membrane organization is usually associated with the correct function of a 
number of cellular processes in eukaryotic cells as diverse as signal 
transduction, protein sorting, membrane trafficking, or pathogen invasion. It 
has been recently discovered that bacterial membranes are able to 
compartmentalize their signal transduction pathways in functional membrane 
microdomains (FMMs). In this review article, we discuss the biological 
significance of the existence of FMMs in bacteria and comment on possible 
beneficial roles that FMMs play on the harbored signal transduction cascades. 
Moreover, four different membrane-associated signal transduction cascades whose 
functions are linked to the integrity of FMMs are introduced, and the specific 
role that FMMs play in stabilizing and promoting interactions of their signaling 
components is discussed. Altogether, FMMs seem to play a relevant role in 
promoting more efficient activation of signal transduction cascades in bacterial 
cells and show that bacteria are more sophisticated organisms than previously 
appreciated.

BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi is a human-restricted 
intracellular pathogen and the cause of typhoid fever. Cellular immune responses 
are required to control and clear Salmonella infection. Despite this, there are 
limited data on cellular immune responses in humans infected with wild type S. 
Typhi.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For this work, we used an automated approach to 
purify a subset of S. Typhi proteins identified in previous antibody-based 
immuno-affinity screens and antigens known to be expressed in vivo, including 
StaF-putative fimbrial protein-STY0202, StbB-fimbrial chaperone-STY0372, 
CsgF-involved in curli production-STY1177, CsgD- putative regulatory 
protein-STY1179, OppA-periplasmic oligopeptide binding protein 
precursor-STY1304, PagC-outer membrane invasion protein-STY1878, and conserved 
hypothetical protein-STY2195; we also generated and analyzed a crude membrane 
preparation of S. Typhi (MP). In comparison to samples collected from uninfected 
Bangladeshi and North American participants, we detected significant 
interferon-γ responses in PBMCs stimulated with MP, StaF, StbB, CsgF, CsgD, 
OppA, STY2195, and PagC in patients bacteremic with S. Typhi in Bangladesh. The 
majority of interferon-γ expressing T cells were CD4 cells, although CD8 
responses also occurred. We also assessed cellular proliferation responses in 
bacteremic patients, and confirmed increased responses in infected individuals 
to MP, StaF, STY2195, and PagC in convalescent compared to acute phase samples 
and compared to controls. StaF is a fimbrial protein homologous to E. coli YadK, 
and contains a Pfam motif thought to be involved in cellular adhesion. PagC is 
expressed in vivo under the control of the virulence-associated PhoP-regulon 
required for intra-macrophage survival of Salmonella. STY2195 is a conserved 
hypothetical protein of unknown function.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first analysis of cellular immune responses 
to purified S. Typhi antigens in patients with typhoid fever. These results 
indicate that patients generate significant CD4 and CD8 interferon-γ responses 
to specific S. Typhi antigens during typhoid fever, and that these responses are 
elevated at the time of clinical presentation. These observations suggest that 
an interferon-γ based detection system could be used to diagnose individuals 
with typhoid fever during the acute stage of illness.

Transcriptional analysis of a constitutively active mutant of the EvgA/EvgS 
two-component system of Escherichia coli resulted in enhanced expression of 13 
PhoP/PhoQ-regulated genes, crcA, hemL, mgtA, ompT, phoP, phoQ, proP, rstA, rstB, 
slyB, ybjG, yrbL, and mgrB. This regulatory network between the two systems also 
occurred as a result of overproduction of the EvgA regulator; however, enhanced 
transcription of the phoPQ genes did not further activate expression of the 
PhoP/PhoQ-regulated genes. These results demonstrated signal transduction from 
the EvgA/EvgS system to the PhoP/PhoQ system in E. coli and also identified the 
genes that required the two systems for enhanced expression. This is one example 
of the intricate signal transduction networks that are posited to exist in E. 
coli.

Recent studies revealed that acetylation is a widely used protein modification 
in prokaryotic organisms. The major protein acetylation acetyltransferase YfiQ 
and the sirtuin-like deacetylase CobB have been found to be involved in basic 
physiological processes, such as primary metabolism, chemotaxis, and stress 
responses, in Escherichia coli and Salmonella However, little is known about 
protein acetylation modifications in Yersinia pestis, a lethal pathogen 
responsible for millions of human deaths in three worldwide pandemics. Here we 
found that Yp_0659 and Yp_1760 of Y. pestis encode the major protein acetylation 
acetyltransferase YfiQ and the sirtuin-like deacetylase CobB, respectively, 
which can acetylate and deacetylate PhoP enzymatically in vitro Protein 
acetylation impairment in cobB and yfiQ mutants greatly decreased bacterial 
tolerance to cold, hot, high-salt, and acidic environments. Our comparative 
transcriptomic data revealed that the strongly decreased tolerance to stress 
stimuli was probably related to downregulation of the genes encoding the heat 
shock proteins (HtpG, HslV, HslR, and IbpA), cold shock proteins (CspC and 
CspA1), and acid resistance proteins (HdeB and AdiA). We found that the 
reversible acetylation mediated by CobB and YfiQ conferred attenuation of 
virulence, probably partially due to the decreased expression of the psaABCDEF 
operon, which encodes Psa fimbriae that play a key role in virulence of Y. 
pestis This is the first report, to our knowledge, on the roles of protein 
acetylation modification in stress responses, biofilm formation, and virulence 
of Y. pestis.

ω-Hydroxy palmitic acid (ω-HPA) is a valuable compound for an ingredient of 
artificially synthesized ceramides and an additive for lubricants and adhesives. 
Production of such a fatty acid derivative is limited by chemical catalysis, but 
plausible by biocatalysis. However, its low productivity issue, including 
formations of unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) byproducts in host cells, remains as 
a hurdle toward industrial biological processes. In this study, to achieve 
selective and high-level production of ω-HPA from glucose in Escherichia coli, 
FadR, a native transcriptional regulator of fatty acid metabolism, and its 
regulon were engineered. First, FadR was co-expressed with a thioesterase with a 
specificity toward palmitic acid production to enhance palmitic acid production 
yield, but a considerable quantity of UFAs was also produced. In order to avoid 
the UFA production caused by fadR overexpression, FadR regulon was rewired by i) 
mutating FadR consensus binding sites of fabA or fabB, ii) integrating fabZ into 
fabI operon, and iii) enhancing the strength of fabI promoter. This approach led 
to dramatic increases in both proportion (48.3-83.0%) and titer (377.8 mg/L to 
675.8 mg/L) of palmitic acid, mainly due to the decrease in UFA synthesis. 
Introducing a fatty acid ω-hydroxylase, CYP153A35, into the engineered strain 
resulted in a highly selective production of ω-HPA (83.5 mg/L) accounting for 
87.5% of total ω-hydroxy fatty acids. Furthermore, strategies, such as i) 
enhancement in CYP153A35 activity, ii) expression of a fatty acid transporter, 
iii) supplementation of triton X-100, and iv) separation of the ω-HPA synthetic 
pathway into two strains for a co-culture system, were applied and resulted in 
401.0 mg/L of ω-HPA production. For such selective productions of palmitic acid 
and ω-HPA, the rewiring of FadR regulation in E. coli is a promising strategy to 
develop an industrial process with economical downstream processing.

Escherichia coli strain SM101 harbors a temperature-sensitive allele (lpxA2) of 
the gene encoding UDP-Glc-NAc acyltransferase (the first enzyme of the lipid A 
pathway). SM101 is temperature-sensitive for lipid A biosynthesis and growth. To 
determine whether or not E. coli mutants lacking lipid A can be isolated, we 
examined temperature-resistant revertants of SM101. All regained the ability to 
synthesize lipid A. However, some were not true revertants but had acquired 
mutations in a neighboring gene (orf17), while retaining the original lpxA2 
lesion. Cell extracts of such revertants displayed 2-5 fold reductions in the 
specific activity of (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP dehydrase. Wild-type cells that 
overproduced the protein encoded by orf17 overproduced (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP 
dehydrase activity as much as 170-fold, suggesting that orf17 is the structural 
gene for the dehydrase. The proposed function of orf17 is further supported by 
its sequence similarity to fabA, the structural gene for (3R)-hydroxydecanoyl 
dehydrase of E. coli. We suggest that bypass of the lpxA2 phenotype by mutations 
in orf17 may be due to an increased (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP pool. The orf17 
gene (which we now designate fabZ) is not regulated by fadR. However, orf17 may 
be related to sefA, a suppressor of certain lesions in the cell division/lipid A 
biosynthesis gene, envA.

Two-component systems (TCS) and small RNAs (sRNA) are widespread regulators that 
participate in the response and the adaptation of bacteria to their 
environments. TCSs and sRNAs mostly act at the transcriptional and 
post-transcriptional levels, respectively, and can be found integrated in 
regulatory circuits, where TCSs control sRNAs transcription and/or sRNAs 
post-transcriptionally regulate TCSs synthesis. In response to nitrate and 
nitrite, the paralogous NarQ-NarP and NarX-NarL TCSs regulate the expression of 
genes involved in anaerobic respiration of these alternative electron acceptors 
to oxygen. In addition to the previously reported repression of NarP synthesis 
by the SdsN137 sRNA, we show here that RprA, another Hfq-dependent sRNA, also 
negatively controls narP. Interestingly, the repression of narP by RprA actually 
relies on two independent mechanisms of control. The first is via the direct 
pairing of the central region of RprA to the narP translation initiation region 
and presumably occurs at the translation initiation level. In contrast, the 
second requires only the very 5' end of the narP mRNA, which is targeted, most 
likely indirectly, by the full-length or the shorter, processed, form of RprA. 
In addition, our results raise the possibility of a direct role of Hfq in narP 
control, further illustrating the diversity of post-transcriptional regulation 
mechanisms in the synthesis of TCSs.

Gutenberg-University Mainz, Mainz, 55099, Germany.

Many bacteria are able to use O2 and nitrate as alternative electron acceptors 
for respiration. Strategies for regulation in response to O2 and nitrate can 
vary considerably. In the paradigmatic system of E. coli (and γ-proteobacteria), 
regulation by O2 and nitrate is established by the O2 -sensor FNR and the 
two-component system NarX-NarL (for nitrate regulation). Expression of narGHJI 
is regulated by the binding of FNR and NarL to the promoter. A similar strategy 
by individual regulation in response to O2 and nitrate is verified in many 
genera by the use of various types of regulators. Otherwise, in the soil 
bacteria Bacillus subtilis (Firmicutes) and Streptomyces (Actinobacteria), 
nitrate respiration is subject to anaerobic induction, without direct nitrate 
induction. In contrast, the NreA-NreB-NreC two-component system of 
Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) performs joint sensing of O2 and nitrate by 
interacting O2 and nitrate sensors. The O2 -sensor NreB phosphorylates the 
response regulator NreC to activate narGHJI expression. NreC-P transmits the 
signal for anaerobiosis to the promoter. The nitrate sensor NreA modulates NreB 
function by converting NreB in the absence of nitrate from the kinase to a 
phosphatase that dephosphorylates NreC-P. Thus, widely different strategies for 
coordinating the response to O2 and nitrate have evolved in bacteria.

Microbes reprogrammed using advanced genetic circuits are envisaged as emerging 
living diagnostics for a wide range of diseases and play key roles in regulating 
gut microbiota to treat disease-associated symptoms in a non-invasive manner. 
Here, we developed a designer probiotic Escherichia coli that senses and 
responds to nitrate, a biomarker of gut inflammation. To this end, we first 
employed the NarX-NarL two-component regulatory system in E. coli to construct a 
nitrate-responsive genetic circuit. Next, we optimized the nitrate biosensor for 
the best performance using measures of sensitivity and specificity. We then 
introduced this genetic circuit into a probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. We 
demonstrated that the designed biosensor can sense elevated nitrate levels 
during gut inflammation in mice with native gut microbiota. Moreover, using 
Boolean AND gate, we generated a genetically encoded biosensor for simultaneous 
sensing of the thiosulfate and nitrate biomarkers, thus increasing the tool's 
specificity for diagnosing gut inflammation. The nitrate-responsive genetic 
circuit will enable new approaches for non-invasive diagnostics of 
inflammation-associated diseases.

The Escherichia coli NarX/NarL two-component response-regulator system regulates 
gene expression in response to nitrate ions and the NarL protein is a global 
transcription factor, which activates transcript initiation at many target 
promoters. One such target, the E. coli ogt promoter, which controls the 
expression of an O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase, is dependent on NarL 
binding to two DNA targets centred at positions -44.5 and -77.5 upstream from 
the transcript start. Here, we describe ogt promoter derivatives that can be 
activated solely by NarL binding either at position -44.5 or position -77.5. We 
show that NarL can also activate the ogt promoter when located at position 
-67.5. We present data to argue that NarL-dependent activation of transcript 
initiation at the ogt promoter results from a direct interaction between NarL 
and a determinant in the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit. 
Footprinting experiments show that, at the -44.5 promoter, NarL and the 
C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit bind to opposite faces of 
promoter DNA, suggesting an unusual mechanism of transcription activation. Our 
work suggests new organisations for activator-dependent transcription at 
promoters and future applications for biotechnology.

Augmenting live cells with new signal transduction capabilities is a key 
objective in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. We showed earlier that 
two-component signaling pathways could function in mammalian cells, albeit while 
losing their ligand sensitivity. Here, we show how to transduce small-molecule 
ligands in a dose-dependent fashion into gene expression in mammalian cells 
using two-component signaling machinery. First, we engineer mutually 
complementing truncated mutants of a histidine kinase unable to dimerize and 
phosphorylate the response regulator. Next, we fuse these mutants to protein 
domains capable of ligand-induced dimerization, which restores the phosphoryl 
transfer in a ligand-dependent manner. Cytoplasmic ligands are transduced by 
facilitating mutant dimerization in the cytoplasm, while extracellular ligands 
trigger dimerization at the inner side of a plasma membrane. These findings 
point to the potential of two-component regulatory systems as enabling tools for 
orthogonal signaling pathways in mammalian cells.

Bacteria live in environments with dynamic changes. To sense and respond to 
different external stimuli, bacteria make use of various sensor-response 
circuits, called two-component systems (TCSs). A TCS comprises a histidine 
protein kinase (HK) sensing environmental stimuli and a response regulator 
protein (RR) regulating downstream genes. The two components are coupled via a 
phosphorylation control mechanism. In a recent study, we adopted an optogenetics 
approach to re-engineer the sensor HKs in Escherichia coli as a light-sensing 
fusion protein. We constructed a light-controllable HK by replacing the original 
signal-specific sensing domain of HK with the light-sensing domain of Cph1 from 
Cyanobacteria Synechocystis, so that HK can be investigated by red light. Here, 
we extended the study to other 16 HK-RR TCSs and constructed a library of 
light-responsible HK-Cph1 chimeras. By taking the NarX-NarL system as an 
example, we demonstrated the light responsiveness of the constructed chimera and 
investigated the frequency response of the NarXNarL system. The constructed 
library serves as a toolkit for future TCS study using optogenetics approach.

In two-component signal transduction, a sensor protein transmitter module 
controls cognate receiver domain phosphorylation. Most receiver domain sequences 
contain a small residue (Gly or Ala) at position T + 1 just distal to the 
essential Thr or Ser residue that forms part of the active site. However, some 
members of the NarL receiver subfamily have a large hydrophobic residue at 
position T + 1. Our laboratory previously isolated a NarL mutant in which the T 
+ 1 residue Val-88 was replaced with an orthodox small Ala. This NarL V88A 
mutant confers a striking phenotype in which high-level target operon expression 
is both signal (nitrate) and sensor (NarX and NarQ) independent. This suggests 
that the NarL V88A protein is phosphorylated by cross talk from noncognate 
sources. Although cross talk was enhanced in ackA null strains that accumulate 
acetyl phosphate, it persisted in pta ackA double null strains that cannot 
synthesize this compound and was observed also in narL(+) strains. This 
indicates that acetate metabolism has complex roles in mediating NarL cross 
talk. Contrariwise, cross talk was sharply diminished in an arcB barA double 
null strain, suggesting that the encoded sensors contribute substantially to 
NarL V88A cross talk. Separately, the V88A substitution altered the in vitro 
rates of NarL autodephosphorylation and transmitter-stimulated dephosphorylation 
and decreased affinity for the cognate sensor, NarX. Together, these experiments 
show that the residue at position T + 1 can strongly influence two distinct 
aspects of receiver domain function, the autodephosphorylation rate and cross 
talk inhibition.
IMPORTANCE: Many bacterial species contain a dozen or more discrete 
sensor-response regulator two-component systems that convert a specific input 
into a distinct output pattern. Cross talk, the unwanted transfer of signals 
between circuits, occurs when a response regulator is phosphorylated 
inappropriately from a noncognate source. Cross talk is inhibited in part by the 
high interaction specificity between cognate sensor-response regulator pairs. 
This study shows that a relatively subtle missense change from Val to Ala 
nullifies cross talk inhibition, enabling at least two noncognate sensors to 
enforce an inappropriate output independently of the relevant input.

Two-component signal transduction involves phosphoryl transfer between a 
histidine kinase sensor and a response regulator effector. The 
nitrate-responsive two-component signal transduction systems in Escherichia coli 
represent a paradigm for a cross-regulation network, in which the paralogous 
sensor-response regulator pairs, NarX-NarL and NarQ-NarP, exhibit both cognate 
(e.g. NarX-NarL) and non-cognate (e.g. NarQ-NarL) interactions to control 
output. Here, we describe results from bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid 
(BACTH) analysis to examine sensor dimerization as well as interaction between 
sensor-response regulator cognate and non-cognate pairs. Although results from 
BACTH analysis indicated that the NarX and NarQ sensors interact with each 
other, results from intragenic complementation tests demonstrate that they do 
not form functional heterodimers. Additionally, intragenic complementation shows 
that both NarX and NarQ undergo intermolecular autophosphorylation, deviating 
from the previously reported correlation between DHp (dimerization and histidyl 
phosphotransfer) domain loop handedness and autophosphorylation mode. Results 
from BACTH analysis revealed robust interactions for the NarX-NarL, NarQ-NarL 
and NarQ-NarP pairs but a much weaker interaction for the NarX-NarP pair. This 
demonstrates that asymmetrical cross-regulation results from differential 
binding affinities between different sensor-regulator pairs. Finally, results 
indicate that the NarL effector (DNA-binding) domain inhibits NarX-NarL 
interaction. Missense substitutions at receiver domain residue Ser-80 enhanced 
NarX-NarL interaction, apparently by destabilizing the NarL receiver-effector 
domain interface.

A Crp-dependent two-component system regulates nitrate and nitrite respiration 
in Shewanella oneidensis.

We have previously illustrated the nitrate/nitrite respiratory pathway of 
Shewanella oneidensis, which is renowned for its remarkable versatility in 
respiration. Here we investigated the systems regulating the pathway with a 
reliable approach which enables characterization of mutants impaired in 
nitrate/nitrite respiration by guaranteeing biomass. The S. oneidensis genome 
encodes an Escherichia coli NarQ/NarX homolog SO3981 and two E. coli NarP/NarL 
homologs SO1860 and SO3982. Results of physiological characterization and 
mutational analyses demonstrated that S. oneidensis possesses a single 
two-component system (TCS) for regulation of nitrate/nitrite respiration, 
consisting of the sensor kinase SO3981(NarQ) and the response regulator 
SO3982(NarP). The TCS directly controls the transcription of nap and nrfA (genes 
encoding nitrate and nitrite reductases, respectively) but regulates the former 
less tightly than the latter. Additionally, phosphorylation at residue 57 of 
SO3982 is essential for its DNA-binding capacity. At the global control level, 
Crp is found to regulate expression of narQP as well as nap and nrfA. In 
contrast to NarP-NarQ, Crp is more essential for nap rather than nrfA.

Legless pathogens: how bacterial physiology provides the key to understanding 
pathogenicity.

Cole JA(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.

This review argues that knowledge of microbial physiology and metabolism is a 
prerequisite to understanding mechanisms of pathogenicity. The ability of 
Neisseria gonorrhoeae to cope with stresses such as those found during infection 
requires a sialyltransferase to sialylate its lipopolysaccharide using 
host-derived CMP-NANA in the human bloodstream, the ability to oxidize lactate 
that is abundant in the human body, outer-membrane lipoproteins that provide the 
first line of protection against oxidative and nitrosative stress, regulation of 
NO reduction independently from the nitrite reductase that forms NO, an extra 
haem group on the C-terminal extension of a cytochrome oxidase subunit, and a 
respiratory capacity far in excess of metabolic requirements. These properties 
are all normal components of neisserial physiology; they would all fail rigid 
definitions of a pathogenicity determinant. In anaerobic cultures of enteric 
bacteria, duplicate pathways for nitrate reduction to ammonia provide a 
selective advantage when nitrate is either abundant or scarce. Selection of 
these alternative pathways is in part regulated by two parallel two-component 
regulatory systems. NarX-NarL primarily ensures that nitrate is reduced in 
preference to thermodynamically less favourable terminal electron acceptors, but 
NarQ-NarP facilitates reduction of limited quantities of nitrate or other, less 
favourable, terminal electron acceptors in preference to fermentative growth. 
How enteric bacteria repair damage caused by nitrosative and oxidative damage 
inflicted by host defences is less well understood. In both N. gonorrhoeae and 
Escherichia coli, parallel pathways that duplicate particular biochemical 
functions are far from redundant, but fulfil specific physiological roles.

OBJECTIVES: In Escherichia coli, there are 32 open reading frames assumed, on 
the basis of sequence similarities, to be response regulator genes of 
two-component signal transduction systems. We cloned all 32 response regulators 
and examined whether or not response regulator-overexpressing cells confer 
resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in E. coli.
METHODS: E. coli KAM3 (acrB), a drug-hypersusceptible mutant, was used as a host 
strain for the overproduction of response regulators. MICs were determined by 
the agar dilution method.
RESULTS: Thirteen response regulators out of 32 genes, namely baeR, cheY, cpxR, 
creB, evgA, fimZ, narL, ompR, rcsB, rstA, yedW, yehT and dcuR, conferred 
increased beta-lactam resistance. Among them, overexpression of baeR, evgA, rcsB 
and dcuR conferred high-level resistance. The baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance 
is due to up-regulation of the expression of multidrug exporter genes, acrD and 
mdtABC for baeR, and yhiUV for evgA, because baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance 
was completely absent in strains lacking these exporter genes. The fimZ-mediated 
cefalothin resistance is due to the chromosomal ampC gene, because the ampC 
deletion strain did not show fimZ-mediated resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-component signal transduction systems contribute to beta-lactam 
resistance in E. coli. Multidrug exporters play roles in two-component signal 
transduction system-mediated beta-lactam resistance.

An iTRAQ-based comparative and quantitative proteomics analysis of a soil-borne 
Mn(II)-oxidizing bacterium, Escherichia coli MB266, was conducted during the 
exponential and stationary growth phases. A total of 1850 proteins were 
identified in 4 samples, of which 373 and 456 proteins were significantly up- or 
down-regulated in at least one pairwise comparison, respectively. The iTRAQ data 
indicated that several enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism (i.e., FabA, 
FabD and FabZ) and pyruvate metabolism (particularly pyruvate oxidase PoxB) were 
significantly up-regulated, while those related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle 
(such as FrdB, FumB and AcnA) and methylcitrate cycle (i.e., PrpC) were 
inactivated in the presence of 1 mM Mn(II); the amounts of some stress response 
and signal transduction system-related proteins (i.e., Spy) were remarkably 
increased, and the cold shock protein CspD was significantly up-regulated during 
the exponential growth phase. However, all verified heat shock proteins remained 
unchanged. The reactive oxygen species response and some redox enzymes might 
also be involved in Mn oxidation processes. The involvement of several cellular 
proteins in Mn(II) oxidation, including PoxB, Spy and MCO266, was further 
confirmed by gene disruption and expression complementation experiments. Based 
on these results, a signal transduction mechanism coupled to Mn oxidation was 
proposed.

AcnC of Escherichia coli is a 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (PrpD) that can use

Escherichia coli possesses two well-characterized aconitases (AcnA and AcnB) and 
a minor activity (designated AcnC) that is retained by acnAB double mutants and 
represents no more than 5% of total wild-type aconitase activity. Here it is 
shown that a 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (PrpD) encoded by the prpD gene of the 
propionate catabolic operon (prpRBCDE) is identical to AcnC. Inactivation of 
prpD abolished the residual aconitase activity of an AcnAB-null strain, whereas 
inactivation of ybhJ, an unidentified acnA paralogue, had no significant effect 
on AcnC activity. Purified PrpD catalysed the dehydration of citrate and 
isocitrate but was most active with 2-methylcitrate. PrpD also catalysed the 
dehydration of several other hydroxy acids but failed to hydrate cis-aconitate 
and related substrates containing double bonds, indicating that PrpD is not a 
typical aconitase but a dehydratase. Purified PrpD was shown to be a monomeric 
iron-sulphur protein (M(r) 54000) having one unstable [2Fe-2S] cluster per 
monomer, which is needed for maximum catalytic activity and can be reconstituted 
by treatment with Fe(2+) under reducing conditions.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD)-deficient Escherichia coli was cultivated under the 
oxidative stress generated by photoexcited titanium dioxide. These cells showed 
higher growth rate and glucose consumption rate with accelerated accumulation of 
acetic acid in the medium, compared to the cells cultivated under the normal 
condition without the stress. Under the stress condition, the activity of 
acetate kinase and mRNA expressions of the enzymes for acetic acid production 
(pta and ackA) were approximately doubled, while the activity of citrate 
synthase and mRNA expressions of the enzymes in TCA cycle (gltA, acnA, icd, 
sucA, sucC, sdhA, fumA and mdh) were repressed by about half, as compared with 
those under the normal condition. These results suggest that the 
stress-suffering cells switch the metabolic pathway into a "suppressed 
aerobiosis", possibly for lowering the generation of reactive oxygen species.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD)-deficient Escherichia coli was cultivated under the 
oxidative stress generated by photoexcited titanium dioxide. These cells showed 
higher growth rate and glucose consumption rate with accelerated accumulation of 
acetic acid in the medium, compared to the cells cultivated under the normal 
condition without the stress. Under the stress condition, the activity of 
acetate kinase and mRNA expressions of the enzymes for acetic acid production 
(pta and ackA) were approximately doubled, while the activity of citrate 
synthase and mRNA expressions of the enzymes in TCA cycle (gltA, acnA, icd, 
sucA, sucC, sdhA, fumA and mdh) were repressed by about half, as compared with 
those under the normal condition. These results suggest that the 
stress-suffering cells switch the metabolic pathway into a "suppressed 
aerobiosis", possibly for lowering the generation of reactive oxygen species.

The ArcB/ArcA two-component signal transduction system of Escherichia coli 
regulates gene expression in response to the redox conditions of growth. Over 
the years, genetic screens have lead to the identification of about 30 
ArcA-P-controlled operons that are involved in redox metabolism. However, the 
discovery of 3 targets that are not implicated in respiratory metabolism (the 
tra operon for plasmid conjugation, psi site for Xer-based recombination, and 
oriC site for chromosome replication) suggests that the Arc modulon may comprise 
additional operons that are involved in a myriad of functions. To identify these 
operons, we derived the ArcA-P-dependent transcription profile of E. coli using 
oligonucleotide-based microarray analysis. The findings indicated that 9% of all 
open reading frames in E. coli are affected either directly or indirectly by 
ArcA-P. To identify which operons are under the direct control of ArcA-P, we 
developed the ArcA-P recognition weight matrix from footprinting data and used 
it to scan the genome, yielding an ArcA-P sequence affinity map. By overlaying 
both methods, we identified 55 new Arc-regulated operons that are implicated in 
energy metabolism, transport, survival, catabolism, and transcriptional 
regulation. The data also suggest that the Arc response pathway, which 
translates into a net global downscaling of gene expression, overlaps partly 
with the FNR regulatory network. A conservative but reasonable assessment is 
that the Arc pathway recruits 100-150 operons to mediate a role in cellular 
adaptation that is more extensive than hitherto anticipated.

Characterization of a group of anaerobically induced, fnr-dependent genes of 
Salmonella typhimurium.

We have previously reported the isolation of a group of anaerobically regulated, 
fnr-dependent lac fusions in Salmonella typhimurium and have grouped these oxd 
genes into classes based on map position. In order to identify these genes, we 
have replaced the original Mud-lac fusion in a member of each oxd class with the 
much smaller Mud-cam element, cloned the fusion, and determined DNA sequence 
sufficient to define the oxd gene. Several of the fusions correspond to 
previously known genes from S. typhimurium or Escherichia coli: oxd-4 = cbiA and 
oxd-11 = cbiK, oxd-5 = hybB, oxd-7 = dcuB, oxd-8 = moaB, oxd-12 = dmsA, and 
oxd-14 = napB (aeg-46. 5). Two other fusions correspond to previously unknown 
loci: oxd-2 encodes an acetate/propionate kinase, and oxd-6 encodes a putative 
ABC transporter present in S. typhimurium but not in E. coli.

Cleavage of chromosomal DNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO by Spel and Dpnl has 
been used together with PFGE and Southern hybridization to establish the map 
location of the following principal denitrification genes: narGH (encoding the 
large and small subunits of respiratory nitrate reductase), nirS (cytochrome-cd1 
nitrite reductase), nirE (uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase for haem d1 
biosynthesis), norCB (nitric-oxide reductase complex), nosZ (nitrous-oxide 
reductase) and nosA (an outer-membrane protein and OprC homologue). The study 
also included several genes related to anaerobic or microaerophilic metabolism: 
napA (encoding the catalytic subunit of the periplasmic nitrate reductase), ccoN 
(catalytic subunit of the cytochrome-cbb3 oxidase), hemN (oxygen-independent 
coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase), an fnr-like regulatory gene, and azu and fdxA 
(electron carriers azurin and ferredoxin, respectively). Genes necessary for 
denitrification are concentrated at 20 to 36 min on the P. aeruginosa 
chromosome, where they form three separate loci, the nir-nor, nar and nos gene 
clusters. Genomic DNA of Pseudomonas stutzeri ZoBell was also subjected to Spel 
restriction and Southern analysis to assign denitrification genes to individual 
fragments. A homologue of nosA encoding a putative component of the 
Cu-processing apparatus for nitrous-oxide reductase was identified. In both P. 
aeruginosa and P. stutzeri there is evidence for the linkage of anr (fnrA) with 
hemN and ccoN; and for the presence of a napA gene.

A geographically widespread plasmid from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans has genes for

During a search for genes encoding electron transport proteins from a 
Thiobacillus ferroxidans ATCC 33020 gene bank, a 19.8 kb plasmid, pTF5, which 
conferred increased sensitivity to the antimicrobial agent metronidazole upon an 
Escherichia coli mutant, was isolated and cloned in E. coli. The plasmid had an 
identical restriction enzyme map to a plasmid which has been found in T. 
ferrooxidans strains isolated from many different parts of the world. The 
plasmid was present at between two and four copies per genome and contained a 
region of approximately 5-6 kb which was also found on the chromosome. This 
region was sequenced and found to have four complete ORFs, which when translated 
had high percentage amino acid similarity to [3Fe-4S,4Fe-4S] ferredoxins, 
proteins of the FNR regulator family, prismane-like proteins and the NADH 
oxidoreductase subunit of a methane monooxygenase. In vitro protein analysis 
using an E. coli-derived transcription-translation system indicated that three 
of the four products (FdxA, PsmA and RedA) were expressed in the heterologous 
system. Ferredoxins, prismane-like proteins and NADH oxidoreductases are 
redox-active proteins and it is likely that the proteins on pTF5 represent an 
electron transport system of as yet unknown function. Surprisingly, although 
genes for redox-active proteins have been isolated from other bacteria by 
screening gene banks for increased sensitivity to metronidazole, the region of 
pTF5 containing the genes for these proteins was not responsible for the 
increase in metronidazole sensitivity conferred by the plasmid. The region of 
pTF5 which did confer increased metronidazole sensitivity to an E. coli 
metronidazole-resistant mutant was a 319 bp region of DNA close to the origin of 
plasmid replication. This region contained no ORFs and was identical to that 
previously reported for the replicon of a 9.8 kb T. ferrooxidans plasmid, 
pTF191.

The expression of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) from Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 in 
heterocysts and vegetative cells has been quantified. Specific reductase 
activity in heterocysts was approximately 10 times higher than in vegetative 
cells, corresponding to the increased FNR protein content. This was confirmed by 
immunoquantification of the FNR protein from whole filaments of Anabaena sp. PCC 
7120 grown in media with and without combined nitrogen. Transcription of the 
petH gene was markedly enhanced in the absence of combined nitrogen. This 
suggests that the increased RNA level is mainly responsible for the 
up-regulation of FNR in heterocysts. As has been observed for nif genes, iron 
deficiency also increased transcription of petH. Characterization of the FNR 
purified from isolated heterocysts showed no detectable differences from the 
enzyme from vegetative cells. Although nitrogen stress was a key regulatory 
factor, localization of the petH gene in the genomic map of Anabaena PCC 7120 
showed that this gene is not physically associated with the nif cluster.

Escherichia coli K-12 genes essential for the synthesis of c-type cytochromes 
and a third nitrate reductase located in the periplasm.

Grove J(1), Tanapongpipat S, Thomas G, Griffiths L, Crooke H, Cole J.

Author information:
(1)School of Biochemistry, University of Birmingham, UK.

The 'aeg46.5' operon was originally detected as an 'anaerobically expressed 
gene' located at minute 46.5 on the Escherichia coli linkage map. Subsequent 
results from the E. coli Genome Sequencing Project revealed that the 'aeg46.5' 
promoter was located in the centisome 49 (minute 47) region. Downstream from 
this promoter are 15 genes, seven of which are predicted to encode a periplasmic 
nitrate reductase and eight encode proteins homologous to proteins essential for 
cytochrome c assembly in other bacteria. All of these genes, together with the 
'aeg46.5' promoter, have been subcloned on a 20kb EcoRI fragment from Kohara 
phage 19D1. Evidence is presented that, as predicted, the region includes 
structural genes for two c-type cytochromes of mass 16kDa and 24 kDa, which are 
transcribed from the previously described 'aeg46.5' promoter, and that the first 
seven genes encode a functional nitrate reductase. We, therefore, propose that 
they should be designated nap (nitrate reductase in the periplasm) genes. 
Plasmids encoding the entire 20kb region, or only the downstream eight genes, 
complemented five mutations resulting in total absence of all five known c-type 
cytochromes in E coli, providing biochemical evidence that these are ccm (for 
cytochrome c maturation) genes. The ccm region was transcribed both from the 
FNR-dependent, NarL- and NarP-regulated nap promoter (formerly the 'aeg46.5' 
promoter) and from constitutive or weakly regulated promoters apparently located 
within the downstream nap and ccm genes.

Nitrate and nitrite regulation of the Fnr-dependent aeg-46.5 promoter of 
Escherichia coli K-12 is mediated by competition between homologous response 
regulators (NarL and NarP) for a common DNA-binding site.

Darwin AJ(1), Stewart V.

The NarL and NarP proteins are homologous response regulators that function to 
regulate anaerobic respiratory gene expression in response to nitrate and 
nitrite in Escherichia coli. Expression of the aeg-46.5 operon (anaerobically 
expressed gene at 46.5 minutes on the genetic map) is induced during anaerobic 
growth by the global transcriptional regulatory protein Fnr. aeg-46.5 operon 
expression is further induced by the NarP protein in response to nitrate or 
nitrite and this induction is antagonized by NarL. We used in vivo and in vitro 
techniques to investigate how these three transcriptional regulatory proteins 
control the activity of a single promoter. Deletion and mutational analysis of 
the aeg-46.5 operon control region identified two distinct cis-acting elements. 
A sequence with similarity to the Fnr-binding site consensus, centered at 
position -64.5, was essential for Fnr-dependent anaerobic induction of aeg-46.5 
operon expression. In all other naturally occurring Fnr-dependent promoters the 
primary Fnr-binding site is centered between -40 and -50. The second cis-acting 
element, a region of perfect symmetry centered at -44.5, shares sequence 
similarity with the NarL-binding site consensus. This region was required for 
nitrate and nitrite induction of aeg-46.5 operon expression. We purified the 
NarP and NarL proteins as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins and 
investigated their interaction with the aeg-46.5 operon control region. 
Incubation with the phospho-donor, acetyl phosphate, allowed both MBP-NarP and 
MBP-NarL to protect the -44.5 region of the aeg-46.5 operon control region from 
DNase I cleavage. Single and double nucleotide substitutions in the -44.5 region 
reduced or abolished nitrate and nitrite induction of aeg-46.5 operon expression 
in vivo and prevented the binding of MBP-NarP and MBP-NarL to the control region 
in vitro. Presumably, the NarP and NarL proteins compete for the -44.5 binding 
site to regulate aeg-46.5 operon expression in response to nitrate and nitrite. 
Apparently, only the NarP protein is competent to activate transcription of the 
aeg-46.5 operon when bound to the -44.5 region.

Anaerobic activation of the entire denitrification pathway in Pseudomonas

The Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene anr, which encodes a structural and functional 
analog of the anaerobic regulator Fnr in Escherichia coli, was mapped to the 
SpeI fragment R, which is at about 59 min on the genomic map of P. aeruginosa 
PAO1. Wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 grew under anaerobic conditions with nitrate, 
nitrite, and nitrous oxide as alternative electron acceptors. An anr deletion 
mutant, PAO6261, was constructed. It was unable to grow with these alternative 
electron acceptors; however, its ability to denitrify was restored upon the 
introduction of the wild-type anr gene. In addition, the activities of two 
enzymes in the denitrification pathway, nitrite reductase and nitric oxide 
reductase, were not detectable under oxygen-limiting conditions in strain 
PAO6261 but were restored when complemented with the anr+ gene. These results 
indicate that the anr gene product plays a key role in anaerobically activating 
the entire denitrification pathway.

Transcriptional control of the nuo operon which encodes the energy-conserving 
NADH dehydrogenase of Salmonella typhimurium.

Archer CD(1), Elliott T.

Author information:
(1)Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35294, USA.

The 14 nuo genes encode the subunits of the type I (energy-conserving) NADH 
dehydrogenase, a key component of the respiratory chain. Salmonella typhimurium, 
like Escherichia coli, has two enzymes that can oxidize NADH and transfer 
electrons to ubiquinone, but only the type I enzyme translocates protons across 
the membrane to generate a proton motive force. Cells with the type I enzyme are 
energetically more efficient; the role of the type II enzyme (encoded by ndh) is 
not established, but it may function like a relief valve to allow more rapid 
NADH recycling. Here, we have investigated transcription of the nuo gene 
cluster, primarily in S. typhimurium. Studies with polar insertion mutants 
demonstrate that these genes are arranged as a single, large operon that is 
expressed from a complex promoter region upstream of nuoA. The DNA sequence of 
the promoter region was determined, and primer extension analysis of nuo 
transcripts was used to map four major RNA 5' ends to this region. A set of lac 
operon fusions to various DNA segments from the nuo promoter region was also 
constructed. Analysis of these fusions confirmed the presence of at least two 
nuo promoters. Mutations in the global regulatory genes arcA, oxrA (fnr), crp, 
cya, and katF were tested for effects on expression of the nuo operon. However, 
none of the mutations tested had a large effect on expression of type I NADH 
dehydrogenase.

Regulation and sequence of the structural gene for cytochrome c552 from 
Escherichia coli: not a hexahaem but a 50 kDa tetrahaem nitrite reductase.

The structural gene, nrfA, for cytochrome c552, which is the terminal reductase 
of the formate-dependent pathway for nitrite reduction to ammonia, has been 
located at co-ordinate 4366 on the physical map of the Escherichia coli 
chromosome. The DNA sequence of nrfA encodes a tetrahaem c-type cytochrome with 
a predicted M(r) for the unprocessed product of 53,788. Cleavage of the putative 
signal peptide at Ala-26 would result in a mature, periplasmic cytochrome of 
M(r) 50,580 rather than a larger hexahaem cytochrome, as has been widely 
reported previously. A cytochrome of this size was detected by staining 
SDS-polyacrylamide gels for covalently bound haem. This cytochrome was partially 
purified by anion exchange chromatography and confirmed to be cytochrome c552 by 
difference spectroscopy. Similar cytochromes were detected in five other E. coli 
strains including strain ST 249, which was used previously to purify and 
characterize the protein. A plasmid with an in-phase deletion within nrfA 
directed the synthesis of a truncated haemoprotein of the predicted mass. 
In-phase translational fusions to lacZ were used to locate the nrfA translation 
start, and the transcription start site was found by S1 mapping. Expression from 
the FNR-dependent nrfA promoter was almost totally repressed during aerobic 
growth, partially induced during anaerobic growth in the absence of nitrite or 
in the presence of nitrate, but fully induced only during anaerobic growth in 
the presence of nitrite. No nitrate repression was detected in a narL mutant, 
but nitrite induction was unaffected, indicating that the nitrite-sensing 
mechanism is independent of the NarL protein. Expression from the nrfA promoter 
was subject to glucose repression but regulation was independent of the CRP-cAMP 
complex.

FNR-mediated regulation of hyp expression in Escherichia coli.

Biology and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 
2TN, UK.

The hypA-E operon is involved in the maturation of all three NiFe hydrogenases 
in Escherichia coli. Two hyp promoters have been described; a sigma54-dependent 
promoter upstream of hypA, and a sigma70-dependent promoter (PhypA) within the 
hypA coding region. Here it is shown that the oxygen-responsive transcription 
factor FNR regulates PhypA under anaerobic conditions only. PhypA does not 
possess a canonical FNR recognition sequence, but two FNR half-sites are 
present. Studies using PHYPA::lacZ fusions carrying lesions in one or both FNR 
half-sites indicated that although some residual anaerobic activity was retained 
by the promoter containing only the downstream FNR half-site, both half-sites 
are required for maximal PhypA activity in vivo. In vitro gel retardation 
analysis suggested that the primary interaction occurs at the downstream FNR 
half-site. Possible explanations for these observations and the implications for 
other FNR-regulated promoters are discussed.

Molecular characterization of an operon (hyp) necessary for the activity of the 
three hydrogenase isoenzymes in Escherichia coli.

The 58/59 min region of the Escherichia coli chromosome contains two divergently 
oriented gene clusters coding for proteins with a function in hydrogenase 
formation. One cluster (the hyc operon), transcribed counterclockwise with 
respect to the E. coli chromosome, codes for gene products with a structural 
role in hydrogenase 3 formation (Böhm et al., 1990). The nucleotide sequence of 
the divergently transcribed operon (hyp) has been determined. It contains five 
genes, all of which are expressed in vivo in a T7 promoter/polymerase system, 
and the sizes of the synthesized products correspond with those predicted from 
the amino acid sequence. Complementation analysis of previously characterized 
mutants showed that the hypB, hypC and hypD genes have a function in the 
formation of all three hydrogenase isoenzymes, lesions in hypB being 
complemented by high nickel ion concentration in the medium. Prevention of 
hypBCDE gene expression led to an altered electrophoretic pattern of hydrogenase 
1 and 2 constituent subunits, indicating increased chemical or proteolytic 
subunits, Under fermentative growth conditions, operon expression was governed 
by an NtrA-dependent promoter lying upstream of hypA working together with an 
fnr gene product-dependent promoter which was localized within the hypA gene. 
The latter (operon-internal) promoter is responsible for hypBCDE transcription 
under non-fermentative conditions when the -24/-12 NtrA-dependent promoter 
upstream of hypA is silent.

Transcription activation in vitro by the Bradyrhizobium japonicum regulatory 
protein FixK2.

In Bradyrhizobium japonicum, the N2-fixing root nodule endosymbiont of soybean, 
a group of genes required for microaerobic, anaerobic, or symbiotic growth is 
controlled by FixK2, a key regulator that is part of the FixLJ-FixK2 cascade. 
FixK2 belongs to the family of cyclic AMP receptor protein/fumarate and nitrate 
reductase (CRP/FNR) transcription factors that recognize a palindromic DNA motif 
(CRP/FNR box) associated with the regulated promoters. Here, we report on a 
biochemical analysis of FixK2 and its transcription activation activity in 
vitro. FixK2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as a soluble 
N-terminally histidine-tagged protein. Gel filtration experiments revealed that 
increasing the protein concentration shifts the monomer-dimer equilibrium toward 
the dimer. Purified FixK2 productively interacted with the B. japonicum 
sigma80-RNA polymerase holoenzyme, but not with E. coli sigma70-RNA polymerase 
holoenzyme, to activate transcription from the B. japonicum fixNOQP, fixGHIS, 
and hemN2 promoters in vitro. Furthermore, FixK2 activated transcription from 
the E. coli FF(-41.5) model promoter, again only in concert with B. japonicum 
RNA polymerase. All of these promoters are so-called class II CRP/FNR-type 
promoters. We showed by specific mutagenesis that the FixK2 box at nucleotide 
position -40.5 in the hemN2 promoter, but not that at -78.5, is crucial for 
activation both in vivo and in vitro, which argues against recognition of a 
potential class III promoter. Given the lack of any evidence for the presence of 
a cofactor in purified FixK2, we surmise that FixK2 alone is sufficient to 
activate in vitro transcription to at least a basal level. This contrasts with 
all well-studied CRP/FNR-type proteins, which do require coregulators.

Pseudomonas stutzeri is a facultative anaerobic bacterium with the capability of 
denitrification. In searching for regulators that control the expression of this 
trait in response to oxygen withdrawal, we have found an unprecedented 
multiplicity of four genes encoding transcription factors of the FNR family. The 
fnrA gene encodes a genuine FNR-type regulator, which is expressed 
constitutively and controls the cytochrome cbb3-type terminal oxidase (the cco 
operon), cytochrome c peroxidase (the ccp gene) and the oxygen-independent 
coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (the hemN gene), in addition to its previously 
demonstrated role in arginine catabolism (the arc operon). The fnr homologues 
dnrD, dnrE and dnrS encode regulators of a new subgroup within the FNR family. 
Their main distinctive feature is the lack of cysteine residues for complexing 
the [4Fe-4S] centre of redox-active FNR-type regulators. However, they form a 
phylogenetic lineage separate from the FixK branch of FNR proteins, which also 
lack this cysteine signature. We have studied the expression of the dnr genes 
under aerobic, oxygen-limited and denitrifying conditions. DnrD is a key 
regulator of denitrification by selective activation of the genes for cytochrome 
cd1 nitrite reductase and NO reductase. The dnrD gene is part of the 30 kb 
region carrying denitrification genes of P. stutzeri. Transcription of dnrD was 
activated in O2-limited cells and particularly strongly in denitrifying cells, 
but was not under the control of FnrA. In response to denitrifying growth 
conditions, dnrD was transcribed as part of an operon together with genes 
downstream and upstream of dnrD. dnrS was found about 9 kb upstream of dnrD, 
next to the nrdD gene for anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase. The transcription 
of dnrS required FnrA in O2-limited cells. Mutation of dnrS affected nrdD and 
the expression of ferredoxin I as an element of the oxidative stress response. 
The dnrE gene is part of the nar region encoding functions for respiratory 
nitrate reduction. We found the highest amount of dnrE transcripts in 
aerobically nitrate-challenged cells. The gene was transcribed from two 
promoters, P1 and P2, of which promoter P1 was under the control of the nitrate 
response regulator NarL. The multiplicity of FNR factors in P. stutzeri 
underlines the versatility of the FNR scaffold to serve for transcriptional 
regulation directed at anaerobic or nitrate-activated metabolic processes.

Cleavage of chromosomal DNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO by Spel and Dpnl has 
been used together with PFGE and Southern hybridization to establish the map 
location of the following principal denitrification genes: narGH (encoding the 
large and small subunits of respiratory nitrate reductase), nirS (cytochrome-cd1 
nitrite reductase), nirE (uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase for haem d1 
biosynthesis), norCB (nitric-oxide reductase complex), nosZ (nitrous-oxide 
reductase) and nosA (an outer-membrane protein and OprC homologue). The study 
also included several genes related to anaerobic or microaerophilic metabolism: 
napA (encoding the catalytic subunit of the periplasmic nitrate reductase), ccoN 
(catalytic subunit of the cytochrome-cbb3 oxidase), hemN (oxygen-independent 
coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase), an fnr-like regulatory gene, and azu and fdxA 
(electron carriers azurin and ferredoxin, respectively). Genes necessary for 
denitrification are concentrated at 20 to 36 min on the P. aeruginosa 
chromosome, where they form three separate loci, the nir-nor, nar and nos gene 
clusters. Genomic DNA of Pseudomonas stutzeri ZoBell was also subjected to Spel 
restriction and Southern analysis to assign denitrification genes to individual 
fragments. A homologue of nosA encoding a putative component of the 
Cu-processing apparatus for nitrous-oxide reductase was identified. In both P. 
aeruginosa and P. stutzeri there is evidence for the linkage of anr (fnrA) with 
hemN and ccoN; and for the presence of a napA gene.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of exogenous carbon monoxide-releasing 
molecules 2 (CORM-2) on the vitality and toxicity of E. coli ATCC 25922, and to 
analyze the potential mechanism.
METHODS: (1) In vitro experiments. Standard strains of E. coli ATCC 25922 were 
divided into groups A (without addition), B, C, D, and E according to the random 
number table, and then the latter 4 groups were respectively cultured with 1.2 
mmol/L CORM-2, 1.6 mmol/L CORM-2, 1.2 mmol/L inactive CORM-2 (iCORM-2), 1.6 
mmol/L iCORM-2, with six samples in each group. After being cultured for 0, 3, 
5, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 27, 30, 48 hours, proliferative vitality of E. coli 
was examined (denoted as absorption value under 600 nm wavelength), and bacteria 
number was counted. Other standard strains of E. coli ATCC 25922 were divided 
into groups F (without addition) and G (cultured with 0.8 mmol/L CORM-2), the 
expressions of genes fliA, dnaK, marA, and waaQ related to E. coli were detected 
by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. (2) In vivo experiments. Other standard 
strains of E. coli ATCC 25922 were grouped as A', B', C', D', and E' and treated 
with the same method as that in groups A, B, C, D, and E, and 0.5 mL bacterial 
liquid of each group were collected when the absorption value of bacterial 
liquid in group A' was equal to 0.4 (under 600 nm wavelength). Seventy-two 
C57BL/6 mice were divided into groups, namely blank control (without treatment), 
H, I, J, K, and L according to the random number table, with 12 mice in each 
group. The mice in the latter 5 groups were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 
mL bacterial suspension of groups A', B', C', D', and E' respectively. After 
injection, general condition of mice in groups H, I, J, K, and L was observed. 
The serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were determined at post injection hour (PIH) 
6, 12. The liver and lung samples were harvested for determination of 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity at PIH 12. The same process was carried out in 
blank control group. Data were processed with repeated measure analysis of 
variance (ANOVA), factorial design ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, and t test.
RESULTS: (1) In vitro experiments. Compared with those of groups A and D, the 
proliferative vitality and bacteria number of E. coli in group B were all 
decreased (with F values respectively 1170.80, 217.52, P values all below 0.01). 
Compared with those of groups A and E, the proliferative vitality and bacteria 
number of E. coli in group C were also obviously decreased (with F values 
respectively 7948.34, 14 432.85, P values all below 0.01). Compared with those 
in group F, the expression of fliA was downregulated, while the expressions of 
dnaK, marA, and waaQ were upregulated in group G (with t values 30.28, -165.54, 
-168.88, -187.28, P values all below 0.01). (2) In vivo experiments. Symptoms 
including listlessness and tachypnea were observed in mice in groups H, K, and 
L, and they were ameliorated or not obvious in groups I and J. At PIH 6, the 
serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in groups H and K were respectively (647.3 ± 3.8) 
pg/mL, (3.44 ± 0.22) ng/mL and (639.3 ± 0.8) pg/mL, (2.47 ± 0.32) ng/mL, which 
were obviously higher than those in group I [(124.6 ± 10.7) pg/mL, (1.03 ± 0.16) 
ng/mL, with t values from 15.22 to 84.03, P values all below 0.01]. The serum 
levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in group J at PIH 6, 12 were also obviously decreased 
as compared with those in groups H and L (with t values from 19.27 to 245.34, P 
values all below 0.01). MPO activity of liver and lung tissues were 
significantly attenuated in group I at PIH 12 as compared with those in groups H 
and K, and it was also attenuated in group J when compared with those in groups 
H and L (with t values respectively from 17.36 to 18.92 and 2.35 to 3.61, P 
values all below 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: CORM-2 can obviously inhibit the vitality and toxicity of E. coli, 
which might be attributable to regulation of expressions of genes fliA, dnaK, 
marA, and waaQ of E. coli.

OBJECTIVES: Multidrug efflux pumps mediate resistance to antibiotics and other 
toxic compounds. We studied the role of AcrAB-TolC, the main efflux pump in 
Escherichia coli, in regulating gene expression.
METHODS: Deletion mutants, an acrABp-lacZ fusion and reverse 
transcription-real-time quantitative PCR experiments were used to study the role 
of AcrAB-TolC and metabolism in regulating gene expression of the acrAB operon 
and its transcriptional regulators.
RESULTS: Deletion of the acrB gene increased the expression of the acrAB operon. 
A similar induction of acrAB was found when acrA or tolC was deleted, and when 
the pump function was inhibited using phenylalanine-arginine-β-naphthylamide. 
The induction of acrAB in the ΔacrB strain was totally (AcrR or SoxS) or 
partially (SoxR or MarA) prevented when the genes for these acrAB regulators 
were also deleted. The expression of soxS and marA, but not of acrR, was 
increased in the ΔacrB strain, which also showed altered expression of many 
other genes related to different cellular processes, including motility. 
Deletion of the metabolic genes entA and entE (enterobactin biosysnthesis), glpX 
(gluconeogenesis), cysH (cysteine biosynthesis) and purA (purine biosynthesis) 
also prevented activation of the acrAB promoter in the ΔacrB strain. Addition of 
the enterobactin biosynthesis intermediate metabolite 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate 
induced the expression of acrAB.
CONCLUSIONS: These results together suggest a model in which the AcrAB-TolC pump 
effluxes cellular metabolites that are toxic and/or have a signalling role. If 
the pump is inactivated or inhibited, these metabolites would accumulate, 
inactivating AcrR and/or up-regulating soxS and marA expression, ultimately 
triggering the up-regulation of acrAB expression to restore homeostasis.

The color of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) petal is usually yellow but can be 
milky-white to orange or pink. Thus, the petal color is a popular target in 
rapeseed breeding programs. In his study, metabolites and RNA were extracted 
from the yellow (Y), yellow/purple (YP), light purple (LP), and purple (P) 
rapeseed petals. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), RNA-Seq, and quantitative real-time (qRT-PCR) 
analyses were performed to analyze the expression correlation of differential 
metabolites and differential genes. A total of 223 metabolites were identified 
in the petals of the three purple and yellow rapeseed varieties by UPLC-MS/MS. A 
total of 20511 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between P, LP, YP, versus Y 
plant petals were detected. This study focused on the co-regulation of 4898 
differential genes in the three comparison groups. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) functional annotation and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed 
that the expression of BnaA10g23330D (BnF3'H) affects the synthesis of 
downstream peonidin and delphinidin and is a key gene regulating the purple 
color of petals in B. napus. L. The gene may play a key role in regulating 
rapeseed flower color; however, further studies are needed to verify this. These 
results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying petal 
color and provide the theoretical and practical basis for flower breeding 
targeting petal color.

In this study, the efficacy of different nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) enzyme 
sources on wheat ingredients and wheat basal diets in vitro were evaluated by 
simulating the avian digestive tract. In Exp. 1, pH level was increased from 2.0 
to 8.0 by simulating the avian digestive tract. The relative enzyme activities 
of xylanase A, B, and C and β-glucanase X at pH 3.0-3.5 were higher (P < 0.05) 
than those at pH 2.0 or 7.0-8.0. The optimal pH levels of 3.5 and 7.0 were 
screened by simulating the proventriculus and small intestine, respectively to 
evaluate the efficacy of NSP enzyme on wheat sources. In Exp. 2, wheat 1 
contained the highest content of NSP fractions and the lowest digestibility in 
vitro dry matter (IVDMD) and energy (IVED) in wheat samples. Therefore, wheat 1 
was selected for hydrolysis research under different NSP enzyme sources and 
levels (1,500, 4,500, 13,500, 40,500, 121,500 U xylanase/kg and 250, 500, 1,000, 
2,000, 4,000 U β-glucanase/kg) in vitro. The hydrolysis of wheat on the basis of 
the released reducing sugar content was determined by xylanase sources A > B > C 
(P < 0.05) and β-glucanase sources of X > Y (P < 0.05). On the basis of the 
hydrolysis, the optimum dose of xylanase A and β-glucanase X were 40,500 U/kg 
and 2,000 U/kg, respectively. Subsequently, the completely randomized designs 
involving 2 NSP enzymes treatments × 2 endogenous digestive enzymes treatments 
(Exp. 3), as well as 2 wheat basal diets × 2 NSP enzymes treatments (Exp. 4) 
were used to evaluate the efficacy of NSP enzymes on dietary nutrient 
digestibility. The addition of NSP enzymes (40,500 U xylanase A/kg and 2,000 U 
β-glucanase X/kg) increased the IVDMD and IVED of wheat 1 without endogenous 
enzymes (P < 0.05), while the IVDMD and IVED of wheat 1 with endogenous enzyme 
were only slightly increased (P > 0.05). The addition of NSP enzymes could 
increase the IVDMD and IVED of corn-wheat-soybean meal diet (P < 0.05), but had 
no effect on those of wheat-cottonseed meal rapeseed meal diet (P > 0.05). In 
conclusion, xylanase and β-glucanase additions could effectively eliminate the 
adverse effects on wheat and wheat basal diets at the optimal pH levels of 3.5 
and 7.0 by simulating the proventriculus and small intestine parts, 
respectively. The efficacy of NSP enzymes was influenced by the enzyme sources, 
dietary type, and the interaction of endogenous enzymes.

Plain Language Summary: The inclusion level of wheat in poultry feeds is limited 
by nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP). Feeding NSP will increase the intestinal 
viscosity and residence time of the digesta, reduce nutrient digestion, and 
absorption of nutrients by birds, thereby damaging the intestinal function and 
growth performance. The degradation of NSP in feed by supplementing NSP enzymes 
has a positive effect on nutrient availability and growth performance. 
Therefore, there is a need for a quick and reliable method to assess the 
efficacy of NSP enzymes from different types, sources, and processing 
techniques. Compared with the expensive and time-consuming in vivo method for 
animal feeding experiments, in vitro digestion has been proved to be a rapid 
method for predicting the efficacy of exogenous enzymes in various parts of the 
avian digestive tract. Therefore, in this study, the efficacy of different NSP 
enzyme sources on wheat ingredients and wheat basal diets were evaluated in 
vitro by simulating the avian digestive tract.

MarA47(Yp) from Yersinia pestis, showing 47% identity to Escherichia coli MarA 
in its N terminus, caused resistance to antibiotics and to organic solvents when 
expressed in both E. coli and Y. pestis. Resistance was linked to increased 
expression of the AcrAB multidrug efflux pump. In four of five spontaneous 
multidrug-resistant mutants of Y. pestis independently selected by growth on 
tetracycline, the marA47(Yp) gene was overexpressed. The findings suggest that 
marA47(Yp) is a marA ortholog in Y. pestis.

The mitotic and meiotic chromosomes of the beetles Epicauta atomaria (Meloidae) 
and Palembus dermestoides (Tenebrionidae) were analysed using standard staining, 
C-banding and silver impregnation techniques. We determine the diploid and 
haploid chromosome numbers, the sex determination system and describe the 
chromosomal morphology, the C-banding pattern and the chromosome(s) bearing NORs 
(nucleolar organizer regions). Both species shown 2n = 20 chromosomes, the 
chromosomal meioformula 9 + Xyp, and regular chromosome segregation during 
anaphases I and II. The chromosomes of E. atomaria are basically metacentric or 
submetacentric and P. dermestoides chromosomes are submetacentric or 
subtelocentric. In both beetles the constitutive heterochromatin is located in 
the pericentromeric region in all autosomes and in the Xp chromosome; additional 
C-bands were observed in telomeric region of the short arm in some autosomes in 
P. dermestoides. The yp chromosome did not show typical C-bands in these 
species. As for the synaptonemal complex, the nucleolar material is associated 
to the 7th bivalent in E. atomaria and 3rd and 7th bivalents in P. dermestoides. 
Strong silver impregnated material was observed in association with Xyp in light 
and electron microscopy preparations in these species and this material was 
interpreted to be related to nucleolar material.

A competition mechanism regulates the translation of the Escherichia coli operon 
encoding ribosomal proteins L35 and L20.

Physico-Chimique, 13 rue Pierre et Marie Curie, 75005 Paris, France.

Escherichia coli ribosomal protein (r-protein) L20 is essential for the assembly 
of the 50S ribosomal subunit and is also a translational regulator of its own 
rpmI-rplT operon, encoding r-proteins L35 and L20 in that order. L20 directly 
represses the translation of the first cistron and, through translational 
coupling, that of its own gene. The translational operator of the operon is 450 
nt in length and includes a long-range pseudoknot interaction between two RNA 
sequences separated by 280 nt. L20 has the potential to bind both to this 
pseudoknot and to an irregular hairpin, although only one site is occupied at a 
time during regulation. This work shows that the rpmI-rplT operon is regulated 
by competition between L20 and the ribosome for binding to mRNA in vitro and in 
vivo. Detailed studies on the regulatory mechanisms of r-protein synthesis have 
only been performed on the rpsO gene, regulated by r-protein S15, and on the 
alpha operon, regulated by S4. Both are thought to be controlled by a trapping 
mechanism, whereby the 30S ribosomal subunit, the mRNA, and the initiator tRNA 
are blocked as a nonfunctional preternary complex. This alternative mode of 
regulation of the rpmI-rplT operon raises the possibility that control is 
kinetically and not thermodynamically limited in this case. We show that the 
pseudoknot, which is known to be essential for L20 binding and regulation, also 
enhances 30S binding to mRNA as if this structure is specifically recognised by 
the ribosome.

Ribosomal protein L20 controls expression of the Bacillus subtilis infC operon 
via a transcription attenuation mechanism.

Curie, 75005 Paris, France.

In contrast to Escherichia coli no molecular mechanism controlling the 
biosynthesis of ribosomal proteins has been elucidated in Gram-positive 
organisms. Here we show that the expression of the Bacillus subtilis 
infC-rpmI-rplT operon encoding translation factor IF3 and the ribosomal proteins 
L35 and L20 is autoregulated by a complex transcription attenuation mechanism. 
It implicates a 200-bp leader region upstream of infC which contains two 
conserved regulatory elements, one of which can act as a transcription 
terminator. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches we show that expression of the 
operon is regulated at the level of transcription elongation by a change in the 
structure of the leader mRNA which depends upon the presence of ribosomal 
protein L20. L20 binds to a phylogenetically conserved domain and provokes 
premature transcription termination at the leader terminator. Footprint and 
toeprint experiments support a regulatory model involving molecular mimicry 
between the L20-binding sites on 23S rRNA and the mRNA. Our data suggest that 
Nomura's model of ribosomal protein biosynthesis based on autogenous control and 
molecular mimicry is also valid in Gram-positive organisms.

To investigate the physiological roles of translation initiation factor IF3 and 
ribosomal protein L20 in Escherichia coli, the infC, rpmI and rpIT genes 
encoding IF3, L35 and L20, respectively, were placed under the control of lac 
promotor/operator sequences. Thus, their expression is dependent upon the amount 
of inducer isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) in the medium. Lysogenic strains 
were constructed with recombinant lambda phages that express either rpmI and 
rplT or infC and prmI in trans, thereby allowing depletion of only IF3 or L20 at 
low IPTG concentrations. At low cellular concentration of IF3, but not L20, 
decreases and the growth rate slows. Furthermore, ribosomes run off polysomes, 
indicating that IF3 functions during the initiation phase of protein synthesis 
in vivo. During slow growth, the ratio of RNA to protein increases rather than 
decreases as occurs with control strains, indicating that IF3 limitation 
disrupts feedback inhibition of rRNA synthesis. As IF3 levels drop, expression 
from an AUU-infC-lacZ fusion increases, whereas expression decreases from an 
AUG-infC-lacZ fusion, thereby confirming the model of autogenous regulation of 
infC. The effects of L20 limitation are similar; cells grown in low 
concentrations of IPTG exhibited a decrease in the rate of growth, a decrease in 
cellular L20 concentration, no change in IF3 concentration, and a small increase 
in the ratio of RNA to protein. In addition, a decrease in 50S subunits and the 
appearance of an aberrant ribosome peak at approximately 41-43S is seen. 
Previous studies have shown that the L20 protein negatively controls its own 
gene expression. Reduction of the cellular concentration of L20 derepresses the 
expression of an rplT-lacZ gene fusion, thus confirming autogenous regulation by 
L20.

A 4.5-kilobase DNA fragment from Buchnera aphidicola, the endosymbiont of the 
aphid Schizaphis graminum, was cloned and sequenced. On the basis of homology to 
Escherichia coli, the following genes were found in the order listed: 
aroH-thrS-infC-rpmI-rplT. AroH corresponds to the E. coli tryptophan-inhibited 
3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase. Evidence was 
presented indicating that this is the sole gene for DAHP synthase in the B. 
aphidicola genome. This enzyme initiates the complex branched pathway leading to 
aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The presence of aroH is consistent with past 
observations indicating that aphid endosymbionts are able to synthesize 
tryptophan for the aphid host. thrS, infC, rpmI, and rplT correspond to genes 
for threonine tRNA synthase, initiation factor-3, and large ribosome subunit 
proteins L35 and L20, respectively. Sequence comparisons indicate some 
differences and similarities between E. coli and B. aphidicola with respect to 
the possible regulation of synthesis of these proteins.

A specific 1542-bp DNA fragment was amplified from Mycoplasma fermentans 
(incognitus strain) using a unique 23-nucleotide (nt) synthetic 
deoxyribonucleotide (oligo) (5'-TCCAAAAAGTCCGGAATTTGGGG) as the primer pair in 
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 23-nt sequence is part of the 29-bp 
terminal inverted repeat (IR) which forms the left potential stem-and-loop (s&l) 
structure of the previously identified M. fermentans insertion-sequence(IS)-like 
genetic element [Hu et al., Gene 93 (1990) 67-72]. The amplified DNA was cloned 
and sequenced. A pair of 27-bp IR containing the 23-nt synthetic oligo was 
identified at both termini. Between the IR, there are four potential open 
reading frames (ORFs) which are arranged adjacent to each other in the order, 
ORF-1, ORF-2, ORF-3 and ORF-4, with parts of ORF-1 and ORF-2 overlapping. The 
deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of ORF-2, ORF-3 and ORF-4 are 34 to 60% 
identical to the translation initiation factor IF3 (encoded by the infC gene), 
ribosomal proteins L35 (rpmI gene) and L20 (rplT gene) of Escherichia coli and 
Bacillus stearothermophilus, respectively. In bacteria, the infC-rpmI-rplT genes 
are organized to function as an operon. There are multiple sites with 
promoter-like sequences identified upstream from the putative infC gene in the 
mycoplasma closely resembling the gene arrangement in the bacterial operon. All 
three genes of ORF-2, ORF-3 and ORF-4 are preceded individually by a strong 
appropriately spaced (7 and 10 bp) putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence 
(5'-AAGGA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The Escherichia coli infC-rpmI-rplT operon encodes translation initiation factor 
IF3 and the ribosomal proteins, L35 and L20, respectively. The expression of the 
last cistron (rplT) has been shown to be negatively regulated at a 
post-transcriptional level by its own product, L20, which acts at an internal 
operator located within infC. The present work shows that L20 directly represses 
the expression of rpmI, and indirectly that of rplT, via translational coupling 
with rpmI. Deletions and an inversion of the coding region of rpmI, suggest an 
mRNA secondary structure forming between sequences within rpmI and the 
translation initiation site of rplT. To verify the existence of this structure, 
detailed analyses were performed using chemical and enzymatic probes. Also, 
mutants that uncoupled rplT expression from that of rpmI, were isolated. The 
mutations fall at positions that would base-pair in the secondary structure. Our 
model is that L20 binds to its operator within infC and represses the 
translation of rpmI. When the rpmI mRNA is not translated, it can base-pair with 
the ribosomal binding site of rplT, sequestering it, and abolishing rplT 
expression. If the rpmI mRNA is translated, i.e. covered by ribosomes, the 
inhibitory structure cannot form leaving the translation initiation site of rplT 
free for ribosomal binding and for full expression. Although translational 
coupling in ribosomal protein operons has been suspected to be due to the 
formation of secondary structures that sequester internal ribosomal binding 
sites, this is the first time that such a structure has been shown to exist.

In vivo transcriptional pattern in the infC operon of Bacillus

By Northern blot and primer extension analyses it was shown that in Bacillus 
stearothermophilus the genes infC, rpmI and rplT constitute a single 
transcriptional unit; the promoter and the transcriptional start-point used in 
vivo were identified and the half-life of the transcript (1.2 min) was 
determined. No indication of multiple initiation sites nor of differential 
stability of different regions of the transcript was found. The results suggest 
that Escherichia coli and B. stearothermophilus have a different pattern of 
transcription around the infC gene cluster and that differential translational 
efficiency within the infC-rpmI-rplT transcriptional unit accounts for the 
different levels of IF3, L35 and L20 expression. The rare AUU initiation codon 
is the only strictly conserved element of the several peculiar transcriptional 
and translational features found in E. coli infC. Upon changing this codon to 
AUG, we found a ca. 30-fold increased expression of B. stearothermophilus infC, 
which is similar to that previously found with E. coli infC (i.e. 40-fold), and 
provided evidence that regulation of infC expression through its rare AUU 
initiation codon might be a general phenomenon in bacteria.

Translated translational operator in Escherichia coli. Auto-regulation in the 
infC-rpmI-rplT operon.

The genes coding for translation initiation factor IF3 (infC) and for the 
ribosomal proteins L35 (rpmI) and L20 (rplT) are transcribed in that order from 
a promoter in front of infC. The last two cistrons of the operon (rpmI and rplT) 
can be transcribed from a weak secondary promoter situated within the first 
cistron (infC). Previous experiments have shown that the expression of infC, the 
first cistron of the operon, is negatively autoregulated at the translational 
level and that the abnormal AUU initiation codon of infC is responsible for the 
control. We show that the expression of the last cistron (rplT) is also 
autoregulated at the posttranscriptional level. The L20 concentration regulates 
the level of rplT expression by acting in trans at a site located within the 
first cistron (infC) and thus different from that at which IF3 is known to act. 
This regulatory site, several hundred nucleotides upstream from the target gene 
(rplT), was identified through deletions, insertions and a point mutation. Thus, 
the expression of the operon is controlled in trans by the products of two 
different cistrons acting at two different sites. The localization within an 
open reading frame (infC) of a regulatory site acting in cis on the translation 
of a downstream gene (rplT) is new and was unforeseen since ribosomes 
translating through the regulatory site might be expected to impair either the 
binding of L20 or the mRNA secondary structure change caused by the binding. The 
possible competition between translation of the regions acting in cis and the 
regulation of the expression of the target gene is discussed.

Using two synthetic deoxyribonucleotide probes encoding segments of the primary 
structure of initiation factor IF3 from Bacillus stearothermophilus, we 
identified and cloned a segment of DNA which carries the infC gene. As in 
Escherichia coli, the infC gene begins with the unusual initiation triplet AUU, 
and is followed by the structural genes for ribosomal proteins L35 and L20 (rpmI 
and rplT, respectively).

Primary structures of and genes for new ribosomal proteins A and B in 
Escherichia coli.

Wada A, Sako T.

We determined the partial primary structures of and identified the genes for new 
basic proteins A and B in Escherichia coli ribosomal 50S subunits, found by 
means of an improved two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method. The sequence up 
to the 17th amino acid of protein B was in agreement with that of the X gene in 
the spc operon. The gene for protein A was searched for in the GenBank data base 
using the sequence up to the 35th amino acid, and was found at a locus between 
infC and rplT. The base sequence indicated that protein A contained 64 amino 
acids and had a molecular weight of 6,984. We conclude that proteins A and B are 
intrinsic ribosomal proteins, and propose calling their genes, rpmI and rpmJ, 
respectively.

A promoter is one of the most important and basic tools used to achieve diverse 
synthetic biology goals. Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used model 
organisms in synthetic biology to produce useful target products and establish 
complicated regulation networks. During the fine-tuning of metabolic or 
regulation networks, the limited number of well-characterized inducible 
promoters has made implementing complicated strategies difficult. In this study, 
104 native promoter-5'-UTR complexes (PUTR) from E. coli were screened and 
characterized based on a series of RNA-seq data. The strength of the 104 PUTRs 
varied from 0.007% to 4630% of that of the PBAD promoter in the transcriptional 
level and from 0.1% to 137% in the translational level. To further upregulate 
gene expression, a series of combinatorial PUTRs and cascade PUTRs were 
constructed by integrating strong transcriptional promoters with strong 
translational 5'-UTRs. Finally, two combinatorial PUTRs (PssrA-UTRrpsT and 
PdnaKJ-UTRrpsT) and two cascade PUTRs (PUTRssrA-PUTRinfC-rplT and 
PUTRalsRBACE-PUTRinfC-rplT) were identified as having the highest activity, with 
expression outputs of 170%, 137%, 409%, and 203% of that of the PBAD promoter, 
respectively. These engineered PUTRs are stable for the expression of different 
genes, such as the red fluorescence protein gene and the β-galactosidase gene. 
These results show that the PUTRs characterized and constructed in this study 
may be useful as a plug-and-play synthetic biology toolbox to achieve 
complicated metabolic engineering goals in fine-tuning metabolic networks to 
produce target products.

Ribosomal protein L20 controls expression of the Bacillus subtilis infC operon 
via a transcription attenuation mechanism.

Curie, 75005 Paris, France.

In contrast to Escherichia coli no molecular mechanism controlling the 
biosynthesis of ribosomal proteins has been elucidated in Gram-positive 
organisms. Here we show that the expression of the Bacillus subtilis 
infC-rpmI-rplT operon encoding translation factor IF3 and the ribosomal proteins 
L35 and L20 is autoregulated by a complex transcription attenuation mechanism. 
It implicates a 200-bp leader region upstream of infC which contains two 
conserved regulatory elements, one of which can act as a transcription 
terminator. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches we show that expression of the 
operon is regulated at the level of transcription elongation by a change in the 
structure of the leader mRNA which depends upon the presence of ribosomal 
protein L20. L20 binds to a phylogenetically conserved domain and provokes 
premature transcription termination at the leader terminator. Footprint and 
toeprint experiments support a regulatory model involving molecular mimicry 
between the L20-binding sites on 23S rRNA and the mRNA. Our data suggest that 
Nomura's model of ribosomal protein biosynthesis based on autogenous control and 
molecular mimicry is also valid in Gram-positive organisms.

ribosomal proteins L35 (rpmI) and L20 (rplT) are transcribed in that order from 
a promoter in front of infC. The last two cistrons of the operon (rpmI and rplT) 
can be transcribed from a weak secondary promoter situated within the first 
cistron (infC). Previous experiments have shown that the expression of infC, the 
first cistron of the operon, is negatively autoregulated at the translational 
level and that the abnormal AUU initiation codon of infC is responsible for the 
control. We show that the expression of the last cistron (rplT) is also 
autoregulated at the posttranscriptional level. The L20 concentration regulates 
the level of rplT expression by acting in trans at a site located within the 
first cistron (infC) and thus different from that at which IF3 is known to act. 
This regulatory site, several hundred nucleotides upstream from the target gene 
(rplT), was identified through deletions, insertions and a point mutation. Thus, 
the expression of the operon is controlled in trans by the products of two 
different cistrons acting at two different sites. The localization within an 
open reading frame (infC) of a regulatory site acting in cis on the translation 
of a downstream gene (rplT) is new and was unforeseen since ribosomes 
translating through the regulatory site might be expected to impair either the 
binding of L20 or the mRNA secondary structure change caused by the binding. The 
possible competition between translation of the regions acting in cis and the 
regulation of the expression of the target gene is discussed.

Using two synthetic deoxyribonucleotide probes encoding segments of the primary 
structure of initiation factor IF3 from Bacillus stearothermophilus, we 
identified and cloned a segment of DNA which carries the infC gene. As in 
Escherichia coli, the infC gene begins with the unusual initiation triplet AUU, 
and is followed by the structural genes for ribosomal proteins L35 and L20 (rpmI 
and rplT, respectively).

The genes coding for threonyl-tRNA synthetase (thrS), translation initiation 
factor 3 (infC) and ribosomal protein L20 (rplT) are clustered in the 
Escherichia coli genome. Previous studies had suggested the possibility that the 
expression of these genes is coupled. The transcriptional events in this operon 
have now been examined by S1 nuclease mapping and promoter fusion studies. The 
results indicate that infC-containing mRNAs are initiated from three separate 
promoters. Two of these are located in the protein-coding region of thrS and 
one, P12, is the major promoter at all growth rates tested. In addition, there 
is co-transcription of thrS and infC from the thrS promoter (PT). A single 
promoter for thrS has been mapped approx. 170 nucleotides upstream from its 
translation initiation site. Another promoter has been located within the 
infC-coding region. It is separated from the next downstream gene, rplT, by a 
transcription end point. However, termination at this region is only 50-70% 
efficient and transcripts starting at this promoter can read through into rplT. 
These findings demonstrate that the pattern of transcription in this operon is 
highly complex and the mRNA levels for each of the genes is determined by a 
variety of factors, including multiple promoters, co-transcription and 
readthrough of transcription termination signals.

Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Buchnera aphidicola (endosymbiont of

A 4.5-kilobase DNA fragment from Buchnera aphidicola, the endosymbiont of the 
aphid Schizaphis graminum, was cloned and sequenced. On the basis of homology to 
Escherichia coli, the following genes were found in the order listed: 
aroH-thrS-infC-rpmI-rplT. AroH corresponds to the E. coli tryptophan-inhibited 
3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase. Evidence was 
presented indicating that this is the sole gene for DAHP synthase in the B. 
aphidicola genome. This enzyme initiates the complex branched pathway leading to 
aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The presence of aroH is consistent with past 
observations indicating that aphid endosymbionts are able to synthesize 
tryptophan for the aphid host. thrS, infC, rpmI, and rplT correspond to genes 
for threonine tRNA synthase, initiation factor-3, and large ribosome subunit 
proteins L35 and L20, respectively. Sequence comparisons indicate some 
differences and similarities between E. coli and B. aphidicola with respect to 
the possible regulation of synthesis of these proteins.

The root-colonizing bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens BL915 protects a variety 
of seedlings from damping-off disease caused by the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia 
solani. Spontaneous pleiotropic mutants of P. fluorescens strain BL915 which 
fail to synthesize antifungal factors such as chitinase, cyanide, and 
pyrrolnitrin and exhibit altered colony morphology were isolated. Such mutants 
fail to inhibit the growth of R. solani in vitro, and their biological control 
capability is sharply reduced. We characterized a genomic DNA fragment from 
strain BL915 which, when introduced into these pleiotropic mutants, restored the 
lost functions, the wild-type colony morphology, and bio-control activity. DNA 
sequence analysis of the genomic fragment revealed the presence of genes 
homologous to those of numerous bacterial global regulatory systems and 
identified a cluster of genes identical in organization to the Escherichia coli 
gene cluster consisting of uvrY, uvrC, pgsA, and glyW. Coordinate biosynthesis 
of multiple antifungal products in some heterologous Pseudomonas strains in 
response to the introduction of the strain BL915 genomic fragment confirmed the 
regulatory nature of sequences contained on this fragment. Further genetic 
analysis indicated a gene homologous to response regulators of bacterial 
two-component systems was sufficient to complement the pleiotropic mutants and 
to activate antifungal genes in heterologous strains. Marker exchange of a 
truncated version of this gene into the P. fluorescens BL915 chromosome 
generated pleiotropic mutants indistinguishable from the original spontaneous 
mutants. Cloning and sequencing of the response regulator gene from several 
spontaneous mutants allowed identification of various nucleotide changes 
associated with the gene in such mutants.

Global impact of sdiA amplification revealed by comprehensive gene expression 
profiling of Escherichia coli.

In Escherichia coli the amplification of sdiA, a positive activator of ftsQAZ, 
genes that are essential for septation, results in mitomycin C resistance. To 
help us understand this resistance phenotype, genes whose expression was altered 
by increased sdiA dosage were identified using a DNA microarray-based, 
comprehensive transcript profiling method. The expression of 62 genes was 
reduced by more than threefold; of these, 41 are involved in motility and 
chemotaxis. Moreover, the expression of 75 genes, 36 of which had been 
previously characterized, was elevated at least threefold. As expected, 
increased sdiA dosage led to significantly elevated sdiA and 'ddlB-ftsQAZ-lpxC 
operon expression. Transcription of two genes, uvrY and uvrC, located downstream 
of sdiA and oriented in the same direction, was elevated about 10-fold, although 
the intervening gene, yecF, of opposite polarity was unaffected by increased 
sdiA dosage. Three genes (mioC and gidAB) flanking the replication origin, oriC, 
were transcribed more often when sdiA dosage was high, as were 12 genes within 1 
min of a terminus of replication, terB. Transcription of the acrABDEF genes, 
mapping in three widely spaced loci, was elevated significantly, while several 
genes involved in DNA repair and replication (e.g., nei, recN, mioC, and mcrC) 
were moderately elevated in expression. Such global analysis provides a link 
between septation and the response to DNA-damaging agents.

Agricultural Sciences, Sweden.

Production of extracellular, plant cell wall degrading enzymes, the main 
virulence determinants of the plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. 
carotovora, is coordinately controlled by a complex regulatory network. 
Insertion mutants in the exp (extracellular enzyme production) loci exhibit 
pleiotropic defects in virulence and the growth-phase-dependent transcriptional 
activation of genes encoding extracellular enzymes. Two new exp mutations, 
designated expA and expS, were characterized. Introduction of the corresponding 
wild-type alleles to the mutants complemented both the lack of virulence and the 
impaired production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes. The expA gene was 
shown to encode a 24-kDa polypeptide that is structurally and functionally 
related to the uvrY gene product of Escherichia coli and the GacA response 
regulator of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Functional similarity of expA and uvrY was 
demonstrated by genetic complementation. The expA gene is organized in an operon 
together with a uvrC-like gene, identical to the organization of uvrY and uvrC 
in E. coli. The unlinked expS gene encodes a putative sensor kinase that shows 
92% identity to the recently described rpfA gene product from another E. 
carotovora subsp. carotovora strain. Our data suggest that ExpS and ExpA are 
members of two-component sensor kinase and response regulator families, 
respectively. These two proteins might interact in controlling virulence gene 
expression in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora.

Global control in Pseudomonas fluorescens mediating antibiotic synthesis and 
suppression of black root rot of tobacco.

Switzerland.

Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 colonizes plant roots, produces several secondary 
metabolites in stationary growth phase, and suppresses a number of plant 
diseases, including Thielaviopsis basicola-induced black root rot of tobacco. We 
discovered that mutations in a P. fluorescens gene named gacA (for global 
antibiotic and cyanide control) pleiotropically block the production of the 
secondary metabolites 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (Phl), HCN, and pyoluteorin. 
The gacA mutants of strain CHA0 have a drastically reduced ability to suppress 
black root rot under gnotobiotic conditions, supporting the previous 
observations that the antibiotic Phl and HCN individually contribute to the 
suppression of black root rot. The gacA gene is directly followed by a uvrC 
gene. Double gacA-uvrC mutations render P. fluorescens sensitive to UV 
irradiation. The gacA-uvrC cluster is homologous to the orf-2 (= uvrY)-uvrC 
operon of Escherichia coli. The gacA gene specifies a trans-active 24-kDa 
protein. Sequence data indicate that the GacA protein is a response regulator in 
the FixJ/DegU family of two-component regulatory systems. Expression of the gacA 
gene itself was increased in stationary phase. We propose that GacA, perhaps 
activated by conditions of restricted growth, functions as a global regulator of 
secondary metabolism in P. fluorescens.

Bacteria have to process several levels of gene regulation and coordination of 
interconnected regulatory networks to ensure the most adequate cellular response 
to specific growth conditions. Especially, expression of complex and costly 
fitness and pathogenicity-associated traits is coordinated and tightly regulated 
at multiple levels. We studied the interconnected regulation of the expression 
of the colibactin and yersiniabactin polyketide biosynthesis machineries, which 
are encoded by two pathogenicity islands found in many phylogroup B2 Escherichia 
coli isolates. Comparative phenotypic and genotypic analyses identified the 
BarA-UvrY two-component system as an important regulatory element involved in 
colibactin and yersiniabactin expression. The carbon storage regulator (Csr) 
system controls the expression of a wide range of central metabolic and 
virulence-associated traits. The availability of CsrA, the key translational 
regulator of the Csr system, depends on BarA-UvrY activity. We employed reporter 
gene fusions to demonstrate UvrY- and CsrA-dependent expression of the 
colibactin and yersiniabactin determinants and confirmed a direct interaction of 
CsrA with the 5' untranslated leader transcripts of representative genes of the 
colibactin and yersiniabactin operons by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift 
assays. This posttranscriptional regulation adds an additional level of 
complexity to control mechanisms of polyketide expression, which is also 
orchestrated at the level of ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-dependent regulation 
of transcription and phosphopantetheinyl transferase-dependent activation of 
polyketide biosynthesis. Our results emphasize the interconnection of iron- and 
primary metabolism-responsive regulation of colibactin and yersiniabactin 
expression by the fine-tuned action of different regulatory mechanisms in 
response to variable environmental signals as a prerequisite for bacterial 
adaptability, fitness, and pathogenicity in different habitats. IMPORTANCE 
Secondary metabolite expression is a widespread strategy among bacteria to 
improve their fitness in habitats where they constantly compete for resources 
with other bacteria. The production of secondary metabolites is associated with 
a metabolic and energetic burden. Colibactin and yersiniabactin are two 
polyketides, which are expressed in concert and promote the virulence of 
different enterobacterial pathogens. To maximize fitness, they should be 
expressed only in microenvironments in which they are required. Accordingly, 
precise regulation of colibactin and yersiniabactin expression is crucial. We 
show that the expression of these two polyketides is also interconnected via 
primary metabolism-responsive regulation at the posttranscriptional level by the 
CsrA RNA-binding protein. Our findings may help to optimize (over-)expression 
and further functional characterization of the polyketide colibactin. 
Additionally, this new aspect of concerted colibactin and yersiniabactin 
expression extends our knowledge of conditions that favor the expression of 
these virulence- and fitness-associated factors in different Enterobacterales 
members.

The Escherichia coli two-component signal sensor BarA binds protonated acetate 
via a conserved hydrophobic-binding pocket.

The BarA/UvrY two-component signal transduction system is widely conserved in 
γ-proteobacteria and provides a link between the metabolic state of the cells 
and the Csr posttranscriptional regulatory system. In Escherichia coli, the 
BarA/UvrY system responds to the presence of acetate and other short-chain 
carboxylic acids by activating transcription of the noncoding RNAs, CsrB and 
CsrC, which sequester the RNA-binding protein CsrA, a global regulator of gene 
expression. However, the state of the carboxyl group in the acetate molecule, 
which serves as the BarA stimulus, and the signal reception site of BarA remain 
unknown. In this study, we show that the deletion or replacement of the 
periplasmic domain of BarA and also the substitution of certain hydroxylated and 
hydrophobic amino acid residues in this region, result in a sensor kinase that 
remains unresponsive to its physiological stimulus, demonstrating that the 
periplasmic region of BarA constitutes a functional detector domain. Moreover, 
we provide evidence that the protonated state of acetate or formate serves as 
the physiological stimulus of BarA. In addition, modeling of the BarA sensor 
domain and prediction of the signal-binding site, by blind molecular docking, 
revealed a calcium channels and chemotaxis receptors domain with a conserved 
binding pocket, which comprised uncharged polar and hydrophobic amino acid 
residues. Based on the comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses, we 
propose that, at least, two types of BarA orthologues diverged and evolved 
separately to acquire distinct signal-binding properties, illustrating the wide 
adaptability of the bacterial sensor kinase proteins.

Regulatory loop between the CsrA system and NhaR, a high salt/high pH regulator.

Author information:

Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.

In E. coli, under high pH/high salt conditions, a major Na+/H+ antiporter (NhaA) 
is activated to maintain an internal pH level. Its expression is induced by a 
specific regulator NhaR, which is also responsible for osmC and pgaA regulation. 
Here I report that the NhaR regulator affects the carbon storage regulatory Csr 
system. I found that the expression of all major components of the Csr 
system-CsrA regulator, CsrB and CsrC small RNAs, and the CsrB and CsrC stability 
were indirectly affected by nhaR mutation under stress conditions. Using a 
combination of experimental and in silico analyses, I concluded that the 
mechanism of regulation included direct and indirect activation of a 
two-component system (TCS) response regulator-UvrY. NhaR regulation involved 
interactions with the regulators H-NS and SdiA and was affected by a naturally 
occurring spontaneous IS5 insertion in the promoter region. A regulatory circuit 
was proposed and discussed.

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the cAMP receptor protein (cAMP-CRP) and CsrA are the 
principal regulators of the catabolite repression and carbon storage global 
regulatory systems, respectively. cAMP-CRP controls the transcription of genes 
for carbohydrate metabolism and other processes in response to carbon 
nutritional status, while CsrA binds to diverse mRNAs and regulates translation, 
RNA stability, and/or transcription elongation. CsrA also binds to the 
regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) CsrB and CsrC, which antagonize its activity. The 
BarA-UvrY two-component signal transduction system (TCS) directly activates csrB 
and csrC (csrB/C) transcription, while CsrA does so indirectly. We show that 
cAMP-CRP inhibits csrB/C transcription without negatively regulating 
phosphorylated UvrY (P-UvrY) or CsrA levels. A crp deletion caused an elevation 
in CsrB/C levels in the stationary phase of growth and increased the expression 
of csrB-lacZ and csrC-lacZ transcriptional fusions, although modest stimulation 
of CsrB/C turnover by the crp deletion partially masked the former effects. 
DNase I footprinting and other studies demonstrated that cAMP-CRP bound 
specifically to three sites located upstream from the csrC promoter, two of 
which overlapped the P-UvrY binding site. These two proteins competed for 
binding at the overlapping sites. In vitro transcription-translation experiments 
confirmed direct repression of csrC-lacZ expression by cAMP-CRP. In contrast, 
cAMP-CRP effects on csrB transcription may be mediated indirectly, as it bound 
nonspecifically to csrB DNA. In the reciprocal direction, CsrA bound to crp mRNA 
with high affinity and specificity and yet exhibited only modest, conditional 
effects on expression. Our findings are incorporated into an emerging model for 
the response of Csr circuitry to carbon nutritional status.
IMPORTANCE: Csr (Rsm) noncoding small RNAs (sRNAs) CsrB and CsrC of Escherichia 
coli use molecular mimicry to sequester the RNA binding protein CsrA (RsmA) away 
from lower-affinity mRNA targets, thus eliciting major shifts in the bacterial 
lifestyle. CsrB/C transcription and turnover are activated by carbon metabolism 
products (e.g., formate and acetate) and by a preferred carbon source (glucose), 
respectively. We show that cAMP-CRP, a mediator of classical catabolite 
repression, inhibits csrC transcription by binding to the upstream region of 
this gene and also inhibits csrB transcription, apparently indirectly. We 
propose that glucose availability activates pathways for both synthesis and 
turnover of CsrB/C, thus shaping the dynamics of global signaling in response to 
the nutritional environment by poising CsrB/C sRNA levels for rapid response.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) biofilm formation enables the organism to 
avoid the host immune system, resist antibiotics, and provide a reservoir for 
persistent infection. Once the biofilm is established, eradication of the 
infection becomes difficult. Therefore, strategies against UPEC biofilm are 
urgently required. In this study, we investigated the effect of allicin, 
isolated from garlic essential oil, on UPEC CFT073 and J96 biofilm formation and 
dispersal, along with its effect on UPEC adhesion ability and swimming motility. 
Sub-inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of allicin decreased UPEC biofilm 
formation and affected its architecture. Allicin was also capable of dispersing 
biofilm. Furthermore, allicin decreased the bacterial adhesion ability and 
swimming motility, which are important for biofilm formation. Real-time 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that allicin decreased 
the expression of UPEC type 1 fimbriae adhesin gene fimH. Docking studies 
suggested that allicin was located within the binding pocket of heptyl 
α-d-mannopyrannoside in FimH and formed hydrogen bonds with Phe1 and Asn135. In 
addition, allicin decreased the expression of the two-component regulatory 
systems (TCSs) cognate response regulator gene uvrY and increased the expression 
of the RNA binding global regulatory protein gene csrA of UPEC CFT073, which is 
associated with UPEC biofilm. The findings suggest that sub-MICs of allicin are 
capable of affecting UPEC biofilm formation and dispersal, and decreasing UPEC 
adhesion ability and swimming motility.

The quorum sensing molecule Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is generated as a byproduct of 
activated methyl cycle by the action of LuxS in Escherichia coli. AI-2 is 
synthesized, released and later internalized in a cell-density dependent manner. 
Here, by mutational analysis of the genes, uvrY and csrA, we describe a 
regulatory circuit of accumulation and uptake of AI-2. We constructed a 
single-copy chromosomal luxS-lacZ fusion in a luxS + merodiploid strain and 
evaluated its relative expression in uvrY and csrA mutants. At the entry of 
stationary phase, the expression of the fusion and AI-2 accumulation was 
positively regulated by uvrY and negatively regulated by csrA respectively. A 
deletion of csrA altered message stability of the luxS transcript and CsrA 
protein exhibited weak binding to 5' luxS regulatory region. DNA protein 
interaction and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed direct 
interaction of UvrY with the luxS promoter. Additionally, reduced expression of 
the fusion in hfq deletion mutant suggested involvement of small RNA 
interactions in luxS regulation. In contrast, the expression of lsrA operon 
involved in AI-2 uptake, is negatively regulated by uvrY and positively by csrA 
in a cell-density dependent manner. The dual role of csrA in AI-2 synthesis and 
uptake suggested a regulatory crosstalk of cell signaling with carbon regulation 
in Escherichia coli. We found that the cAMP-CRP mediated catabolite repression 
of luxS expression was uvrY dependent. This study suggests that luxS expression 
is complex and regulated at the level of transcription and translation. The 
multifactorial regulation supports the notion that cell-cell communication 
requires interaction and integration of multiple metabolic signals.

The two-component signal transduction system BarA-UvrY of Escherichia coli and 
its orthologs globally regulate metabolism, motility, biofilm formation, stress 
resistance, virulence of pathogens and quorum sensing by activating the 
transcription of genes for regulatory sRNAs, e.g. CsrB and CsrC in E. coli. 
These sRNAs act by sequestering the RNA binding protein CsrA (RsmA) away from 
lower affinity mRNA targets. In this study, we used ChIP-exo to identify, at 
single nucleotide resolution, genomic sites for UvrY (SirA) binding in E. coli 
and Salmonella enterica. The csrB and csrC genes were the strongest targets of 
crosslinking, which required UvrY phosphorylation by the BarA sensor kinase. 
Crosslinking occurred at two sites, an inverted repeat sequence far upstream of 
the promoter and a site near the -35 sequence. DNAse I footprinting revealed 
specific binding of UvrY in vitro only to the upstream site, indicative of 
additional binding requirements and/or indirect binding to the downstream site. 
Additional genes, including cspA, encoding the cold-shock RNA-binding protein 
CspA, showed weaker crosslinking and modest or negligible regulation by UvrY. We 
conclude that the global effects of UvrY/SirA on gene expression are primarily 
mediated by activating csrB and csrC transcription. We also used in vivo 
crosslinking and other experimental approaches to reveal new features of 
csrB/csrC regulation by the DeaD and SrmB RNA helicases, IHF, ppGpp and DksA. 
Finally, the phylogenetic distribution of BarA-UvrY was analyzed and found to be 
uniquely characteristic of γ-Proteobacteria and strongly anti-correlated with 
fliW, which encodes a protein that binds to CsrA and antagonizes its activity in 
Bacillus subtilis. We propose that BarA-UvrY and orthologous TCS transcribe sRNA 
antagonists of CsrA throughout the γ-Proteobacteria, but rarely or never perform 
this function in other species.

The hybrid sensor kinase BarA and its cognate response regulator UvrY, members 
of the two-component signal transduction family, activate transcription of CsrB 
and CsrC noncoding RNAs. These two small RNAs act by sequestering the RNA 
binding protein CsrA, which posttranscriptionally regulates translation and/or 
stability of its target mRNAs. Here, we provide evidence that CsrA positively 
affects, although indirectly, uvrY expression, at both the transcriptional and 
translational levels. We also demonstrate that CsrA is required for properly 
switching BarA from its phosphatase to its kinase activity. Thus, the existence 
of a feedback loop mechanism that involves the Csr and BarA/UvrY global 
regulatory systems is exposed.

In Escherichia coli, activity of the global regulatory RNA binding protein CsrA 
is antagonized by two non-coding sRNAs, CsrB and CsrC, which sequester it away 
from its lower affinity mRNA targets. Transcription of csrB/C requires the 
BarA-UvrY two component signal transduction system, which responds to short 
chain carboxylates. We show that two DEAD-box RNA helicases, DeaD and SrmB, 
activate csrB/C expression by different pathways. DeaD facilitates uvrY 
translation by counteracting the inhibitory effect of long distance base-pairing 
between the uvrY mRNA leader and coding region, while SrmB does not affect UvrY 
or UvrY-phosphate levels. Contrary to the prevailing notion that these helicases 
act primarily at low temperatures, DeaD and SrmB activated csrB expression over 
a wide temperature range. High-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by 
cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) revealed in vivo interactions of 
DeaD with 39 mRNAs, including those of uvrY and 9 other regulatory genes. 
Studies on the expression of several of the identified genes revealed regulatory 
effects of DeaD in all cases and diverse temperature response patterns. Our 
findings uncover an expanded regulatory role for DeaD, which is mediated through 
novel mRNA targets, important global regulators and under physiological 
conditions that were considered to be incompatible with its function.

Urinary tract infections primarily caused by uropathogenic strains of 
Escherichia coli (E. coli) remain a significant public health problem in both 
developed and developing countries. An important virulence determinant in 
uropathogenesis is biofilm formation which requires expression of fimbriae, 
flagella, and other surface components such as lipopolysaccharides. In this 
study, we explored the regulation of uvrY and csrA genes in biofilm formation, 
motility and virulence determinants in uropathogenic E. coli. We found that 
mutation in uvrY suppressed biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces such as 
polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene and glass, and complementation of uvrY in the 
mutant restored the biofilm phenotype. We further evaluated the role of uvrY 
gene in expression of type 1 fimbriae, an important adhesin that facilitates 
adhesion to various abiotic surfaces. We found that phase variation of type 1 
fimbriae between fimbriated and afimbriated mode was modulated by uvrY at its 
transcriptional level. Deletion mutant of uvrY lowered expression of fimbrial 
recombinase genes, such as fimB, fimE, and fimA, a gene encoding major fimbrial 
subunit. Furthermore, transcription of virulence specific genes such as papA, 
hlyB and galU was also reduced in the deletion mutant. Swarming motility and 
expression of flhD and flhC was also diminished in the mutant. Taken together, 
our findings unravel a possible mechanism in which uvrY facilitates biofilm 
formation, persistence and virulence of uropathogenic E. coli.

BACKGROUND/AIM: One of the most studied bacterial resistance mechanisms is the 
resistance related to multidrug efflux pumps. In our study the pump activity of 
the Escherichia coli K-12 AG100 strain expressing the AcrAB-TolC pump system was 
investigated at pH 7 and pH 5 in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) 
promethazine (PMZ).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EPI activity was assessed by real-time fluorimetry. 
The influence of PMZ treatment on the relative expression of the pump genes 
acrA, acrB and their regulators marA, marB, marR, the stress genes soxS, rob, as 
well as the bacterial growth control genes ftsI, and sdiA were determined by 
RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: The EPI activity of PMZ was more effective at neutral pH. The PMZ 
treatment induced a significant stress response in the bacterium at acidic pH by 
the up-regulation of genes.
CONCLUSION: The genetic system that regulates the activity of the main efflux 
pump is pH-dependent.

The mechanisms responsible for the increase in ceftazidime MIC in two 
Escherichia coli in vitro selected mutants, Caz/20-1 and Caz/20-2, were studied. 
OmpF loss and overexpression of acrB, acrD and acrF that were associated with 
acrR and marR mutations and sdiA overexpression, together with mutations A233T 
and I332V in FtSI (PBP3) resulted in ceftazidime resistance in Caz/20-2, 
multiplying by 128-fold the ceftazidime MIC in the parental clinical isolate 
PS/20. Absence of detectable β-lactamase hydrolytic activity in the crude 
extract of Caz/20-2 was observed, and coincided with Q191K and P209S mutations 
in AmpC and a nucleotide substitution at -28 in the ampC promoter, whereas 
β-lactamase hydrolytic activity in crude extracts of PS/20 and Caz/20-1 strains 
was detected. Nevertheless, a fourfold increase in ceftazidime MIC in Caz/20-1 
compared with that in PS/20 was due to the increased transcript level of acrB 
derived from acrR mutation. The two Caz mutants and PS/20 showed the same 
mutations in AmpG and ParE.

OBJECTIVES: The role of sdiA in the acquisition of low-level multidrug 
resistance (MDR) was analysed and compared with that of marA and soxS in two 
Escherichia coli clinical isolates and two in vitro-selected mutants.
METHODS: The mutants were developed by growth in lomefloxacin and ceftazidime. 
The sdiA, marA, soxS, ftsI, tolC and acrB gene transcript levels were determined 
by RT-PCR. Analyses of 2,4-dinitrophenol susceptibility, the effect of an active 
efflux inhibitor on antibiotic and mitomycin C susceptibility, beta-lactamase 
hydrolytic activity, outer and inner membrane proteins and acrR gene sequencing 
were also performed.
RESULTS: Both mutants showed elevated marA and sdiA gene transcript levels, 
which were associated with increased susceptibility to 2,4-dinitrophenol; soxS 
overexpression was only seen in the mutant selected with ceftazidime. The two 
mutants showed MDR phenotypes in which ceftazidime, cefpirome and aztreonam MICs 
increased 4- to 128-fold, in addition to decreased susceptibility to quinolones, 
chloramphenicol and mitomycin C. The highest ceftazidime MIC in one of the 
mutants coincided with a frameshift mutation in acrR and the highest transcript 
level of ftsI (penicillin-binding protein 3), but not with a higher 
beta-lactamase activity. Likewise, active efflux associated with increased 
levels of acrB and tolC and decreased OmpF expression contributed to low-level 
MDR in both mutants.
CONCLUSIONS: marA and sdiA overexpression was a common feature of 
multidrug-resistant mutants selected by growth in lomefloxacin and ceftazidime. 
To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe in vitro selection with a 
fluoroquinolone or ceftazidime triggering sdiA overexpression in E. coli 
isolates.

In Escherichia coli the amplification of sdiA, a positive activator of ftsQAZ, 
genes that are essential for septation, results in mitomycin C resistance. To 
help us understand this resistance phenotype, genes whose expression was altered 
by increased sdiA dosage were identified using a DNA microarray-based, 
comprehensive transcript profiling method. The expression of 62 genes was 
reduced by more than threefold; of these, 41 are involved in motility and 
chemotaxis. Moreover, the expression of 75 genes, 36 of which had been 
previously characterized, was elevated at least threefold. As expected, 
increased sdiA dosage led to significantly elevated sdiA and 'ddlB-ftsQAZ-lpxC 
operon expression. Transcription of two genes, uvrY and uvrC, located downstream 
of sdiA and oriented in the same direction, was elevated about 10-fold, although 
the intervening gene, yecF, of opposite polarity was unaffected by increased 
sdiA dosage. Three genes (mioC and gidAB) flanking the replication origin, oriC, 
were transcribed more often when sdiA dosage was high, as were 12 genes within 1 
min of a terminus of replication, terB. Transcription of the acrABDEF genes, 
mapping in three widely spaced loci, was elevated significantly, while several 
genes involved in DNA repair and replication (e.g., nei, recN, mioC, and mcrC) 
were moderately elevated in expression. Such global analysis provides a link 
between septation and the response to DNA-damaging agents.

The csiD-ygaF-gabDTP region in the Escherichia coli genome represents a cluster 
of sigma S-controlled genes. Here, we investigated promoter structures, sigma 
factor dependencies, potential co-regulation and environmental regulatory 
patterns for all of these genes. We find that this region constitutes a complex 
operon with expression being controlled by three differentially regulated 
promoters: (i) csiDp, which affects the expression of all five genes, is 
cAMP-CRP/sigma S-dependent and activated exclusively upon carbon starvation and 
stationary phase; (ii) gabDp1, which is sigma S-dependent and exhibits multiple 
stress induction like sigma S itself; and (iii) gabDp2[previously suggested by 
Schneider, B.L., Ruback, S., Kiupakis, A.K., Kasbarian, H., Pybus, C., and 
Reitzer, L. (2002) J. Bacteriol. 184: 6976-6986], which appears to be Nac/sigma 
70-controlled and to respond to poor nitrogen sources. In addition, we identify 
a novel repressor, CsiR, which modulates csiDp activity in a temporal manner 
during early stationary phase. Finally, we propose a physiological role for 
sigma S-controlled GabT/D-mediated gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) catabolism and 
glutamate accumulation in general stress adaptation. This physiological role is 
reflected by the activation of the operon-internal gabDp1 promoter under the 
different conditions that also induce sigma S, which include shifts to acidic pH 
or high osmolarity as well as starvation or stationary phase.

BACKGROUND: Enteric Escherichia coli survives the highly acidic environment of 
the stomach through multiple acid resistance (AR) mechanisms. The most effective 
system, AR2, decarboxylates externally-derived glutamate to remove cytoplasmic 
protons and excrete GABA. The first described system, AR1, does not require an 
external amino acid. Its mechanism has not been determined. The regulation of 
the multiple AR systems and their coordination with broader cellular metabolism 
has not been fully explored.
RESULTS: We utilized a combination of ChIP-Seq and gene expression analysis to 
experimentally map the regulatory interactions of four TFs: nac, ntrC, ompR, and 
csiR. Our data identified all previously in vivo confirmed direct interactions 
and revealed several others previously inferred from gene expression data. Our 
data demonstrate that nac and csiR directly modulate AR, and leads to a 
regulatory network model in which all four TFs participate in coordinating acid 
resistance, glutamate metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism. This model predicts a 
novel mechanism for AR1 by which the decarboxylation enzymes of AR2 are used 
with internally derived glutamate. This hypothesis makes several testable 
predictions that we confirmed experimentally.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the regulatory network underlying AR is 
complex and deeply interconnected with the regulation of GABA and glutamate 
metabolism, nitrogen metabolism. These connections underlie and experimentally 
validated model of AR1 in which the decarboxylation enzymes of AR2 are used with 
internally derived glutamate.

The DUF156 family of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators includes metal 
sensors that respond to cobalt and/or nickel (RcnR, InrS) or copper (CsoR) plus 
CstR, which responds to persulfide, and formaldehyde-responsive FrmR. 
Unexpectedly, the allosteric mechanism of FrmR from Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium is triggered by metals in vitro, and variant FrmR(E64H) gains 
responsiveness to Zn(II) and cobalt in vivo Here we establish that the 
allosteric mechanism of FrmR is triggered directly by formaldehyde in vitro 
Sensitivity to formaldehyde requires a cysteine (Cys(35) in FrmR) conserved in 
all DUF156 proteins. A crystal structure of metal- and formaldehyde-sensing 
FrmR(E64H) reveals that an FrmR-specific amino-terminal Pro(2) is proximal to 
Cys(35), and these residues form the deduced formaldehyde-sensing site. Evidence 
is presented that implies that residues spatially close to the conserved 
cysteine tune the sensitivities of DUF156 proteins above or below critical 
thresholds for different effectors, generating the semblance of specificity 
within cells. Relative to FrmR, RcnR is less responsive to formaldehyde in 
vitro, and RcnR does not sense formaldehyde in vivo, but reciprocal mutations 
FrmR(P2S) and RcnR(S2P), respectively, impair and enhance formaldehyde 
reactivity in vitro Formaldehyde detoxification by FrmA requires 
S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione, yet glutathione inhibits formaldehyde detection by 
FrmR in vivo and in vitro Quantifying the number of FrmR molecules per cell and 
modeling formaldehyde modification as a function of [formaldehyde] demonstrates 
that FrmR reactivity is optimized such that FrmR is modified and frmRA is 
derepressed at lower [formaldehyde] than required to generate 
S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione. Expression of FrmA is thereby coordinated with the 
accumulation of its substrate.

Ni(II) Sensing by RcnR Does Not Require an FrmR-Like Intersubunit Linkage.

Huang HT, Maroney MJ.

E. coli RcnR (resistance to cobalt and nickel regulator) is a homotetrameric DNA 
binding protein that regulates the expression of a Ni(II) and Co(II) exporter 
(RcnAB) by derepressing expression of rcnA and rcnB in response to binding 
Co(II) or Ni(II). Prior studies have shown that the cognate metal ions, Ni(II) 
and Co(II), bind in six-coordinate sites at subunit interfaces and are 
distinguished from noncognate metals (Cu(I), Cu(II), and Zn(II)) by coordination 
number and ligand selection. In analogy with FrmR, a formaldehyde-responsive 
transcriptional regulator in the RcnR/CsoR family, the interfacial site allows 
the metal ions to "cross-link" the N-terminal domain of one subunit with the 
invariant Cys35 residue in another, which has been deemed to be key to mediating 
the allosteric response of the tetrameric protein to metal binding. Through the 
use of mutagenesis to disconnect one subunit from the metal-mediated cross-link, 
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as a structural probe, LacZ reporter assays, 
and metal binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the work 
presented here shows that neither the interfacial binding site nor the 
coordination number of Ni(II) is important to the allosteric response to binding 
of this cognate metal ion. The opposite is found for the other cognate metal 
ion, Co(II), with respect to the interfacial binding site, suggesting that the 
molecular mechanisms for transcriptional regulation by the two ions are 
distinct. The metal binding studies reveal that tight metal binding is 
maintained in the variant. XAS is further used to demonstrate that His33 is not 
a ligand for Co(II), Ni(II), or Zn(II) in WT-RcnR. The results are discussed in 
the context of the overall understanding of the molecular mechanisms of 
metallosensors.

FrmR from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (a CsoR/RcnR-like 
transcriptional de-repressor) is shown to repress the frmRA operator-promoter, 
and repression is alleviated by formaldehyde but not manganese, iron, cobalt, 
nickel, copper, or Zn(II) within cells. In contrast, repression by a mutant 
FrmRE64H (which gains an RcnR metal ligand) is alleviated by cobalt and Zn(II). 
Unexpectedly, FrmR was found to already bind Co(II), Zn(II), and Cu(I), and 
moreover metals, as well as formaldehyde, trigger an allosteric response that 
weakens DNA affinity. However, the sensory metal sites of the cells' endogenous 
metal sensors (RcnR, ZntR, Zur, and CueR) are all tighter than FrmR for their 
cognate metals. Furthermore, the endogenous metal sensors are shown to 
out-compete FrmR. The metal-sensing FrmRE64H mutant has tighter metal affinities 
than FrmR by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Gain of cobalt sensing by 
FrmRE64H remains enigmatic because the cobalt affinity of FrmRE64H is 
substantially weaker than that of the endogenous cobalt sensor. Cobalt sensing 
requires glutathione, which may assist cobalt access, conferring a kinetic 
advantage. For Zn(II), the metal affinity of FrmRE64H approaches the metal 
affinities of cognate Zn(II) sensors. Counter-intuitively, the allosteric 
coupling free energy for Zn(II) is smaller in metal-sensing FrmRE64H compared 
with nonsensing FrmR. By determining the copies of FrmR and FrmRE64H tetramers 
per cell, then estimating promoter occupancy as a function of intracellular 
Zn(II) concentration, we show how a modest tightening of Zn(II) affinity, plus 
weakened DNA affinity of the apoprotein, conspires to make the relative 
properties of FrmRE64H (compared with ZntR and Zur) sufficient to sense Zn(II) 
inside cells.

Escherichia coli and many other bacterial species can enter into a viable but 
nonculturable (VBNC) state, which is a survival strategy adopted by cells 
exposed to adverse environmental conditions. Pyruvate is known to be one factor 
that promotes resuscitation of VBNC cells. Here we studied the role of a 
pyruvate-sensing network, composed of the histidine kinase-response regulator 
systems BtsS/BtsR and YpdA/YpdB and the target gene btsT, encoding the 
high-affinity pyruvate/H+ symporter BtsT, in the resuscitation of VBNC E. coli 
K-12 cells after exposure to cold for 120 days. Analysis of the proteome of VBNC 
cells revealed upregulation, relative to exponentially growing cells, of BtsT 
and other proteins involved in pyruvate metabolism. Provision of pyruvate 
stimulated protein and DNA biosynthesis, and thus resuscitation, in wild-type 
but not btsSR ypdAB mutant VBNC cells. This result was corroborated by 
time-dependent tracking of the resuscitation of individual VBNC E. coli cells 
observed in a microfluidic system. Finally, transport assays revealed that 
14C-labeled pyruvate was rapidly taken up into VBNC cells by BtsT. These results 
provide the first evidence that pyruvate is taken up as a carbon source for the 
resuscitation of VBNC E. coli cells.IMPORTANCE Viable but nonculturable (VBNC) 
bacteria do not form colonies in standard medium but otherwise retain their 
metabolic activity and can express toxic proteins. Many bacterial genera, 
including Escherichia, Vibrio, and Listeria, have been shown to enter the VBNC 
state upon exposure to adverse conditions, such as low temperature, radiation, 
and starvation. Ultimately, these organisms pose a public health risk with 
potential implications for the pharmaceutical and food industries, as dormant 
organisms are especially difficult to selectively eliminate and VBNC bacteria 
can be resuscitated if placed in an environment with appropriate nutrition and 
temperature. Here we used a microfluidic system to monitor the resuscitation of 
single VBNC cells over time. We provide new molecular insights into the 
initiation of resuscitation by demonstrating that VBNC E. coli cells rapidly 
take up pyruvate with an inducible high-affinity transporter, whose expression 
is triggered by the BtsSR-YpdAB sensing network.

Two-component systems (TCSs) dictate many bacterial responses to environmental 
change via the activation of a membrane-embedded sensor kinase, which has 
molecular specificity for a cognate response regulator protein. However, 
although the majority of TCSs operate through seemingly strict cognate 
protein-protein interactions, there have been several reports of TCSs that 
violate this classical model of signal transduction. Our group has recently 
demonstrated that some of these cross-interacting TCSs function in a manner that 
imparts a fitness advantage to bacterial pathogens. In this study, we describe 
interconnectivity between the metabolite-sensing TCSs YpdA/YpdB and BtsS/BtsR in 
uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The YpdA/YpdB and BtsS/BtsR TCSs have 
been previously reported to interact in K12 E. coli, where they alter the 
expression of putative transporter genes yhjX and yjiY, respectively. These 
target genes are both upregulated in UPEC during acute and chronic murine models 
of urinary tract infection, as well as in response to pyruvate and serine added 
to growth media in vitro. Here, we show that proper regulation of yhjX in UPEC 
requires the presence of all components from both of these TCSs. By utilizing 
plasmid-encoded luciferase reporters tracking the activity of the yhjX and yjiY 
promoters, we demonstrate that deletions in one TCS substantially alter 
transcriptional activity of the opposing system's target gene. However, unlike 
in K12 E. coli, single gene deletions in the YpdA/YpdB system do not alter yjiY 
gene expression in UPEC, suggesting that niche and lifestyle-specific pressures 
may be selecting for differential cross-regulation of TCSs in pathogenic and 
non-pathogenic E. coli.

The peptide transporter carbon starvation (CstA) family (transporter 
classification [TC] 2.A.114) belongs to the second largest superfamily of 
secondary transporters, the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) superfamily. 
No representative of the CstA family has previously been characterized either 
biochemically or structurally, but we have now identified the function of one of 
its members, the transport protein YjiY of Escherichia coli Expression of the 
yjiY gene is regulated by the LytS-like histidine kinase BtsS, a sensor of 
extracellular pyruvate, together with the LytTR-like response regulator BtsR. 
YjiY consists of 716 amino acids, which form 18 putative transmembrane helices. 
Transport studies with intact cells provided evidence that YjiY is a specific 
and high-affinity transporter for pyruvate (Km , 16 μM). Furthermore, 
reconstitution of the purified YjiY into proteoliposomes revealed that YjiY is a 
pyruvate/H+ symporter. It has long been assumed that E. coli possesses a 
transporter(s) for pyruvate, but the present study is the first to definitively 
identify such a protein. Based on its function, we propose to change the name of 
the uncharacterized gene yjiY to btsT for Brenztraubensäure (the German word for 
pyruvate) transporter.IMPORTANCE BtsT (formerly known as YjiY) is found in many 
commensal and pathogenic representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae This study 
for the first time characterizes a pyruvate transporter in E. coli, BtsT, as a 
specific pyruvate/H+ symporter. When nutrients are limiting, BtsT takes up 
pyruvate from the medium, thus enabling it to be used as a carbon source for the 
growth and survival of E. coli.

Fluctuating environments and individual physiological diversity force bacteria 
to constantly adapt and optimize the uptake of substrates. We focus here on two 
very similar two-component systems (TCSs) of Escherichia coli belonging to the 
LytS/LytTR family: BtsS/BtsR (formerly YehU/YehT) and YpdA/YpdB. Both TCSs 
respond to extracellular pyruvate, albeit with different affinities, typically 
during postexponential growth, and each system regulates expression of a single 
transporter gene, yjiY and yhjX, respectively. To obtain insights into the 
biological significance of these TCSs, we analyzed the activation of the target 
promoters at the single-cell level. We found unimodal cell-to-cell variability; 
however, the degree of variance was strongly influenced by the available 
nutrients and differed between the two TCSs. We hypothesized that activation of 
either of the TCSs helps individual cells to replenish carbon resources. To test 
this hypothesis, we compared wild-type cells with the btsSR ypdAB mutant under 
two metabolically modulated conditions: protein overproduction and persister 
formation. Although all wild-type cells were able to overproduce green 
fluorescent protein (GFP), about half of the btsSR ypdAB population was unable 
to overexpress GFP. Moreover, the percentage of persister cells, which tolerate 
antibiotic stress, was significantly lower in the wild-type cells than in the 
btsSR ypdAB population. Hence, we suggest that the BtsS/BtsR and YpdA/YpdB 
network contributes to a balancing of the physiological state of all cells 
within a population.IMPORTANCE Histidine kinase/response regulator (HK/RR) 
systems enable bacteria to respond to environmental and physiological 
fluctuations. Escherichia coli and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae 
possess two similar LytS/LytTR-type HK/RRs, BtsS/BtsR (formerly YehU/YehT) and 
YpdA/YpdB, which form a functional network. Both systems are activated in 
response to external pyruvate, typically when cells face overflow metabolism 
during post-exponential growth. Single-cell analysis of the activation of their 
respective target genes yjiY and yhjX revealed cell-to-cell variability, and the 
range of variation was strongly influenced by externally available nutrients. 
Based on the phenotypic characterization of a btsSR ypdAB mutant compared to the 
parental strain, we suggest that this TCS network supports an optimization of 
the physiological state of the individuals within the population.

Bacterial histidine kinase/response regulator systems operate at the interface 
between environmental cues and physiological states. Escherichia coli contains 
two LytS/LytTR-type histidine kinase/response regulator systems, BtsS/BtsR 
(formerly YehU/YehT) and YpdA/YpdB, which have been identified as 
pyruvate-responsive two-component systems. Since they exhibit remarkable 
similarity, we analyzed their phylogenetic distribution within the 
γ-proteobacteria, and experimentally characterized them in a set of 
representative species. We found that BtsS/BtsR is the predominant 
LytS/LytTR-type two-component system among γ-proteobacteria, whereas YpdA/YpdB 
primarily appears in a supplementary role. Based on our observations in E. coli, 
we used the highly conserved DNA-binding motifs to test the in vivo 
functionality of both systems in various genera, including Salmonella, 
Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Xenorhabdus, Yersinia, Aeromonas and Vibrio. The 
results suggest that, in all cases tested, BtsS/BtsR and YpdA/YpdB respond to 
different levels of pyruvate in the environment.

Two-component systems are crucial for signal perception and modulation of 
bacterial behavior. Nevertheless, to date, very few ligands have been identified 
that directly interact with histidine kinases. The histidine kinase/response 
regulator system YehU/YehT of Escherichia coli is part of a nutrient-sensing 
network. Here we demonstrate that this system senses the onset of nutrient 
limitation in amino acid rich media and responds to extracellular pyruvate. 
Binding of radiolabeled pyruvate was found for full-length YehU in 
right-side-out membrane vesicles as well as for a truncated, membrane-integrated 
variant, confirming that YehU is a high-affinity receptor for extracellular 
pyruvate. Therefore we propose to rename YehU/YehT as BtsS/BtsR, after 
"Brenztraubensäure", the name given to pyruvic acid when it was first 
synthesized. The function of BtsS/BtsR was also assessed in a clinically 
relevant uropathogenic E. coli strain. Quantitative transcriptional analysis 
revealed BtsS/BtsR importance during acute and chronic urinary-tract infections.

Regulation of nrf operon expression in pathogenic enteric bacteria: sequence 
divergence reveals new regulatory complexity.

University, Birmingham, B15 3TN, UK.

The Escherichia coli K-12 nrf operon encodes a periplasmic nitrite reductase, 
the expression of which is driven from a single promoter, pnrf. Expression from 
pnrf is activated by the FNR transcription factor in response to anaerobiosis 
and further increased in response to nitrite by the response regulator proteins, 
NarL and NarP. FNR-dependent transcription is suppressed by the binding of two 
nucleoid associated proteins, IHF and Fis. As Fis levels increase in cells grown 
in rich medium, the positioning of its binding site, overlapping the promoter 
-10 element, ensures that pnrf is sharply repressed. Here, we investigate the 
expression of the nrf operon promoter from various pathogenic enteric bacteria. 
We show that pnrf from enterohaemorrhagic E. coli is more active than its K-12 
counterpart, exhibits substantial FNR-independent activity and is insensitive to 
nutrient quality, due to an improved -10 element. We also demonstrate that the 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium core promoter is more active than 
previously thought, due to differences around the transcription start site, and 
that its expression is repressed by downstream sequences. We identify the CsrA 
RNA binding protein as being responsible for this, and show that CsrA 
differentially regulates the E. coli K-12 and Salmonella nrf operons.

Genes rcsC and rcsB form a two-component system in which rcsC encodes the sensor 
element and rcsB the regulator. In Escherichia coli, the system positively 
regulates the expression of the capsule operon, cps, and of the cell division 
gene ftsZ. We report the identification of the promoter and of the sequences 
required for rcsB-dependent stimulation of ftsZ expression. The promoter, 
ftsA1p, located in the ftsQ coding sequence, co-regulates ftsA and ftsZ. The 
sequences required for rcsB activity are immediately adjacent to this promoter.

The presumptive transcriptional regulator YjjQ has been identified as being 
virulence associated in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). In this work, 
we characterize YjjQ as transcriptional repressor of the flhDC operon, encoding 
the master regulator of flagellar synthesis, and of additional loci. The latter 
include gfc (capsule 4 synthesis), ompC (outer membrane porin C), yfiRNB 
(regulated c-di-GMP synthesis), and loci of poorly defined function (ybhL and 
ymiA-yciX). We identify the YjjQ DNA-binding sites at the flhDC and gfc 
promoters and characterize a DNA-binding sequence motif present at all promoters 
found to be repressed by YjjQ. At the flhDC promoter, the YjjQ DNA-binding site 
overlaps the RcsA-RcsB DNA-binding site. RcsA-RcsB likewise represses the flhDC 
promoter, but the repression by YjjQ and that by RcsA-RcsB are independent of 
each other. These data suggest that YjjQ is an additional regulator involved in 
the complex control of flhDC at the level of transcription initiation. 
Furthermore, we show that YjjQ represses motility of the E. coli K-12 laboratory 
strain and of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strains CFT073 and 536. Regulation of 
flhDC, yfiRNB, and additional loci by YjjQ may be features relevant for 
pathogenicity.
IMPORTANCE: Escherichia coli is a commensal and pathogenic bacterium causing 
intra- and extraintestinal infections in humans and farm animals. The 
pathogenicity of E. coli strains is determined by their particular genome 
content, which includes essential and associated virulence factors that control 
the cellular physiology in the host environment. However, the gene pools of 
commensal and pathogenic E. coli are not clearly differentiated, and the 
function of virulence-associated loci needs to be characterized. In this study, 
we characterize the function of yjjQ, encoding a transcription regulator that 
was identified as being virulence associated in avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC). 
We characterize YjjQ as transcriptional repressor of flagellar motility and of 
additional loci related to pathogenicity.

Introduction: Plantaricin BM-1 is a class IIa bacteriocin produced by 
Lactobacillus plantarum BM-1 that exerts significant antibacterial activity 
against many foodborne bacteria. Studies have shown that class IIa bacteriocins 
inhibit Gram-positive bacteria via the mannose phosphotransferase system; 
however, their mechanism of action against Gram-negative bacteria remains 
unknown. In this study, we explored the mechanism through which the Rcs 
phosphorelay affects the sensitivity of Escherichia coli K12 cells to 
plantaricin BM-1. Methods and Results: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 
plantaricin BM-1 against E. coli K12, E. coli JW5917 (rcsC mutant), E. coli 
JW2204 (rcsD mutant), and E. coli JW2205 (rcsB mutant) were 1.25, 0.59, 1.31, 
and 1.22 mg/ml, respectively. Growth curves showed that E. coli JW5917 
sensitivity to plantaricin BM-1 increased to the same level as that of E. coli 
K12 after complementation. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy and 
transmission electron microscopy revealed that, under the action of plantaricin 
BM-1, the appearance of E. coli JW5917 cells did not significantly differ from 
that of E. coli K12 cells; however, cell contents were significantly reduced and 
plasmolysis and shrinkage were observed at both ends. Crystal violet staining 
and laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that biofilm formation was 
significantly reduced after rcsC mutation, while proteomic analysis identified 
382 upregulated and 260 downregulated proteins in E. coli JW5917. In particular, 
rcsC mutation was found to affect the expression of proteins related to biofilm 
formation, with growth curve assays showing that the deletion of these proteins 
increased E. coli sensitivity to plantaricin BM-1. Discussion: Consequently, we 
speculated that the Rcs phosphorelay may regulate the sensitivity of E. coli to 
plantaricin BM-1 by affecting biofilm formation. This finding of class IIa 
bacteriocin against Gram-negative bacteria mechanism provides new insights.

Genome-wide protein-protein interaction (PPI) determination remains a 
significant unsolved problem in structural biology. The difficulty is twofold 
since high-throughput experiments (HTEs) have often a relatively high 
false-positive rate in assigning PPIs, and PPI quaternary structures are more 
difficult to solve than tertiary structures using traditional structural biology 
techniques. We proposed a uniform pipeline, Threpp, to address both problems. 
Starting from a pair of monomer sequences, Threpp first threads both sequences 
through a complex structure library, where the alignment score is combined with 
HTE data using a naïve Bayesian classifier model to predict the likelihood of 
two chains to interact with each other. Next, quaternary complex structures of 
the identified PPIs are constructed by reassembling monomeric alignments with 
dimeric threading frameworks through interface-specific structural alignments. 
The pipeline was applied to the Escherichia coli genome and created 35,125 
confident PPIs which is 4.5-fold higher than HTE alone. Graphic analyses of the 
PPI networks show a scale-free cluster size distribution, consistent with 
previous studies, which was found critical to the robustness of genome evolution 
and the centrality of functionally important proteins that are essential to E. 
coli survival. Furthermore, complex structure models were constructed for all 
predicted E. coli PPIs based on the quaternary threading alignments, where 6771 
of them were found to have a high confidence score that corresponds to the 
correct fold of the complexes with a TM-score >0.5, and 39 showed a close 
consistency with the later released experimental structures with an average 
TM-score = 0.73. These results demonstrated the significant usefulness of 
threading-based homologous modeling in both genome-wide PPI network detection 
and complex structural construction.

IgaA negatively regulates the Rcs Phosphorelay via contact with the RcsD 
Phosphotransfer Protein.

Two-component systems and phosphorelays play central roles in the ability of 
bacteria to rapidly respond to changing environments. In E. coli and related 
enterobacteria, the complex Rcs phosphorelay is a critical player in the 
bacterial response to antimicrobial peptides, beta-lactam antibiotics, and other 
disruptions at the cell surface. The Rcs system is unusual in that an inner 
membrane protein, IgaA, is essential due to its negative regulation of the 
RcsC/RcsD/RcsB phosphorelay. While it is known that IgaA transduces signals from 
the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF, how it interacts with the phosphorelay has 
remained unknown. Here we performed in vivo interaction assays and genetic 
dissection of the critical proteins and found that IgaA interacts with the 
phosphorelay protein RcsD, and that this interaction is necessary for 
regulation. Interactions between IgaA and RcsD within their respective 
periplasmic domains of these two proteins anchor repression of signaling. 
However, the signaling response depends on a second interaction between 
cytoplasmic loop 1 of IgaA and a truncated Per-Arndt-Sim (PAS-like) domain in 
RcsD. A single point mutation in the PAS-like domain increased interactions 
between the two proteins and blocked induction of the phosphorelay. IgaA may 
regulate RcsC, the histidine kinase that initiates phosphotransfer through the 
phosphorelay, indirectly, via its contacts with RcsD. Unlike RcsD, and unlike 
many other histidine kinases, the periplasmic domain of RcsC is dispensable for 
the response to signals that induce the Rcs phosphorelay system. The multiple 
contacts between IgaA and RcsD constitute a poised sensing system, preventing 
potentially toxic over-activation of this phosphorelay while enabling it to 
rapidly and quantitatively respond to signals.

Hybrid Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and uropathogenic E. coli 
(UPEC) strains of multilocus sequence type 141 (ST141) cause both urinary tract 
infections and diarrhea in humans and are phylogenetically positioned between 
STEC and UPEC strains. We used comparative genomic analysis of 85 temporally and 
spatially diverse ST141 E. coli strains, including 14 STEC/UPEC hybrids, 
collected in Germany (n = 13) and the United States (n = 1) to reconstruct their 
molecular evolution. Whole-genome sequencing data showed that 89% of the ST141 
E. coli strains either were STEC/UPEC hybrids or contained a mixture of 
virulence genes from other pathotypes. Core genome analysis and ancestral 
reconstruction revealed that the ST141 E. coli strains clustered into two 
lineages that evolved from a common ancestor in the mid-19th century. The 
STEC/UPEC hybrid emerged ∼100 years ago by acquiring an stx prophage, which 
integrated into previously unknown insertion site between rcsB and rcsD, 
followed by the insertion of a pathogenicity island (PAI) similar to PAI II of 
UPEC strain 536 (PAI II536-like). The two variants of PAI II536-like were 
associated with tRNA genes leuX and pheU, respectively. Finally, microevolution 
within PAI II536-like and acquisition of the enterohemorrhagic E. coli plasmid 
were observed. Our data suggest that intestinal pathogenic E. coli 
(IPEC)/extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) hybrids are widespread and 
that selection pressure within the ST141 E. coli population led to the emergence 
of the STEC/UPEC hybrid as a clinically important subgroup. We hypothesize that 
ST141 E. coli strains serve as a melting pot for pathogroup conversion between 
IPEC and ExPEC, contrasting the classical theory of pathogen emergence from 
nonpathogens and corroborating our recent phenomenon of heteropathogenicity 
among pathogenic E. coli strains.

Reassessing the role of the Escherichia coli CpxAR system in sensing surface 
contact.

Institute, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.

For proper biofilm formation, bacteria must have mechanisms in place to sense 
adhesion to surfaces. In Escherichia coli, the CpxAR and RcsCDB systems have 
been reported to sense surfaces. The CpxAR system is widely considered to be 
responsible for sensing attachment, specifically to hydrophobic surfaces. Here, 
using both single-cell and population-level analyses, we confirm RcsCDB 
activation upon surface contact, but find that the CpxAR system is not 
activated, in contrast to what had earlier been reported. Thus, the role of 
CpxAR in surface sensing and initiation of biofilm formation should be 
reconsidered.

RcsB, a response regulator of the FixJ/NarL family, is at the center of a 
complex network of regulatory inputs and outputs. Cell surface stress is sensed 
by an outer membrane lipoprotein, RcsF, which regulates interactions of the 
inner membrane protein IgaA, lifting negative regulation of a phosphorelay. In 
vivo evidence supports a pathway in which histidine kinase RcsC transfers 
phosphate to phosphotransfer protein RcsD, resulting in phosphorylation of RcsB. 
RcsB acts either alone or in combination with RcsA to positively regulate 
capsule synthesis and synthesis of small RNA (sRNA) RprA as well as other genes, 
and to negatively regulate motility. RcsB in combination with other FixJ/NarL 
auxiliary proteins regulates yet other functions, independent of RcsB 
phosphorylation. Proper expression of Rcs and its targets is critical for 
success of Escherichia coli commensal strains, for proper development of 
biofilm, and for virulence in some pathogens. New understanding of how the Rcs 
phosphorelay works provides insight into the flexibility of the two-component 
system paradigm.

When 10 Escherichia coli mutant strains with defects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
core biosynthesis were grown on agar medium at 30°C, four of them, the ΔwaaF, 
ΔwaaG, ΔwaaP, and ΔwaaB strains, formed mucoid colonies, while the other six, 
the ΔwaaU, ΔwaaR, ΔwaaO, ΔwaaC, ΔwaaQ, and ΔwaaY strains, did not. Using light 
microscopy with tannin mordant staining, the presence of exopolysaccharide 
around the cells of the mutants that formed mucoid colonies could be discerned. 
The ΔwaaF mutant produced the largest amounts of exopolysaccharide, regardless 
of whether it was grown on agar or in liquid medium. The exopolysaccharide was 
isolated from the liquid growth medium of ΔwaaF cells, hydrolyzed, and analyzed 
by high-performance liquid chromatography with an ion-exchange column, and the 
results indicated that the exopolysaccharide was consistent with colanic acid. 
When the key genes related to the biosynthesis of colanic acid, i.e., wza, wzb, 
wzc, and wcaA, were deleted in the ΔwaaF background, the exopolysaccharide could 
not be produced any more, further confirming that it was colanic acid. Colanic 
acid could not be produced in strains in which rcsA, rcsB, rcsD, or rcsF was 
deleted in the ΔwaaF background, but a reduced level of colanic acid production 
was detected when the rcsC gene was deleted, suggesting that a change of 
lipopolysaccharide structure in ΔwaaF cells might be sensed by the RcsCDB 
phosphorelay system, leading to the production of colanic acid. The results 
demonstrate that E. coli cells can activate colanic acid production through the 
RcsCDB phosphorelay system in response to a structural deficiency of 
lipopolysaccharide.
IMPORTANCE: Lipopolysaccharide and colanic acid are important forms of 
exopolysaccharide for Escherichia coli cells. Their metabolism and biological 
significance have been investigated, but their interrelation with the cell 
stress response process is not understood. This study demonstrates, for the 
first time, that E. coli cells can activate colanic acid production through the 
RcsCDB phosphorelay system in response to a structural change of 
lipopolysaccharide, suggesting that bacterial cells can monitor the outer 
membrane integrity, which is essential for cell survival and damage repair.

RcsC is a hybrid histidine kinase that forms part of a phospho-relay signal 
transduction pathway with RcsD and RcsB. Besides the typical domains of a sensor 
kinase, i.e. the periplasmic (P), linker (L), dimerization and H-containing (A), 
and ATP-binding (B) domains, RcsC possesses a receiver domain (D) at the 
carboxy-terminal domain. To study the role played by each of the RcsC domains, 
four plasmids containing several of these domains were constructed (PLAB, LAB, 
AB and ABD) and transformed into Escherichia coli K-12 strain BW25113. Different 
amounts of biofilm were produced, depending on the RcsC domains expressed: the 
plasmid expressing the ABD subdomains produced the highest amount of biofilm. 
This phenotype was also observed when the plasmids were transformed in a ΔrcsCDB 
strain. Biofilm formation was abolished in the pgaABCD and nhaR backgrounds. The 
results indicate the existence of a novel signalling pathway that depends on 
RcsC, yet independent of RcsD and RcsB, that activates the pgaABCD operon and, 
as a consequence, biofilm formation. This signalling pathway involves the 
secondary metabolite acetyl phosphate and the response regulator OmpR.

The Rcs phosphorelay pathway is a complex signaling pathway involved in the 
regulation of many cell surface structures in enteric bacteria. In response to 
environmental stimuli, the sensor histidine kinase (RcsC) autophosphorylates and 
then transfers the phosphate through intermediary steps to the response 
regulator (RcsB), which, once phosphorylated, regulates gene expression. Here, 
we show that Salmonella biofilm development depends on the phosphorylation 
status of RcsB. Thus, unphosphorylated RcsB, hitherto assumed to be inactive, is 
essential to activate the expression of the biofilm matrix compounds. The 
prevention of RcsB phosphorylation either by the disruption of the phosphorelay 
at the RcsC or RcsD level or by the production of a nonphosphorylatable RcsB 
allele induces biofilm development. On the contrary, the phosphorylation of RcsB 
by the constitutive activation of the Rcs pathway inhibits biofilm development, 
an effect that can be counteracted by the introduction of a nonphosphorylatable 
RcsB allele. The inhibition of biofilm development by phosphorylated RcsB is due 
to the repression of CsgD expression, through a mechanism dependent on the 
accumulation of the small noncoding RNA RprA. Our results indicate that 
unphosphorylated RcsB plays an active role for integrating environmental signals 
and, more broadly, that RcsB phosphorylation acts as a key switch between 
planktonic and sessile life-styles in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.

Escherichia coli.

The common colonization factor of Escherichia coli, the Mat (also termed ECP) 
fimbria, functions to advance biofilm formation on inert surfaces as well as 
bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and subsequent colonization. We used 
global mini-Tn5 transposon mutagenesis to identify novel regulators of biofilm 
formation by the meningitic E. coli isolate IHE 3034. Of the 4,418 
transformants, we found 17 that were impaired in biofilm formation. Most of 
these mutants were affected in lipopolysaccharide synthesis and were reduced in 
growth but not in Mat fimbria expression. In contrast, two mutants grew well but 
did not express Mat fimbria. The insertions in these two mutants were located at 
different sites of the rcsB gene, which encodes a DNA-binding response regulator 
of the Rcs response regulon. The mutations abrogated temperature-dependent 
biofilm formation by IHE 3034, and the phenotype correlated with loss of mat 
expression. The defect in biofilm formation in the rcsB mutant was reversed upon 
complementation with rcsB as well as by overexpression of structural mat genes 
but not by overexpression of the fimbria-specific activator gene matA. 
Monitoring of the mat operon promoter activity with chromosomal reporter fusions 
showed that the RcsB protein and an RcsAB box in the mat regulatory region, but 
not RcsC, RcsD, AckA, and Pta, are essential for initiation of mat 
transcription. Gel retardation assays showed that RcsB specifically binds to the 
mat promoter DNA, which enables its function in promoting biofilm formation by 
E. coli.

AtoSC two-component system (TCS) upregulates the high-molecular weight 
poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) biosynthesis in recombinant phaCAB (+) 
Escherichia coli strains, with the Cupriavidus necator phaCAB operon. We report 
here that AtoSC upregulates also the copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) biosynthesis in 
phaCAB (+) E. coli. Acetoacetate-induced AtoSC maximized P(3HB-co-3HV) to 
1.27 g/l with a 3HV fraction of 25.5 % wt. and biopolymer content of 75 % w/w in 
a time-dependent process. The atoSC locus deletion in the ∆atoSC strains 
resulted in 4.5-fold P(3HB-co-3HV) reduction, while the 3HV fraction of the 
copolymer was restricted to only 6.4 % wt. The ∆atoSC phenotype was restored by 
extrachromosomal introduction of AtoSC. Deletion of the atoDAEB operon triggered 
a significant decrease in P(3HB-co-3HV) synthesis and 3HV content in ∆atoDAEB 
strains. However, the acetoacetate-induced AtoSC in those strains increased 
P(3HB-co-3HV) to 0.8 g/l with 21 % 3HV, while AtoC or AtoS expression increased 
P(3HB-co-3HV) synthesis 3.6- or 2.4-fold, respectively, upon acetoacetate. 
Complementation of the ∆atoDAEB phenotype was achieved by the extrachromosomal 
introduction of the atoSCDAEB regulon. Individual inhibition of β-oxidation and 
mainly fatty acid biosynthesis pathways by acrylic acid or cerulenin, 
respectively, reduced P(3HB-co-3HV) biosynthesis. Under those conditions, 
introduction of atoSC or atoSCDAEB regulon was capable of upregulating 
biopolymer accumulation. Concurrent inhibition of both the fatty acid metabolic 
pathways eliminated P(3HB-co-3HV) production. P(3HB-co-3HV) upregulation in 
phaCAB (+) E. coli by AtoSC signaling through atoDAEB operon and its 
participation in the fatty acids metabolism interplay provide additional 
perceptions of AtoSC critical involvement in E. coli regulatory processes 
towards biotechnologically improved polyhydroxyalkanoates biosynthesis.

system in Escherichia coli.

Verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine are Ca(2+)-channel blockers used in 
cardiovascular diseases. We report here that the Escherichia coli AtoSC 
signaling is inhibited by those blockers. AtoSC two-component system plays a 
pivotal role in sophisticated signaling networks in E. coli regulating processes 
implicated in bacterial homeostasis and pathogenicity. The Ca(2+)-channel 
blockers abrogated the in vitro full-length AtoS kinase autophosphorylation. 
However, they demonstrated no effect on the AtoS cytoplasmic form 
autophosphorylation. AtoC protected AtoS from verapamil or diltiazem but not 
from nifedipine, when the two constituents formed complex. The blockers did not 
affect the AtoS≈P to AtoC phosphotransfer. The blockers-mediated AtoSC 
inhibition was verified in vivo on the atoDAEB expression, which was inhibited 
only in AtoSC-expressing bacteria upon acetoacetate. The AtoS and AtoC protein 
or their genes transcription levels were unaffected by the blockers. Blockers 
demonstrated differential effects in the regulation of both the cytosolic- and 
most potently the membrane-bound-cPHB. Extracellular Ca(2+) counteracted the 
verapamil-mediated effect on cPHB only in atoSC(+) cells. Extracellular Ca(2+) 
reversed the diltiazem-mediated cPHB decreases in cells of both genetic 
backgrounds, yet a Ca(2+)-concentration dependent reversion was observed only in 
the AtoSC-regulated cPHB. Nifedipine caused a more pronounced cPHB 
down-regulation that was not reversed by extracellular Ca(2+). The AtoSC 
signaling inhibition by Ca(2+)-channel blockers used for human treatment, and 
their differential effects on cPHB-formed Ca(2+)-channels, signify their 
implications in bacterial-host interactions through the two-component signaling 
and could stimulate the design of Ca(2+)-channels blockers derivatives acting as 
inhibitors of two-component systems.

AtoSC two-component system plays a pivotal role in many regulatory indispensable 
Escherichia coli processes. AtoSCDAEB regulon, comprising the AtoSC system and 
the atoDAEB operon, regulates the short-chain fatty acids catabolism. We report 
here, that AtoSC up-regulates the high-molecular weight PHB biosynthesis, in 
recombinant phaCAB(+)E. coli, with the Cupriavidus necator phaCAB operon. PHB 
accumulation was maximized upon the acetoacetate-mediated induction of AtoSC, 
under glucose 1% w/v, resulting in a yield of 1.73 g/l with a biopolymer content 
of 64.5% w/w. The deletion of the atoSC locus, in the ΔatoSC strains, resulted 
in a 5 fold reduction of PHB accumulation, which was restored by the 
extrachromosomal introduction of the AtoSC system. The deletion of the atoDAEB 
operon triggered a significant decrease in PHB synthesis in ΔatoDAEB strains. 
However, the acetoacetate-induced AtoSC system in those strains increased PHB to 
1.55 g/l, while AtoC expression increased PHB to 1.4 g/l upon acetoacetate. The 
complementation of the ΔatoDAEB phenotype was achieved by the extrachromosomal 
introduction of the atoSCDAEB regulon. The individual inhibition of β-oxidation 
and mainly fatty-acid biosynthesis pathways by acrylic acid or cerulenin 
respectively, reduced PHB biosynthesis. Under those conditions the introduction 
of the atoSC locus or the atoSCDAEB regulon was capable to up-regulate the 
biopolymer accumulation. The concurrent inhibition of both the fatty acids 
metabolic pathways eliminated PHB production. PHB up-regulation in phaCAB(+)E. 
coli, by AtoSC signaling through atoDAEB operon and its participation in the 
fatty acids metabolism interplay, provide additional perceptions of AtoSC 
critical involvement in E. coli regulatory processes towards the 
biotechnologically improved polyhydroxyalkanoates biosynthesis.

The AtoSC two-component system in Escherichia coli is a key regulator of many 
physiological processes. We report here the contribution of AtoSC in E. coli 
motility and chemotaxis. AtoSC locus deletion in ΔatoSC cells renders cells not 
motile or responsive against any chemoattractant or repellent independently of 
the AtoSC inducer's presence. AtoSC expression through plasmid complemented the 
ΔatoSC phenotype. Cells expressing either AtoS or AtoC demonstrated analogous 
motility and chemotactic phenotypes as ΔatoSC cells, independently of AtoSC 
inducer's presence. Mutations of AtoC phosphate-acceptor sites diminished or 
abrogated E. coli chemotaxis. trAtoC, the AtoC constitutive active form which 
lacks its receiver domain, up-regulated E. coli motility. AtoSC enhanced the 
transcription of the flhDC and fliAZY operons and to a lesser extent of the 
flgBCDEFGHIJKL operon. The AtoSC-mediated regulation of motility and chemotactic 
response required also the expression of the CheAY system. The AtoSC inducers 
enhanced the AtoSC-mediated motility and chemotaxis. Acetoacetate or spermidine 
further promoted the responses of only AtoSC-expressing cells, while Ca(2+) 
demonstrated its effects independently of AtoSC. Histamine regulated bacterial 
chemotaxis only in atoSC (+) cells in a concentration-dependent manner while 
reversed the AtoSC-mediated effects when added at high concentrations. The 
trAtoC-controlled motility effects were enhanced by acetoacetate or spermidine, 
but not by histamine. These data reveal that AtoSC system regulates the motility 
and chemotaxis of E. coli, participating in the transcriptional induction of the 
main promoters of the chemotactic regulon and modifying the motility and 
chemotactic phenotypes in an induction-dependent mechanism.

The Escherichia coli AtoSC two component system;upon acetoacetate 
induction;regulates the expression of the atoDAEB operon;through His→Asp 
phopshotransfer;thus modulating important cellular processes. In this report the 
effect of seven 5,7,8-trimethyl-1,4-benzoxazine derivatives on the regulation of 
the E. coli AtoSC system was studied. The new compounds were tested for their 
effectiveness on the expression of the atoC and the regulated atoDAEB operon. 
The non-substituted 5,7,8-trimethyl-1,4-benzoxazine (4a), was the most potent 
inducer on atoC transcription;resulting in accumulation of AtoC protein. The 
induction of atoC by 4a was specific;since no effect was observed on the other 
genes of the system (atoS and atoDAEB). Moreover;compound 4a was shown to 
significantly up-regulate the in vitro kinase activity of the histidine kinase 
AtoS without altering the protein levels in the cell. Interestingly;this 
compound appeared to modulate the acetoacetate-mediated induction of the atoDAEB 
promoter by the AtoSC system. These data provide the first evidence for a 
differential modulator role of 5,7,8-trimethyl-1,4-benzoxazine;on the AtoSC two 
component system mediated signaling.

Inhibition of the signal transduction through the AtoSC system by histidine

Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GR-54124, Greece. evatheod@physics.auth.gr

AtoSC two-component system participates in many indispensable processes of 
Escherichia coli. We report here that the AtoSC signal transduction is inhibited 
by established histidine kinase inhibitors. Closantel, RWJ-49815 and TNP-ATP 
belonging to different chemical classes of inhibitors, abrogated the in vitro 
AtoS kinase autophosphorylation. However, when AtoS was embedded in the membrane 
fractions, higher inhibitor concentrations were required for total inhibition. 
When AtoS interacted with AtoC forming complex, the intrinsic histidine kinase 
was protected by the response regulator, requiring increased inhibitors 
concentrations for partially AtoS autophosphorylation reduction. The inhibitors 
exerted an additional function on AtoSC, blocking the phosphotransfer from AtoS 
to AtoC, without however, affecting AtoC~P dephosphorylation. Their in vivo 
consequences through the AtoSC inhibition were elucidated on atoDAEB operon 
expression, which was inhibited only in AtoSC-expressing bacteria where AtoSC 
was induced by acetoacetate or spermidine. The inhibitor effects were extended 
on the AtoSC regulatory role on cPHB [complexed poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] 
biosynthesis. cPHB was decreased upon the blockers only in acetoacetate-induced 
AtoSC-expressing cells. Increased ATP amounts during bacterial growth reversed 
the inhibitory TNP-ATP-mediated effect on cPHB. The alteration of pivotal E. 
coli processes as an outcome of AtoSC inhibition, establish this system as a 
target of two-component systems inhibitors.

AtoSC two-component system is involved in cPHB biosynthesis through fatty acid 
metabolism in E. coli.

Author information:
(1)Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, 
Greece.

BACKGROUND: We have shown previously that AtoSC two-component system regulates 
the biosynthesis of E. coli cPHB [complexed poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate].
METHODS: The AtoSC involvement on fatty acids metabolism, towards cPHB 
synthesis, was studied using cPHB determination, gene expression, and fatty acid 
metabolic pathways inhibitors.
RESULTS: Deletion of the atoDAEB operon from the E. coli genome resulted in a 
consistent reduction of cPHB accumulation. When in ΔatoDAEB cells, the atoDAEB 
operon and the AtoSC system were introduced extrachromosomally, a significant 
enhancement of cPHB levels was observed. Moreover, the introduction of a plasmid 
with atoSC genes regulated positively cPHB biosynthesis. A lesser cPHB 
enhancement was triggered when plasmids carrying either atoS or atoC were 
introduced. The intracellular distribution of cPHB was regulated by AtoSC or 
AtoC according to the inducer (acetoacetate or spermidine). Blockage of 
β-oxidation by acrylic acid reduced cPHB levels, suggesting the involvement of 
this pathway in cPHB synthesis; however, the overproduction of AtoSC or its 
constituents separately resulted in cPHB enhancement. Inhibition of fatty acid 
biosynthesis by cerulenin resulted to a major cPHB reduction, indicating the 
contribution of this pathway in cPHB production. Inhibition of both β-oxidation 
and fatty acid biosynthesis reduced dramatically cPHB, suggesting the 
contribution of both pathways in cPHB biosynthesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Short fatty acid catabolism (atoDAEB operon) and fatty acids 
metabolic pathways participate in cPHB synthesis through the involvement of 
AtoSC system.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The involvement of the AtoSC system in the fatty acids 
metabolic pathways interplay towards cPHB biosynthesis provides additional 
perceptions of AtoSC role on E. coli regulatory biochemical processes.

Bacterial signal transduction systems can be viewed as an entity of 
multi-sensory and output domains, whereas the functions of response regulators 
play a pivotal role in the complex network interactions. One crucial property 
among response regulators functions is their oligomerization and subsequent 
binding to DNA. The AtoS-AtoC two component system, functionally modulated by 
various agents, influences fundamental cellular processes such as short-chain 
fatty acid catabolism and poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate biosynthesis in Escherichia 
coli. Among the already reported characteristic properties, AtoC binds to a 
specific site, a palindromic repeat of 20 nucleotides within the atoDAEB 
promoter. Since experimental structures of AtoC or its complex with DNA are not 
yet available, an almost complete homology model of AtoC and of its putative 
entity as a dimer is constructed for this study, as well as a model of its 
binding to its target DNA sequence. The latter is associated with large 
conformational changes, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequent 
biochemical study, including cross-linking via chemical agents, revealed the 
ability of AtoC to form oligomers in vitro.

The AtoSC two-component system in E. coli consists of the AtoS sensor kinase and 
the AtoC response regulator. It regulates positively the transcriptional 
activation of atoDAEB operon, encoding enzymes involved in short-chain fatty 
acid catabolism upon acetoacetate-mediated induction. AtoSC acting on atoDAEB 
operon, regulates the biosynthesis and the intracellular distribution of 
short-chain poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (cPHB). A phosphorylation-incompetent 
AtoC form was constructed lacking its N-terminal receiver domain, trAtoC, to 
study the effects of AtoC domains on cPHB biosynthesis and atoDAEB operon 
regulation. Both cPHB biosynthesis and atoDAEB gene expression were regulated 
positively by trAtoC in the absence of any inducer in E. coli of both atoSC (+) 
and ΔatoSC genotypes. The presence of acetoacetate or spermidine further 
promoted these trAtoC actions. Competitive regulatory functions between the full 
length AtoC and trAtoC were observed referring to atoDAEB and cPHB targets as 
well as growth of trAtoC-overproducing atoSC (+) cells on butyrate as the sole 
carbon source. trAtoC in contrast to the wild-type AtoC presented different 
modes of cPHB and atoDAEB regulation in the presence of compounds involved in 
fatty acid metabolism including CoA-SH, acetyl-CoA, sodium acetate or 
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. These data provide evidence for a role of the AtoC 
N-terminal receiver domain in regulating the biological activities of AtoSC as 
well as additional mechanisms of interactions between the AtoSC constituents 
including their established inducers or new effectors towards the accomplishment 
of the AtoSC TCS signal transduction.

Signal transduction and adaptive regulation through bacterial two-component 
systems: the Escherichia coli AtoSC paradigm.

Adaptive signal transduction within microbial cells involves a multi-faceted 
regulated phosphotransfer mechanism that comprises structural rearrangements of 
sensor histidine kinases upon ligand-binding and phosphorylation-induced 
conformational changes in response regulators of versatile two-component systems 
(TCS), arisen early in bacterial evolution. In Escherichia coli, cross-talk 
between the AtoS histidine kinase and the AtoC response regulator, forming the 
AtoSC TCS, through His --> Asp phosphotransfer, activates AtoC directly to 
induce atoDAEB operon expression, thus modulating diverse fundamental cellular 
processes such as short-chain fatty acid catabolism, poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate 
biosynthesis and chemotaxis. Among the inducers hitherto identified, 
acetoacetate is the classical activator. The AtoSC TCS functional modulation by 
polyamines, histamine and Ca(2+), as well as the role of AtoC as transcriptional 
regulator, add new promising perspectives in the physiological significance and 
potential pharmacological exploitation of this TCS in cell proliferation, 
bacteria-host interactions, chemotaxis, and adaptation.

Identification and characterization of genes (xapA, xapB, and xapR) involved in 
xanthosine catabolism in Escherichia coli.

We have characterized four genes from the 52-min region on the Escherichia coli 
linkage map. Three of these genes are directly involved in the metabolism of 
xanthosine, whereas the function of the fourth gene is unknown. One of the genes 
(xapA) encodes xanthosine phosphorylase. The second gene, named xapB, encodes a 
polypeptide that shows strong similarity to the nucleoside transport protein 
NupG. The genes xapA and xapB are located clockwise of a gene identified as 
xapR, which encodes a positive regulator belonging to the LysR family and is 
required for the expression of xapA and xapB. The genes xapA and xapB form an 
operon, and their expression was strictly dependent on the presence of both the 
XapR protein and the inducer xanthosine. Expression of the xapR gene is 
constitutive and not autoregulated, unlike the case for many other LysR family 
proteins. In minicells, the XapB polypeptide was found primarily in the membrane 
fraction, indicating that XapB is a transport protein like NupG and is involved 
in the transport of xanthosine.

Cobalt can be toxic and the way cells adapt to its presence is largely unknown. 
Here we carried out a transcriptomic analysis of Escherichia coli exposed to 
cobalt. A limited number of genes were either up- or downregulated. Upregulated 
genes include the isc and the nfuA genes encoding Fe/S biogenesis assisting 
factors, and the rcnA gene encoding a cobalt efflux system. Downregulated genes 
are implicated in anaerobic metabolism (narK, nirB, hybO, grcA), metal transport 
(feoB, nikA), sulfate/thiosulfate import (cysP), and one is of unknown function 
(yeeE). Cobalt regulation of isc, nfuA, hybO, cysP and yeeE genes was found to 
involve IscR, a Fe/S transcriptional regulator. Previously, the Suf Fe/S 
biogenesis machinery was found to be important for cobalt stress adaptation, but 
suf genes did not show up in the microarray analysis. Therefore, we used qRT-PCR 
analysis and found that cobalt induced the suf operon expression. Moreover, 
kinetic analysis of the cobalt-mediated induction of the suf operon expression 
allowed us to propose that cobalt toxicity is caused first by impaired Fe/S 
biogenesis, followed by decreased iron bioavailability and eventually oxidative 
stress.

Fe-S clusters are essential across the biological world, yet how cells regulate 
expression of Fe-S cluster biogenesis pathways to cope with changes in Fe-S 
cluster demand is not well understood. Here, we describe the mechanism by which 
IscR, a [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing regulator of Escherichia coli, adjusts the 
synthesis of the Isc Fe-S biogenesis pathway to maintain Fe-S homeostasis. Our 
data indicate that a negative feedback loop operates to repress transcription of 
the iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx operon, encoding IscR and the Isc machinery, through 
binding of [2Fe-2S]-IscR to two upstream binding sites. IscR was shown to 
require primarily the Isc pathway for synthesis of its Fe-S cluster, providing a 
link between IscR activity and demands for Fe-S clusters through the levels of 
the Isc system. Surprisingly, the isc operon was more repressed under anaerobic 
conditions, indicating increased Fe-S cluster occupancy of IscR and decreased 
Fe-S cluster biogenesis demand relative to aerobic conditions. Consistent with 
this notion, overexpression of a Fe-S protein under aerobic conditions, but not 
under anaerobic conditions, led to derepression of P(iscR). Together, these data 
show how transcriptional control of iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx by [2Fe-2S]-IscR allows 
E. coli to respond efficiently to varying Fe-S demands.

IscS plays a principal role in the synthesis of sulfur-containing biomolecules. 
It is known that the expression of iscS can be negatively regulated by IscR, the 
first gene product of iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx. What governs the regulation of cysteine 
desulfurase activity, however, is unknown. Here, we report that IscS from 
Escherichia coli is able to bind iron with an association constant of 
1.6x10(17)M(-1) to form an IscS-iron complex. IscS is also capable of binding 
both iron and sulfide to form an IscS-iron-sulfide complex with a higher 
affinity. The desulfurase activity is gradually inhibited as the amount of iron 
and sulfide bound to IscS increases. When 2Fe-2S binds IscS, about 20% of the 
activity is inhibited; when 8Fe-8S adheres to IscS, about 70% of the activity is 
inhibited. Thus, the cell is able to modulate its desulfurase activity with the 
formation of an IscS-iron-sulfide complex.

IscR is an iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster-containing transcription factor that 
represses transcription of the operon containing its own gene and the 
iscSUA-hscBA-fdx genes, whose products are involved in Fe-S cluster biogenesis. 
In this study, global transcriptional profiling of Escherichia coli IscR(+) and 
IscR(-) strains grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions indicated that 40 
genes in 20 predicted operons were regulated by IscR. DNase I footprinting 
and/or in vitro transcription reactions identified seven new promoters under 
direct IscR control. Among these were genes encoding known or proposed functions 
in Fe-S cluster biogenesis (sufABCDSE, yadR and yhgI) and Fe-S 
cluster-containing anaerobic respiratory enzymes (hyaABCDEF, hybOABCDEFG and 
napFDAGHBC). The finding that IscR repressed expression of the hyaA, hybO and 
napF promoters specifically under aerobic growth conditions suggests a new 
mechanism to explain their upregulation under anaerobic growth conditions. 
Phylogenetic footprinting of the DNase I protected regions of seven promoters 
implies that there are at least two different classes of IscR binding sites 
conserved among many bacteria. The findings presented here indicate a more 
general role of IscR in the regulation of Fe-S cluster biogenesis and that IscR 
contributes to the O(2) regulation of several promoters controlling the 
expression of anaerobic Fe-S proteins.

Interchangeability and distinct properties of bacterial Fe-S cluster assembly 
systems: functional replacement of the isc and suf operons in Escherichia coli 
with the nifSU-like operon from Helicobacter pylori.

The assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, a key step in the 
post-translational maturation of Fe-S proteins, is mediated by a complex 
apparatus. In E. coli, this process involves two independent systems called ISC 
and SUF encoded by the iscSUA-hscBA-fdx gene cluster and sufABCDSE operon, 
respectively. Another system, termed NIF (nifSU), is required for the maturation 
of nitrogenase in nitrogen-fixing bacteria. We have developed a novel genetic 
system to gain further insight into these multi-component systems, and to 
determine how ISC, SUF and NIF might differ in their roles in Fe-S assembly. We 
have constructed an E. coli mutant lacking both the isc and suf operons, and 
this strain can only survive in the presence of a complementing plasmid. Using 
the plasmid replacement technique, we examined the isc and suf operons, and 
identified the genes essential for the function. Additionally, we have found 
that nifSU-like genes cloned from Helicobacter pylori are functionally 
exchangeable with the isc and suf operons. Thus, the NIF-like system 
participates in the maturation of a wide variety of Fe-S proteins. An increased 
ability of NIF to complement isc and suf loss was seen under anaerobic 
conditions. This may explain why the NIF system is only found in a limited 
number of bacterial species, and most other organisms prefer the ISC and/or SUF 
systems. While the differences between ISC and SUF were small with respect to 
the complementing activity, the SUF system appears to be more advantageous for 
bacterial growth in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.

The iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, the nonheme-iron cofactor essential for the 
activity of many proteins, is incorporated into target proteins with the aid of 
complex machinery. In bacteria, several proteins encoded by the 
iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx-ORF3 cluster (isc operon) have been proposed to execute 
crucial tasks in the assembly of Fe-S clusters. To elucidate the in vivo 
function, we have undertaken a systematic mutational analysis of the genes in 
the Escherichia coli isc operon. In all functional tests, i.e. growth rate, 
nutritional requirements and activities of Fe-S enzymes, the inactivation of the 
iscS gene elicited the most drastic alteration. Strains with mutations in the 
iscU, hscB, hscA, and fdx genes also exhibited conspicuous phenotypical 
consequences almost identical to one another. The effect of the inactivation of 
iscA was small but appreciable on Fe-S enzymes. In contrast, mutants with 
inactivated iscR or ORF3 showed virtually no differences from wild-type cells. 
The requirement of iscSUA-hscBA-fdx for the assembly of Fe-S clusters was 
further confirmed by complementation experiments using a mutant strain in which 
the entire isc operon was deleted. Our findings support the conclusion that 
IscS, via cysteine desulfurase activity, provides the sulfur that is 
subsequently incorporated into Fe-S clusters by assembler machinery comprising 
of the iscUA-hscBA-fdx gene products. The results presented here indicate 
crucial roles for IscU, HscB, HscA, and Fdx as central components of the 
assembler machinery and also provide evidence for interactions among them.

    Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Dec 18;98(26):14751-3.

IscR (iron-sulfur cluster regulator) is encoded by an ORF located immediately 
upstream of genes coding for the Escherichia coli Fe-S cluster assembly 
proteins, IscS, IscU, and IscA. IscR shares amino acid similarity with MarA, a 
member of the MarA/SoxS/Rob family of transcription factors. In this study, we 
found that IscR functions as a repressor of the iscRSUA operon, because strains 
deleted for iscR have increased expression of this operon. In addition, in vitro 
transcription reactions established a direct role for IscR in repression of the 
iscR promoter. Analysis of IscR by electron paramagnetic resonance showed that 
the anaerobically isolated protein contains a [2Fe-2S](1+) cluster. The Fe-S 
cluster appears to be important for IscR function, because repression of iscR 
expression is significantly reduced in strains containing null mutations of the 
Fe-S cluster assembly genes iscS or hscA. The finding that IscR activity is 
decreased in strain backgrounds in which Fe-S cluster assembly is impaired 
suggests that this protein may be part of a novel autoregulatory mechanism that 
senses the Fe-S cluster assembly status of cells.

CsrA of Escherichia coli is an RNA-binding protein that globally regulates a 
wide variety of cellular processes and behaviors, including carbon metabolism, 
motility, biofilm formation, and the stringent response. CsrB and CsrC are small 
RNAs (sRNAs) that sequester CsrA, thereby preventing CsrA-mRNA interaction. RpoE 
(σE) is the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor of E. coli Previous 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies identified rpoE mRNA as a CsrA target. Here, we 
explored the regulation of rpoE by CsrA and found that CsrA represses rpoE 
translation. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified 
three CsrA binding sites in the rpoE leader transcript, one of which overlaps 
the rpoE Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, while another overlaps the rpoE 
translation initiation codon. Coupled in vitro transcription-translation 
experiments showed that CsrA represses rpoE translation by binding to these 
sites. We further demonstrate that σE indirectly activates the transcription of 
csrB and csrC, leading to increased sequestration of CsrA, such that repression 
of rpoE by CsrA is reduced. We propose that the Csr system fine-tunes the 
σE-dependent cell envelope stress response. We also identified a 51-amino-acid 
coding sequence whose stop codon overlaps the rpoE start codon and demonstrate 
that rpoE is translationally coupled with this upstream open reading frame 
(ORF51). The loss of coupling reduces rpoE translation by more than 50%. 
Identification of a translationally coupled ORF upstream of rpoE suggests that 
this previously unannotated protein may participate in the cell envelope stress 
response. In keeping with existing nomenclature, we named ORF51 rseD, resulting 
in an operon arrangement of rseD-rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC IMPORTANCE CsrA 
posttranscriptionally represses genes required for bacterial stress responses, 
including the stringent response, catabolite repression, and the RpoS 
(σS)-mediated general stress response. We show that CsrA represses the 
translation of rpoE, encoding the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor, 
and that σE indirectly activates the transcription of csrB and csrC, resulting 
in reciprocal regulation of these two global regulatory systems. These findings 
suggest that extracytoplasmic stress leads to derepression of rpoE translation 
by CsrA, and CsrA-mediated repression helps reset RpoE abundance to prestress 
levels once envelope damage is repaired. The discovery of an ORF, rseD, 
translationally coupled with rpoE adds further complexity to translational 
control of rpoE.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

To understand the mechanism of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis, we examined the 
consequences of deletion derivatives of rpoE regulators rseA, rseB and rseC on 
sigma(E) transcription, on levels of free versus membrane-bound sigma(E) and on 
OMP-biogenesis limiting factor(s) that could impact cell lysis. RT-PCR showed 
that individual nonpolar DeltarseA and DeltarseB increased the rpoE expression 
to varying extents, with pronounced induction in DeltarseA. Significantly the 
ratio of soluble (free) versus membrane-bound form of RpoE increased in 
DeltarseA, however without increase of its total amount, unraveling furthermore 
complexity in RpoE regulation. Significant characteristics of cell lysis, 
accompanied by a severe reduction in the levels of periplasmic OMP-folding 
factor (PpiD), were observed in DeltarseA. The cell-lysis phenotype of DeltarseA 
was suppressed by either rseA or ppiD plasmids, but neither by rseB nor by rseC 
clones. However, the cell lysis of the wild-type strain was almost completely 
repressed not only by the rseA clone but also by the rseB clone, suggesting RseB 
might be limiting in vivo. Thus, increase in the ratio of free sigma(E) in rseA 
mutants with a concomitant reduction in PpiD levels can account for 
sigma(E)-dependent lysis in concert with a potential role of small RNAs on the 
lysis process.

The rpoE gene encoding an RNA polymerase sigmaE subunit was isolated from a 
gamma-phage library of the deep-sea piezophilic and psychrophilic bacterium 
Shewanella violacea strain DSS12. Structual analysis showed that the gene 
organization of the fragment containing S. violacearpoE was the l-aspartate 
oxidase-coding gene, rpoE, rseA, rseB and rseC in that order, the same as in the 
case of Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Escherichia coli K-12. The cloned gene, 
576 bp in length, was found to encode a protein consisting of 192 amino acid 
residues with a molecular mass of 21,806 Da. Amino acid alignment of the RpoE 
protein showed that the functional domains responsible for DNA recognition, DNA 
melting, core binding, and RseA interaction were highly conserved. We purified 
hexahistidine-fused RpoE protein by constructing an overexpression plasmid. 
Core-binding analysis revealed that the cloned RpoE protein has the ability to 
bind with core RNA polymerase as a sigma factor.

The sigmaE-mediated response to extracytoplasmic stress in Escherichia coli is

The extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli is controlled by the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma(E). sigma(E) activity is uniquely induced by the 
accumulation of outer membrane protein precursors in the periplasmic space, and 
leads to the increased production of several proteins, including the periplasmic 
protease DegP, that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular 
integrity under stress conditions. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that 
sigma(E) activity is under the control of three genes, rseABC (for regulator of 
sigma E), encoded immediately downstream of the sigma factor. Deletion of rseA 
leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity. RseA is predicted to be an 
inner membrane protein, and the purified cytoplasmic domain binds to and 
inhibits sigma(E)-directed transcription in vitro, indicating that RseA acts as 
an anti-sigma factor. Deletion of rseB leads to a slight induction of sigma(E), 
indicating that RseB is also a negative regulator of sigma(E). RseB is a 
periplasmic protein and was found to co-purify with the periplasmic domain of 
RseA, indicating that RseB probably exerts negative activity on sigma(E) through 
RseA. Deletion of rseC, in contrast, has no effect on sigma(E) activity under 
steady-state conditions. Under induction conditions, strains lacking RseB and/or 
C show wild-type induction of sigma(E) activity, indicating either the presence 
of multiple pathways regulating sigma(E) activity, or the ability of RseA alone 
to both sense and transmit information to sigma(E).

Modulation of the Escherichia coli sigmaE (RpoE) heat-shock transcription-factor

The sigma(E) (RpoE) transcription factor of Escherichia coli regulates the 
expression of genes whose products are devoted to extracytoplasmic activities. 
The sigma(E) regulon is induced upon misfolding of proteins in the periplasm or 
the outer membrane. Similar to other alternative sigma factors, the activity of 
sigma(E) is tightly regulated in E. coli. We have previously shown that sigma(E) 
is positively autoregulated at the transcriptional level. DNA sequencing, 
coupled with transcriptional analyses, have shown that sigma(E) is encoded by 
the first gene of a four-gene operon. The second gene of this operon, rseA, 
encodes an anti-sigma(E) activity. This was demonstrated at both the genetic and 
biochemical levels. For example, mutations in rseA constitutively increase 
sigma(E) activity. Consistent with this, overproduction of RseA leads to an 
inhibitory effect on sigma(E) activity. Topological analysis of RseA suggests 
the existence of one transmembrane domain, with the N-terminal part localized in 
the cytoplasm. Overproduction of this N-terminal domain alone was shown to 
inhibit sigma(E) activity. These observations were confirmed in vitro, because 
either purified RseA or only its purified N-terminal domain inhibited 
transcription from Esigma(E)-dependent promoters. Furthermore, RseA and sigma(E) 
co-purify, and can be co-immunoprecipitated, and chemically cross-linked. The 
sigma(E) activity is further modulated by the products of the remaining genes in 
this operon, rseB and rseC. RseB is a periplasmic protein, which negatively 
regulates sigma(E) activity and specifically interacts with the C-terminal 
periplasmic domain of RseA. In contrast, RseC is an inner membrane protein that 
positively modulates sigma(E) activity. Most of these protein-protein 
interactions were verified in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system.

CsrA of Escherichia coli is an RNA-binding protein that globally regulates a 
wide variety of cellular processes and behaviors, including carbon metabolism, 
motility, biofilm formation, and the stringent response. CsrB and CsrC are small 
RNAs (sRNAs) that sequester CsrA, thereby preventing CsrA-mRNA interaction. RpoE 
(σE) is the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor of E. coli Previous 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies identified rpoE mRNA as a CsrA target. Here, we 
explored the regulation of rpoE by CsrA and found that CsrA represses rpoE 
translation. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified 
three CsrA binding sites in the rpoE leader transcript, one of which overlaps 
the rpoE Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, while another overlaps the rpoE 
translation initiation codon. Coupled in vitro transcription-translation 
experiments showed that CsrA represses rpoE translation by binding to these 
sites. We further demonstrate that σE indirectly activates the transcription of 
csrB and csrC, leading to increased sequestration of CsrA, such that repression 
of rpoE by CsrA is reduced. We propose that the Csr system fine-tunes the 
σE-dependent cell envelope stress response. We also identified a 51-amino-acid 
coding sequence whose stop codon overlaps the rpoE start codon and demonstrate 
that rpoE is translationally coupled with this upstream open reading frame 
(ORF51). The loss of coupling reduces rpoE translation by more than 50%. 
Identification of a translationally coupled ORF upstream of rpoE suggests that 
this previously unannotated protein may participate in the cell envelope stress 
response. In keeping with existing nomenclature, we named ORF51 rseD, resulting 
in an operon arrangement of rseD-rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC IMPORTANCE CsrA 
posttranscriptionally represses genes required for bacterial stress responses, 
including the stringent response, catabolite repression, and the RpoS 
(σS)-mediated general stress response. We show that CsrA represses the 
translation of rpoE, encoding the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor, 
and that σE indirectly activates the transcription of csrB and csrC, resulting 
in reciprocal regulation of these two global regulatory systems. These findings 
suggest that extracytoplasmic stress leads to derepression of rpoE translation 
by CsrA, and CsrA-mediated repression helps reset RpoE abundance to prestress 
levels once envelope damage is repaired. The discovery of an ORF, rseD, 
translationally coupled with rpoE adds further complexity to translational 
control of rpoE.

The R1 conjugative plasmid increases Escherichia coli biofilm formation through 
an envelope stress response.

Differential gene expression in biofilm cells suggests that adding the 
derepressed conjugative plasmid R1drd19 increases biofilm formation by affecting 
genes related to envelope stress (rseA and cpxAR), biofilm formation (bssR and 
cstA), energy production (glpDFK), acid resistance (gadABCEX and hdeABD), and 
cell motility (csgBEFG, yehCD, yadC, and yfcV); genes encoding outer membrane 
proteins (ompACF), phage shock proteins (pspABCDE), and cold shock proteins 
(cspACDEG); and phage-related genes. To investigate the link between the 
identified genes and biofilm formation upon the addition of R1drd19, 40 isogenic 
mutants were classified according to their different biofilm formation 
phenotypes. Cells with class I mutations (those in rseA, bssR, cpxA, and ompA) 
exhibited no difference from the wild-type strain in biofilm formation and no 
increase in biofilm formation upon the addition of R1drd19. Cells with class II 
mutations (those in gatC, yagI, ompC, cspA, pspD, pspB, ymgB, gadC, pspC, ymgA, 
slp, cpxP, cpxR, cstA, rseC, ompF, and yqjD) displayed increased biofilm 
formation compared to the wild-type strain but decreased biofilm formation upon 
the addition of R1drd19. Class III mutants showed increased biofilm formation 
compared to the wild-type strain and increased biofilm formation upon the 
addition of R1drd19. Cells with class IV mutations displayed increased biofilm 
formation compared to the wild-type strain but little difference upon the 
addition of R1drd19, and class V mutants exhibited no difference from the 
wild-type strain but increased biofilm formation upon the addition of R1drd19. 
Therefore, proteins encoded by the genes corresponding to the class I mutant 
phenotype are involved in R1drd19-promoted biofilm formation, primarily through 
their impact on cell motility. We hypothesize that the pili formed upon the 
addition of the conjugative plasmid disrupt the membrane (induce ompA) and 
activate the two-component system CpxAR as well as the other envelope stress 
response system, RseA-sigma(E), both of which, along with BssR, play a key role 
in bacterial biofilm formation.

The sigma(E) (RpoE) transcription factor of Escherichia coli regulates the 
expression of genes whose products are devoted to extracytoplasmic activities. 
The sigma(E) regulon is induced upon misfolding of proteins in the periplasm or 
the outer membrane. Similar to other alternative sigma factors, the activity of 
sigma(E) is tightly regulated in E. coli. We have previously shown that sigma(E) 
is positively autoregulated at the transcriptional level. DNA sequencing, 
coupled with transcriptional analyses, have shown that sigma(E) is encoded by 
the first gene of a four-gene operon. The second gene of this operon, rseA, 
encodes an anti-sigma(E) activity. This was demonstrated at both the genetic and 
biochemical levels. For example, mutations in rseA constitutively increase 
sigma(E) activity. Consistent with this, overproduction of RseA leads to an 
inhibitory effect on sigma(E) activity. Topological analysis of RseA suggests 
the existence of one transmembrane domain, with the N-terminal part localized in 
the cytoplasm. Overproduction of this N-terminal domain alone was shown to 
inhibit sigma(E) activity. These observations were confirmed in vitro, because 
either purified RseA or only its purified N-terminal domain inhibited 
transcription from Esigma(E)-dependent promoters. Furthermore, RseA and sigma(E) 
co-purify, and can be co-immunoprecipitated, and chemically cross-linked. The 
sigma(E) activity is further modulated by the products of the remaining genes in 
this operon, rseB and rseC. RseB is a periplasmic protein, which negatively 
regulates sigma(E) activity and specifically interacts with the C-terminal 
periplasmic domain of RseA. In contrast, RseC is an inner membrane protein that 
positively modulates sigma(E) activity. Most of these protein-protein 
interactions were verified in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system.

CsrA of Escherichia coli is an RNA-binding protein that globally regulates a 
wide variety of cellular processes and behaviors, including carbon metabolism, 
motility, biofilm formation, and the stringent response. CsrB and CsrC are small 
RNAs (sRNAs) that sequester CsrA, thereby preventing CsrA-mRNA interaction. RpoE 
(σE) is the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor of E. coli Previous 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies identified rpoE mRNA as a CsrA target. Here, we 
explored the regulation of rpoE by CsrA and found that CsrA represses rpoE 
translation. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified 
three CsrA binding sites in the rpoE leader transcript, one of which overlaps 
the rpoE Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, while another overlaps the rpoE 
translation initiation codon. Coupled in vitro transcription-translation 
experiments showed that CsrA represses rpoE translation by binding to these 
sites. We further demonstrate that σE indirectly activates the transcription of 
csrB and csrC, leading to increased sequestration of CsrA, such that repression 
of rpoE by CsrA is reduced. We propose that the Csr system fine-tunes the 
σE-dependent cell envelope stress response. We also identified a 51-amino-acid 
coding sequence whose stop codon overlaps the rpoE start codon and demonstrate 
that rpoE is translationally coupled with this upstream open reading frame 
(ORF51). The loss of coupling reduces rpoE translation by more than 50%. 
Identification of a translationally coupled ORF upstream of rpoE suggests that 
this previously unannotated protein may participate in the cell envelope stress 
response. In keeping with existing nomenclature, we named ORF51 rseD, resulting 
in an operon arrangement of rseD-rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC IMPORTANCE CsrA 
posttranscriptionally represses genes required for bacterial stress responses, 
including the stringent response, catabolite repression, and the RpoS 
(σS)-mediated general stress response. We show that CsrA represses the 
translation of rpoE, encoding the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor, 
and that σE indirectly activates the transcription of csrB and csrC, resulting 
in reciprocal regulation of these two global regulatory systems. These findings 
suggest that extracytoplasmic stress leads to derepression of rpoE translation 
by CsrA, and CsrA-mediated repression helps reset RpoE abundance to prestress 
levels once envelope damage is repaired. The discovery of an ORF, rseD, 
translationally coupled with rpoE adds further complexity to translational 
control of rpoE.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

Dissection of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis in Escherichia coli: roles of RpoE 
regulators RseA, RseB and periplasmic folding catalyst PpiD.

University, Ube, Japan.

To understand the mechanism of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis, we examined the 
consequences of deletion derivatives of rpoE regulators rseA, rseB and rseC on 
sigma(E) transcription, on levels of free versus membrane-bound sigma(E) and on 
OMP-biogenesis limiting factor(s) that could impact cell lysis. RT-PCR showed 
that individual nonpolar DeltarseA and DeltarseB increased the rpoE expression 
to varying extents, with pronounced induction in DeltarseA. Significantly the 
ratio of soluble (free) versus membrane-bound form of RpoE increased in 
DeltarseA, however without increase of its total amount, unraveling furthermore 
complexity in RpoE regulation. Significant characteristics of cell lysis, 
accompanied by a severe reduction in the levels of periplasmic OMP-folding 
factor (PpiD), were observed in DeltarseA. The cell-lysis phenotype of DeltarseA 
was suppressed by either rseA or ppiD plasmids, but neither by rseB nor by rseC 
clones. However, the cell lysis of the wild-type strain was almost completely 
repressed not only by the rseA clone but also by the rseB clone, suggesting RseB 
might be limiting in vivo. Thus, increase in the ratio of free sigma(E) in rseA 
mutants with a concomitant reduction in PpiD levels can account for 
sigma(E)-dependent lysis in concert with a potential role of small RNAs on the 
lysis process.

The rpoE gene encoding an RNA polymerase sigmaE subunit was isolated from a 
gamma-phage library of the deep-sea piezophilic and psychrophilic bacterium 
Shewanella violacea strain DSS12. Structual analysis showed that the gene 
organization of the fragment containing S. violacearpoE was the l-aspartate 
oxidase-coding gene, rpoE, rseA, rseB and rseC in that order, the same as in the 
case of Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Escherichia coli K-12. The cloned gene, 
576 bp in length, was found to encode a protein consisting of 192 amino acid 
residues with a molecular mass of 21,806 Da. Amino acid alignment of the RpoE 
protein showed that the functional domains responsible for DNA recognition, DNA 
melting, core binding, and RseA interaction were highly conserved. We purified 
hexahistidine-fused RpoE protein by constructing an overexpression plasmid. 
Core-binding analysis revealed that the cloned RpoE protein has the ability to 
bind with core RNA polymerase as a sigma factor.

The soxRS regulon functions in protecting Escherichia coli cells against 
superoxide and nitric oxide. When SoxR is activated by oxidation of its [2Fe-2S] 
cluster, it increases the synthesis of SoxS, which then activates its target 
gene expression. How the oxidized SoxR returns to and is maintained in its 
reduced state has been under question. To identity genes that constitute the 
SoxR-reducing system, we screened an E.coli mutant library carrying a 
chromosomal soxSp::lacZ fusion, for constitutive mutants. Mutations mapped to 
two loci: the rsxABCDGE operon (named for reducer of SoxR) that is highly 
homologous to the rnfABCDGE operon in Rhodobacter capsulatus involved in 
transferring electrons to nitrogenase, and the rseC gene in the rpoE-rseABC 
operon. In-frame deletion of each open reading frame in the rsxABCDGE operon 
produced a similar constitutive phenotype. The double mutation of rsx and rseC 
suggested that rsxABCDGE and rseC gene products act together in the same pathway 
in reducing SoxR. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis of SoxR and 
measurement of re-reduction kinetics support the proposal that rsx and rseC gene 
products constitute a reducing system for SoxR.

peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

To understand the mechanism of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis, we examined the 
consequences of deletion derivatives of rpoE regulators rseA, rseB and rseC on 
sigma(E) transcription, on levels of free versus membrane-bound sigma(E) and on 
OMP-biogenesis limiting factor(s) that could impact cell lysis. RT-PCR showed 
that individual nonpolar DeltarseA and DeltarseB increased the rpoE expression 
to varying extents, with pronounced induction in DeltarseA. Significantly the 
ratio of soluble (free) versus membrane-bound form of RpoE increased in 
DeltarseA, however without increase of its total amount, unraveling furthermore 
complexity in RpoE regulation. Significant characteristics of cell lysis, 
accompanied by a severe reduction in the levels of periplasmic OMP-folding 
factor (PpiD), were observed in DeltarseA. The cell-lysis phenotype of DeltarseA 
was suppressed by either rseA or ppiD plasmids, but neither by rseB nor by rseC 
clones. However, the cell lysis of the wild-type strain was almost completely 
repressed not only by the rseA clone but also by the rseB clone, suggesting RseB 
might be limiting in vivo. Thus, increase in the ratio of free sigma(E) in rseA 
mutants with a concomitant reduction in PpiD levels can account for 
sigma(E)-dependent lysis in concert with a potential role of small RNAs on the 
lysis process.

The rpoE gene encoding an RNA polymerase sigmaE subunit was isolated from a 
gamma-phage library of the deep-sea piezophilic and psychrophilic bacterium 
Shewanella violacea strain DSS12. Structual analysis showed that the gene 
organization of the fragment containing S. violacearpoE was the l-aspartate 
oxidase-coding gene, rpoE, rseA, rseB and rseC in that order, the same as in the 
case of Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Escherichia coli K-12. The cloned gene, 
576 bp in length, was found to encode a protein consisting of 192 amino acid 
residues with a molecular mass of 21,806 Da. Amino acid alignment of the RpoE 
protein showed that the functional domains responsible for DNA recognition, DNA 
melting, core binding, and RseA interaction were highly conserved. We purified 
hexahistidine-fused RpoE protein by constructing an overexpression plasmid. 
Core-binding analysis revealed that the cloned RpoE protein has the ability to 
bind with core RNA polymerase as a sigma factor.

The sigmaE-mediated response to extracytoplasmic stress in Escherichia coli is 
transduced by RseA and RseB, two negative regulators of sigmaE.

The extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli is controlled by the 
alternative sigma factor, sigma(E). sigma(E) activity is uniquely induced by the 
accumulation of outer membrane protein precursors in the periplasmic space, and 
leads to the increased production of several proteins, including the periplasmic 
protease DegP, that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular 
integrity under stress conditions. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that 
sigma(E) activity is under the control of three genes, rseABC (for regulator of 
sigma E), encoded immediately downstream of the sigma factor. Deletion of rseA 
leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity. RseA is predicted to be an 
inner membrane protein, and the purified cytoplasmic domain binds to and 
inhibits sigma(E)-directed transcription in vitro, indicating that RseA acts as 
an anti-sigma factor. Deletion of rseB leads to a slight induction of sigma(E), 
indicating that RseB is also a negative regulator of sigma(E). RseB is a 
periplasmic protein and was found to co-purify with the periplasmic domain of 
RseA, indicating that RseB probably exerts negative activity on sigma(E) through 
RseA. Deletion of rseC, in contrast, has no effect on sigma(E) activity under 
steady-state conditions. Under induction conditions, strains lacking RseB and/or 
C show wild-type induction of sigma(E) activity, indicating either the presence 
of multiple pathways regulating sigma(E) activity, or the ability of RseA alone 
to both sense and transmit information to sigma(E).

Modulation of the Escherichia coli sigmaE (RpoE) heat-shock transcription-factor 
activity by the RseA, RseB and RseC proteins.

The sigma(E) (RpoE) transcription factor of Escherichia coli regulates the 
expression of genes whose products are devoted to extracytoplasmic activities. 
The sigma(E) regulon is induced upon misfolding of proteins in the periplasm or 
the outer membrane. Similar to other alternative sigma factors, the activity of 
sigma(E) is tightly regulated in E. coli. We have previously shown that sigma(E) 
is positively autoregulated at the transcriptional level. DNA sequencing, 
coupled with transcriptional analyses, have shown that sigma(E) is encoded by 
the first gene of a four-gene operon. The second gene of this operon, rseA, 
encodes an anti-sigma(E) activity. This was demonstrated at both the genetic and 
biochemical levels. For example, mutations in rseA constitutively increase 
sigma(E) activity. Consistent with this, overproduction of RseA leads to an 
inhibitory effect on sigma(E) activity. Topological analysis of RseA suggests 
the existence of one transmembrane domain, with the N-terminal part localized in 
the cytoplasm. Overproduction of this N-terminal domain alone was shown to 
inhibit sigma(E) activity. These observations were confirmed in vitro, because 
either purified RseA or only its purified N-terminal domain inhibited 
transcription from Esigma(E)-dependent promoters. Furthermore, RseA and sigma(E) 
co-purify, and can be co-immunoprecipitated, and chemically cross-linked. The 
sigma(E) activity is further modulated by the products of the remaining genes in 
this operon, rseB and rseC. RseB is a periplasmic protein, which negatively 
regulates sigma(E) activity and specifically interacts with the C-terminal 
periplasmic domain of RseA. In contrast, RseC is an inner membrane protein that 
positively modulates sigma(E) activity. Most of these protein-protein 
interactions were verified in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system.

Response Systems.

CsrA of Escherichia coli is an RNA-binding protein that globally regulates a 
wide variety of cellular processes and behaviors, including carbon metabolism, 
motility, biofilm formation, and the stringent response. CsrB and CsrC are small 
RNAs (sRNAs) that sequester CsrA, thereby preventing CsrA-mRNA interaction. RpoE 
(σE) is the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor of E. coli Previous 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies identified rpoE mRNA as a CsrA target. Here, we 
explored the regulation of rpoE by CsrA and found that CsrA represses rpoE 
translation. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified 
three CsrA binding sites in the rpoE leader transcript, one of which overlaps 
the rpoE Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, while another overlaps the rpoE 
translation initiation codon. Coupled in vitro transcription-translation 
experiments showed that CsrA represses rpoE translation by binding to these 
sites. We further demonstrate that σE indirectly activates the transcription of 
csrB and csrC, leading to increased sequestration of CsrA, such that repression 
of rpoE by CsrA is reduced. We propose that the Csr system fine-tunes the 
σE-dependent cell envelope stress response. We also identified a 51-amino-acid 
coding sequence whose stop codon overlaps the rpoE start codon and demonstrate 
that rpoE is translationally coupled with this upstream open reading frame 
(ORF51). The loss of coupling reduces rpoE translation by more than 50%. 
Identification of a translationally coupled ORF upstream of rpoE suggests that 
this previously unannotated protein may participate in the cell envelope stress 
response. In keeping with existing nomenclature, we named ORF51 rseD, resulting 
in an operon arrangement of rseD-rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC IMPORTANCE CsrA 
posttranscriptionally represses genes required for bacterial stress responses, 
including the stringent response, catabolite repression, and the RpoS 
(σS)-mediated general stress response. We show that CsrA represses the 
translation of rpoE, encoding the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor, 
and that σE indirectly activates the transcription of csrB and csrC, resulting 
in reciprocal regulation of these two global regulatory systems. These findings 
suggest that extracytoplasmic stress leads to derepression of rpoE translation 
by CsrA, and CsrA-mediated repression helps reset RpoE abundance to prestress 
levels once envelope damage is repaired. The discovery of an ORF, rseD, 
translationally coupled with rpoE adds further complexity to translational 
control of rpoE.

In E. coli, sigmaE-dependent transcription is controlled by 
regulated-proteolysis of RseA. RseA, which holds sigmaE as an anti-sigma factor, 
is sequentially digested by DegS, RseP and cytoplasmic proteases to liberate 
sigmaE in response to dysfunction in outer-membrane biogenesis. Additionally, 
the sequential proteolysis is regulated by RseB binding to RseA (Fig. 1A). 
Direct interaction between RseA and RseB inhibits RseA-cleavage by DegS. Both 
proteolytic activation of DegS and binding disruption of RseB are thus required 
to initiate sigmaE-stress response. For the induction of sigmaEstress response, 
DegS and RseB recognize the states of OMP and LPS for outer-membrane biogenesis. 
DegS is activated by binding of unfolded OMPs and RseB binding to RseA is 
antagonized by LPS accumulated in periplasm. In this regard, DegS and RseB are 
proposed to be stress sensor proteins for sigmaE signal transduction. 
Interestingly, biogenesis of OMP and LPS appears to cross-talk with each other, 
indicating that dysfunction of either OMP or LPS can initiate RseA proteolysis. 
This review aims to briefly introduce two stress sensor proteins, DegS and RseB, 
which regulate sigmaEdependent transcription.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

Dual molecular signals mediate the bacterial response to outer-membrane stress.

In Gram-negative bacteria, outer-membrane integrity is essential for survival 
and is monitored by the σ(E) stress-response system, which initiates 
damage-repair pathways. One activating signal is unassembled outer-membrane 
proteins. Using biochemical and genetic experiments in Escherichia coli, we 
found that off-pathway intermediates in lipopolysaccharide transport and 
assembly provided an additional required signal. These distinct signals, arising 
from disruptions in the transport and assembly of the major outer-membrane 
components, jointly determined the rate of proteolytic destruction of a negative 
regulator of the σ(E) transcription factor, thereby modulating the expression of 
stress-response genes. This dual-signal system permits a rapid response to 
dysfunction in outer-membrane biogenesis, while buffering responses to transient 
fluctuations in individual components, and may represent a broad strategy for 
bacteria to monitor their interface with the environment.

Signal integration by DegS and RseB governs the &#963; E-mediated envelope

In Escherichia coli, the σ(E) transcription factor monitors and maintains outer 
membrane (OM) integrity by activating genes required for assembly of its two key 
components, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by 
transcribing small RNAs to down-regulate excess unassembled OMPs. σ(E) activity 
is governed by the rate of degradation of its membrane-spanning anti-σ factor, 
RseA. Importantly, the DegS protease can initiate RseA cleavage only when 
activated by binding to unassembled OMPs. The prevalent paradigm has been that 
the σ(E) response is controlled by the amount of activated DegS. Here we 
demonstrate that inactivation of a second negative regulator, the periplasmic 
protein RseB, is also required for σ(E) induction in vivo. Moreover, OMPs, 
previously known only to activate DegS, also generate a signal to antagonize 
RseB inhibition. This signal may be lipid related, as RseB is structurally 
similar to proteins that bind lipids. We propose that the use of an AND gate 
enables σ(E) to sense and integrate multivariate signals from the envelope.

Structural basis for the negative regulation of bacterial stress response by 
RseB.

Medicine, Suwon 440-746, Korea.

The sigmaE-dependent stress response in bacterial cells is initiated by the 
DegS- and RseP-regulated intramembrane proteolysis of a membrane-spanning 
antisigma factor, RseA. RseB binds to RseA and inhibits its sequential cleavage, 
thereby functioning as a negative modulator of this response. In the crystal 
structure of the periplasmic domain of RseA bound to RseB, the DegS cleavage 
site of RseA is unstructured, however, its P1 residue is buried in the 
hydrophobic pocket of RseB, which suggests that RseB binding blocks the access 
of DegS to the cleavage site.

The Escherichia coli envelope stress response is controlled by the alternative 
sigma factor, sigma(E), and is induced when unfolded outer membrane proteins 
accumulate in the periplasm. The response is initiated by sequential cleavage of 
the membrane-spanning antisigma factor, RseA. RseB is an important negative 
regulator of envelope stress response that exerts its negative effects 
onsigma(E) activity through its binding to RseA. In this study, we analyze the 
interaction between RseA and RseB. We found that tight binding of RseB to RseA 
required intact RseB. Using programs that performed global and local sequence 
alignment of RseB and RseA, we found regions of high similarity and performed 
alanine substitution mutagenesis to test the hypothesis that these regions were 
functionally important. This protocol is based on the hypothesis that 
functionally dependent regions of two proteins co-evolve and therefore are 
likely to be sequentially conserved. This procedure allowed us to identify both 
an N-terminal and C-terminal region in RseB important for binding to RseA. We 
extensively analyzed the C-terminal region, which aligns with a region of RseA 
coincident with the major RseB binding determinant in RseA. Both allele-specific 
suppression analysis and cysteine-mediated disulfide bond formation indicated 
that this C-terminal region of similarity of RseA and RseB identifies a contact 
site between the two proteins. We suggest a similar protocol can be successfully 
applied to pairs of non-homologous but functionally linked proteins to find 
specific regions of the protein sequences that are important for establishing 
functional linkage.

The bacterial envelope stress response, which is responsible for sensing stress 
signals in the envelope and for turning on the sigma(E)-dependent transcription, 
is modulated by the binding of RseB to RseA. In this study, the solution 
structures of RseA and its complex with RseB were analyzed using circular 
dichroism and small-angle X-ray scattering. The periplasmic domain of RseA is 
unstructured and flexible when it is not bound to RseB. However, upon the 
formation of the stable complex with RseB, RseA induces conformational changes 
in RseB and, at the same time, RseA becomes more structured. Furthermore, it 
appears that some other undefined region of RseA, as well as the previously 
identified minimum region (amino acid 169-186), is also involved in RseB 
binding. It is thought that these conformational changes are relevant to the 
proteolytic cleavage of RseA and the modulation of envelope stress response.

An elegant network of signal transduction has evolved in the bacterial cell 
envelope to respond to environmental stress. It is initiated by sensing 
unfavourable and harmful changes in the periplasm. The stress signal is then 
transmitted by a controlled degradation of the transmembrane anti-sigma-factor 
RseA that leads to the activation of the alternative sigma factor sigma(E). The 
periplasmic protein RseB exerts a crucial role in modulating the stability of 
RseA. RseB from Escherichia coli has been crystallized and crystal structures 
were determined at 2.4 A and at 2.8 A resolution. The protein forms a homodimer, 
with the monomer composed of two domains. The large domain resembles an unclosed 
beta-barrel that is structurally remarkably similar to a protein family capable 
of binding the lipid anchor of lipoproteins. The small C-terminal domain, 
connected to the large domain by a partially unstructured loop, is responsible 
for interaction with RseA. On the basis of the structure of RseB, we suggest 
that it acts as a sensor of periplasmic stress with a dual functionality: it 
detects mislocalized lipoproteins and propagates the signal to induce the 
sigma(E)-response.

CsrA of Escherichia coli is an RNA-binding protein that globally regulates a 
wide variety of cellular processes and behaviors, including carbon metabolism, 
motility, biofilm formation, and the stringent response. CsrB and CsrC are small 
RNAs (sRNAs) that sequester CsrA, thereby preventing CsrA-mRNA interaction. RpoE 
(σE) is the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor of E. coli Previous 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies identified rpoE mRNA as a CsrA target. Here, we 
explored the regulation of rpoE by CsrA and found that CsrA represses rpoE 
translation. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified 
three CsrA binding sites in the rpoE leader transcript, one of which overlaps 
the rpoE Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, while another overlaps the rpoE 
translation initiation codon. Coupled in vitro transcription-translation 
experiments showed that CsrA represses rpoE translation by binding to these 
sites. We further demonstrate that σE indirectly activates the transcription of 
csrB and csrC, leading to increased sequestration of CsrA, such that repression 
of rpoE by CsrA is reduced. We propose that the Csr system fine-tunes the 
σE-dependent cell envelope stress response. We also identified a 51-amino-acid 
coding sequence whose stop codon overlaps the rpoE start codon and demonstrate 
that rpoE is translationally coupled with this upstream open reading frame 
(ORF51). The loss of coupling reduces rpoE translation by more than 50%. 
Identification of a translationally coupled ORF upstream of rpoE suggests that 
this previously unannotated protein may participate in the cell envelope stress 
response. In keeping with existing nomenclature, we named ORF51 rseD, resulting 
in an operon arrangement of rseD-rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC IMPORTANCE CsrA 
posttranscriptionally represses genes required for bacterial stress responses, 
including the stringent response, catabolite repression, and the RpoS 
(σS)-mediated general stress response. We show that CsrA represses the 
translation of rpoE, encoding the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor, 
and that σE indirectly activates the transcription of csrB and csrC, resulting 
in reciprocal regulation of these two global regulatory systems. These findings 
suggest that extracytoplasmic stress leads to derepression of rpoE translation 
by CsrA, and CsrA-mediated repression helps reset RpoE abundance to prestress 
levels once envelope damage is repaired. The discovery of an ORF, rseD, 
translationally coupled with rpoE adds further complexity to translational 
control of rpoE.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria use alternative sigma factors (σs) to regulate 
condition-specific gene expression for survival and Shewanella harbors multiple 
ECF (extracytoplasmic function) σ genes and cognate anti-sigma factor genes. 
Here we comparatively analyzed two of the rpoE-like operons in the strain MR-1: 
rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC and rpoE2-chrR.
RESULTS: RpoE was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, 
in the minimal medium, and high salinity. The degP/htrA orthologue, required for 
growth of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is 
absent in Shewanella, while the degQ gene is RpoE-regulated and is required for 
bacterial growth at high temperature. RpoE2 was essential for the optimal growth 
in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoE2 mutant was sensitive to 
hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. The operon encoding a ferrochelatase paralogue 
(HemH2) and a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase (PgpD) was identified as 
RpoE2-dependent. PgpD exhibited higher activities and played a more important 
role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione 
peroxidase CgpD under tested conditions. The rpoE2-chrR operon and the 
identified regulon genes, including pgpD and hemH2, are coincidently absent in 
several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea Shewanella strains.
CONCLUSION: In S. oneidensis MR-1, the RpoE-dependent degQ gene is required for 
optimal growth under high temperature. The rpoE2 and RpoE2-dependent pgpD gene 
encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress 
responses. But rpoE2 is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and 
it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a 
tradeoff between the salt resistance and RpoE2-mediated oxidative stress 
responses.

Members of the genus Vibrio are important marine and aquaculture pathogens. 
Hemolytic activity has been identified as a virulence factor in many pathogenic 
vibrios including V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, V. harveyi 
and V. vulnificus. We have used transposon mutagenesis to identify genes 
involved in the hemolytic activity of shrimp-pathogenic V. harveyi strain 
PSU3316. Out of 1,764 mutants screened, five mutants showed reduced hemolytic 
activity on sheep blood agar and exhibited virulence attenuation in shrimp 
(Litopenaeus vannamei). Mutants were identified by comparing transposon junction 
sequences to a draft of assembly of the PSU3316 genome. Surprisingly none of the 
disrupted open reading frames or gene neighborhoods contained genes annotated as 
hemolysins. The gene encoding RseB, a negative regulator of the sigma factor 
(σ(E)), was interrupted in 2 out of 5 transposon mutants, in addition, the 
transcription factor CytR, a threonine synthetase, and an efflux-associated 
cytoplasmic protein were also identified. Knockout mutations introduced into the 
rpoE operon at the rseB gene exhibited low hemolytic activity in sheep blood 
agar, and were 3-to 7-fold attenuated for colonization in shrimp. Comparison of 
whole cell extracted proteins in the rseB mutant (PSU4030) to the wild-type by 
2-D gel electrophoresis revealed 6 differentially expressed proteins, including 
two down-regulated porins (OmpC-like and OmpN) and an upregulated protease 
(DegQ) which have been associated with σ(E) in other organisms. Our study is the 
first report linking hemolytic activity to the σ(E) regulators in pathogenic 
Vibrio species and suggests expression of this virulence-linked phenotype is 
governed by multiple regulatory pathways within the V. harveyi.

Dissection of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis in Escherichia coli: roles of RpoE 
regulators RseA, RseB and periplasmic folding catalyst PpiD.

University, Ube, Japan.

To understand the mechanism of sigma(E)-dependent cell lysis, we examined the 
consequences of deletion derivatives of rpoE regulators rseA, rseB and rseC on 
sigma(E) transcription, on levels of free versus membrane-bound sigma(E) and on 
OMP-biogenesis limiting factor(s) that could impact cell lysis. RT-PCR showed 
that individual nonpolar DeltarseA and DeltarseB increased the rpoE expression 
to varying extents, with pronounced induction in DeltarseA. Significantly the 
ratio of soluble (free) versus membrane-bound form of RpoE increased in 
DeltarseA, however without increase of its total amount, unraveling furthermore 
complexity in RpoE regulation. Significant characteristics of cell lysis, 
accompanied by a severe reduction in the levels of periplasmic OMP-folding 
factor (PpiD), were observed in DeltarseA. The cell-lysis phenotype of DeltarseA 
was suppressed by either rseA or ppiD plasmids, but neither by rseB nor by rseC 
clones. However, the cell lysis of the wild-type strain was almost completely 
repressed not only by the rseA clone but also by the rseB clone, suggesting RseB 
might be limiting in vivo. Thus, increase in the ratio of free sigma(E) in rseA 
mutants with a concomitant reduction in PpiD levels can account for 
sigma(E)-dependent lysis in concert with a potential role of small RNAs on the 
lysis process.

The rpoE gene encoding an RNA polymerase sigmaE subunit was isolated from a 
gamma-phage library of the deep-sea piezophilic and psychrophilic bacterium 
Shewanella violacea strain DSS12. Structual analysis showed that the gene 
organization of the fragment containing S. violacearpoE was the l-aspartate 
oxidase-coding gene, rpoE, rseA, rseB and rseC in that order, the same as in the 
case of Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Escherichia coli K-12. The cloned gene, 
576 bp in length, was found to encode a protein consisting of 192 amino acid 
residues with a molecular mass of 21,806 Da. Amino acid alignment of the RpoE 
protein showed that the functional domains responsible for DNA recognition, DNA 
melting, core binding, and RseA interaction were highly conserved. We purified 
hexahistidine-fused RpoE protein by constructing an overexpression plasmid. 
Core-binding analysis revealed that the cloned RpoE protein has the ability to 
bind with core RNA polymerase as a sigma factor.

Modulation of the Escherichia coli sigmaE (RpoE) heat-shock transcription-factor 
activity by the RseA, RseB and RseC proteins.

The sigma(E) (RpoE) transcription factor of Escherichia coli regulates the 
expression of genes whose products are devoted to extracytoplasmic activities. 
The sigma(E) regulon is induced upon misfolding of proteins in the periplasm or 
the outer membrane. Similar to other alternative sigma factors, the activity of 
sigma(E) is tightly regulated in E. coli. We have previously shown that sigma(E) 
is positively autoregulated at the transcriptional level. DNA sequencing, 
coupled with transcriptional analyses, have shown that sigma(E) is encoded by 
the first gene of a four-gene operon. The second gene of this operon, rseA, 
encodes an anti-sigma(E) activity. This was demonstrated at both the genetic and 
biochemical levels. For example, mutations in rseA constitutively increase 
sigma(E) activity. Consistent with this, overproduction of RseA leads to an 
inhibitory effect on sigma(E) activity. Topological analysis of RseA suggests 
the existence of one transmembrane domain, with the N-terminal part localized in 
the cytoplasm. Overproduction of this N-terminal domain alone was shown to 
inhibit sigma(E) activity. These observations were confirmed in vitro, because 
either purified RseA or only its purified N-terminal domain inhibited 
transcription from Esigma(E)-dependent promoters. Furthermore, RseA and sigma(E) 
co-purify, and can be co-immunoprecipitated, and chemically cross-linked. The 
sigma(E) activity is further modulated by the products of the remaining genes in 
this operon, rseB and rseC. RseB is a periplasmic protein, which negatively 
regulates sigma(E) activity and specifically interacts with the C-terminal 
periplasmic domain of RseA. In contrast, RseC is an inner membrane protein that 
positively modulates sigma(E) activity. Most of these protein-protein 
interactions were verified in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system.

CsrA of Escherichia coli is an RNA-binding protein that globally regulates a 
wide variety of cellular processes and behaviors, including carbon metabolism, 
motility, biofilm formation, and the stringent response. CsrB and CsrC are small 
RNAs (sRNAs) that sequester CsrA, thereby preventing CsrA-mRNA interaction. RpoE 
(σE) is the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor of E. coli Previous 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies identified rpoE mRNA as a CsrA target. Here, we 
explored the regulation of rpoE by CsrA and found that CsrA represses rpoE 
translation. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified 
three CsrA binding sites in the rpoE leader transcript, one of which overlaps 
the rpoE Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, while another overlaps the rpoE 
translation initiation codon. Coupled in vitro transcription-translation 
experiments showed that CsrA represses rpoE translation by binding to these 
sites. We further demonstrate that σE indirectly activates the transcription of 
csrB and csrC, leading to increased sequestration of CsrA, such that repression 
of rpoE by CsrA is reduced. We propose that the Csr system fine-tunes the 
σE-dependent cell envelope stress response. We also identified a 51-amino-acid 
coding sequence whose stop codon overlaps the rpoE start codon and demonstrate 
that rpoE is translationally coupled with this upstream open reading frame 
(ORF51). The loss of coupling reduces rpoE translation by more than 50%. 
Identification of a translationally coupled ORF upstream of rpoE suggests that 
this previously unannotated protein may participate in the cell envelope stress 
response. In keeping with existing nomenclature, we named ORF51 rseD, resulting 
in an operon arrangement of rseD-rpoE-rseA-rseB-rseC IMPORTANCE CsrA 
posttranscriptionally represses genes required for bacterial stress responses, 
including the stringent response, catabolite repression, and the RpoS 
(σS)-mediated general stress response. We show that CsrA represses the 
translation of rpoE, encoding the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor, 
and that σE indirectly activates the transcription of csrB and csrC, resulting 
in reciprocal regulation of these two global regulatory systems. These findings 
suggest that extracytoplasmic stress leads to derepression of rpoE translation 
by CsrA, and CsrA-mediated repression helps reset RpoE abundance to prestress 
levels once envelope damage is repaired. The discovery of an ORF, rseD, 
translationally coupled with rpoE adds further complexity to translational 
control of rpoE.

Nitric oxide reactivities of the two globins of the foodborne pathogen 
Campylobacter jejuni: roles in protection from nitrosative stress and analysis 
of potential reductants.

BACKGROUND: During infection and pathogenesis, Campylobacter, the leading cause 
of gastroenteritis, encounters NO and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) derived 
from the host. To combat these species, Campylobacter jejuni expresses two 
haemoglobins: the single domain haemoglobin (Cgb) detoxifies NO but the role of 
the truncated globin (Ctb) is unclear. Confirmation of Cgb activity and more 
extensive exploration of Ctb function(s) in vivo are restricted due to 
difficulties in expressing proteins in Campylobacter and our lack of 
understanding of how the globin haems are re-reduced after ligand reactions.
METHODS: The cgb and ctb genes were cloned under the control of 
arabinose-inducible promoters and the globins expressed in an Escherichia coli 
mutant lacking the main NO detoxification mechanisms (Hmp and the Nor system 
comprising the transcription regulator NorR, the flavorubredoxin and its 
reductase (NorVW)); cellular responses under oxidative and nitrosative stress 
conditions were assessed. Spectroscopic changes of the Cgb and Ctb haems in 
soluble fractions after oxidation by NO were evaluated. Construction of E. coli 
nor mutants and a ubiquinone-defective strain allowed the exploration of the 
flavorubredoxin reductase and the aerobic respiratory chain as candidates for 
Cgb electron donors in E. coli mutants.
RESULTS: Cgb, but not Ctb, complements the NO- and RNS-sensitive phenotype of an 
E. coli hmp mutant in aerobic conditions; however, Cgb fails to protect an hmp 
norR mutant in the absence of oxygen. Reduction of Cgb and Ctb in E. coli and C. 
jejuni soluble extracts and turnover after NO oxidation is demonstrated. 
Finally, we report a minor role for NorW as a Cgb reductase partner in E. coli 
but no role for respiratory electron flux in globin redox cycling.
CONCLUSIONS: The NO detoxification capacity of Cgb is confirmed by heterologous 
expression in E. coli. The reducibility of Cgb and Ctb in E. coli and C. jejuni 
extracts and the lack of dependence of reduction upon flavorubredoxin reductase 
and the respiratory chain in E. coli argue in favor of a non-specific reductase 
system.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: We present the most persuasive evidence to date that Cgb, 
but not Ctb, confers tolerance to NO and RNS by reaction with NO. Since certain 
hypotheses for the mechanism of haem re-reduction in E. coli following the 
reaction with NO are not proven, the mechanisms of reduction in C. jejuni now 
require challenging experimental evaluation.

Nitric oxide homeostasis in Salmonella typhimurium: roles of respiratory nitrate 
reductase and flavohemoglobin.

Gilberthorpe NJ(1), Poole RK.

Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, United Kingdom.

Nitric oxide (NO) is generated in biological systems primarily via the activity 
of NO synthases and nitrate and nitrite reductases. Here we show that Salmonella 
enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) grown anaerobically with nitrate 
is capable of generating polarographically detectable NO after nitrite 
(NO(2)(-)) addition. NO accumulation is sensitive to the NO scavenger 
2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide. Neither an 
fnr mutant nor an fnr hmp double mutant produces NO, indicating the involvement 
in NO evolution from NO(2)(-) of protein(s) positively regulated by FNR. 
Contrary to previous findings in Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that neither 
the periplasmic nitrite reductase (NrfA) nor the cytoplasmic nitrite reductase 
(NirB) is involved in NO production in S. typhimurium. However, mutant cells 
lacking the membrane-bound nitrate reductase, NarGHI, and membranes derived from 
these cells are unable to produce NO, demonstrating that, in wild-type S. 
typhimurium, this enzyme is responsible for NO production. Membrane terminal 
oxidases cannot account for the NO levels measured. The nitrate reductase 
inhibitor, azide, abrogates NO evolution by Salmonella, and production of NO 
occurs only in the absence from the assays of nitrate; both features reveal a 
marked similarity between the NO-generating activities of this bacterium and 
plants. Unlike the situation in E. coli, an S. typhimurium hmp mutant produces 
NO both aerobically and anaerobically. Under aerobic conditions, when a 
functional flavohemoglobin is present, no NO is detectable. We propose a 
homeostatic mechanism in S. typhimurium, in which NO produced from NO(2)(-) by 
nitrate reductase derepresses Hmp expression (via FNR and NsrR) and NorV 
expression (via NorR) and thus limits NO toxicity.

Bacterial response to nitric oxide (NO) is of major importance since NO is an 
obligatory intermediate of the nitrogen cycle. Transcriptional regulation of the 
dissimilatory nitric oxides metabolism in bacteria is diverse and involves 
FNR-like transcription factors HcpR, DNR, and NnrR; two-component systems NarXL 
and NarQP; NO-responsive activator NorR; and nitrite-sensitive repressor NsrR. 
Using comparative genomics approaches, we predict DNA-binding motifs for these 
transcriptional factors and describe corresponding regulons in available 
bacterial genomes. Within the FNR family of regulators, we observed a 
correlation of two specificity-determining amino acids and contacting bases in 
corresponding DNA recognition motif. Highly conserved regulon HcpR for the 
hybrid cluster protein and some other redox enzymes is present in diverse 
anaerobic bacteria, including Clostridia, Thermotogales, and 
delta-proteobacteria. NnrR and DNR control denitrification in alpha- and 
beta-proteobacteria, respectively. Sigma-54-dependent NorR regulon found in some 
gamma- and beta-proteobacteria contains various enzymes involved in the NO 
detoxification. Repressor NsrR, which was previously known to control only 
nitrite reductase operon in Nitrosomonas spp., appears to be the master 
regulator of the nitric oxides' metabolism, not only in most gamma- and 
beta-proteobacteria (including well-studied species such as Escherichia coli), 
but also in gram-positive Bacillus and Streptomyces species. Positional analysis 
and comparison of regulatory regions of NO detoxification genes allows us to 
propose the candidate NsrR-binding motif. The most conserved member of the 
predicted NsrR regulon is the NO-detoxifying flavohemoglobin Hmp. In 
enterobacteria, the regulon also includes two nitrite-responsive loci, nipAB 
(hcp-hcr) and nipC (dnrN), thus confirming the identity of the effector, i.e. 
nitrite. The proposed NsrR regulons in Neisseria and some other species are 
extended to include denitrification genes. As the result, we demonstrate 
considerable interconnection between various nitrogen-oxides-responsive 
regulatory systems for the denitrification and NO detoxification genes and 
evolutionary plasticity of this transcriptional network.

Nitric oxide (NO) induces NO-detoxifying enzymes in Escherichia coli suggesting 
sensitive mechanisms for coordinate control of NO defense genes in response to 
NO stress. Exposure of E. coli to sub-micromolar NO levels under anaerobic 
conditions rapidly induced transcription of the NO reductase (NOR) structural 
genes, norV and norW, as monitored by lac gene fusions. Disruption of rpoN 
(sigma(54)) impaired the NO-mediated induction of norV and norW transcription 
and NOR expression, whereas disruption of the upstream regulatory gene, norR, 
completely ablated NOR induction. NOR inducibility was restored to NorR null 
mutants by expressing NorR in trans. Furthermore, an internal deletion of the 
N-terminal domain of NorR activated NOR expression independent of NO exposure. 
Neither NorR nor sigma(54) was essential for NO-mediated induction of the NO 
dioxygenase (flavohemoglobin) encoded by hmp. However, elevated NOR activity 
inhibited NO dioxygenase induction, and, in the presence of dioxygen, NO 
dioxygenase inhibited norV induction by NO. The results demonstrate the role of 
NorR as a sigma(54)-dependent regulator of norVW expression. A role for the NorR 
N-terminal domain as a transducer or sensor for NO is suggested.

Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is an important human pathogen 
causing severe diseases, such as hemorrhagic colitis and lethal hemolytic uremic 
syndrome. The signal-sensing capability of EHEC O157:H7 at specific host 
colonization sites via different two-component systems (TCSs) is closely related 
to its pathogenicity during infection. However, the types of systems involved 
and the regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we investigated 
the function of the TCS BarA/UvrY regulator UvrY in the pathogenicity regulation 
of EHEC O157:H7. Our results showed that UvrY acts as a positive regulator of 
EHEC O157:H7 for cellular adherence and mouse colonization through the 
transcriptional activation of the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) 
pathogenic genes. Furthermore, this regulation is mediated by the LEE island 
master regulator, Ler. Our results highlight the significance of UvrY in EHEC 
O157:H7 pathogenicity and underline the unknown importance of BarA/UvrY in 
colonization establishment and intestinal adaptability during infection.

BarA/UvrY, a two-component system and global regulator that controls expression 
of more than a hundred of genes involved in virulence, motility, biofilm 
formation, and central carbon metabolism under various stress conditions. In 
this study, we investigated the function of BarA/UvrY system in Serratia 
marcescens FS14. The disruption of barA or/and uvrY results in the yield 
increase of secondary metabolite prodigiosin. We further demonstrated that 
BarA/UvrY system represses prodigiosin production by inhibiting the 
transcription level of pig gene cluster with direct binding to the pigA 
promoter. In addition, deletion of barA or/and uvrY abolished the swarming 
motility of FS14, but not the swimming motility. We revealed that BarA/UvrY 
activates swarming through directly upregulating the expression of the 
biosurfactant synthesis gene swrW rather than flagella system. We also observed 
that BarA/UvrY positively regulates the resistance to H2O2 same as in 
Escherichia coli highlighting the importance of BarA/UvrY on hydrogen peroxide 
resistance. Our results demonstrated that the BarA/UvrY system differentially 
regulates the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite prodigiosin and swarming 
motility in S. marcescens FS14. Comparison of our results with those observed 
for Serratia sp. 39006 suggests that BarA/UvrY's role in regulation of secondary 
metabolite production is different among Serratia species.

Wound infections are often polymicrobial in nature, biofilm associated and 
therefore tolerant to antibiotic therapy, and associated with delayed healing. 
Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus are among the most frequently 
cultured pathogens from wound infections. However, little is known about the 
frequency or consequence of E. coli and S. aureus polymicrobial interactions 
during wound infections. Here we show that E. coli kills Staphylococci, 
including S. aureus, both in vitro and in a mouse excisional wound model via the 
genotoxin, colibactin. Colibactin biosynthesis is encoded by the pks locus, 
which we identified in nearly 30% of human E. coli wound infection isolates. 
While it is not clear how colibactin is released from E. coli or how it 
penetrates target cells, we found that the colibactin intermediate 
N-myristoyl-D-Asn (NMDA) disrupts the S. aureus membrane. We also show that the 
BarA-UvrY two component system (TCS) senses the environment created during E. 
coli and S. aureus mixed species interaction, leading to upregulation of pks 
island genes. Further, we show that BarA-UvrY acts via the carbon storage global 
regulatory (Csr) system to control pks expression. Together, our data 
demonstrate the role of colibactin in interspecies competition and show that it 
is regulated by BarA-UvrY TCS during interspecies competition.

Bacteria have to process several levels of gene regulation and coordination of 
interconnected regulatory networks to ensure the most adequate cellular response 
to specific growth conditions. Especially, expression of complex and costly 
fitness and pathogenicity-associated traits is coordinated and tightly regulated 
at multiple levels. We studied the interconnected regulation of the expression 
of the colibactin and yersiniabactin polyketide biosynthesis machineries, which 
are encoded by two pathogenicity islands found in many phylogroup B2 Escherichia 
coli isolates. Comparative phenotypic and genotypic analyses identified the 
BarA-UvrY two-component system as an important regulatory element involved in 
colibactin and yersiniabactin expression. The carbon storage regulator (Csr) 
system controls the expression of a wide range of central metabolic and 
virulence-associated traits. The availability of CsrA, the key translational 
regulator of the Csr system, depends on BarA-UvrY activity. We employed reporter 
gene fusions to demonstrate UvrY- and CsrA-dependent expression of the 
colibactin and yersiniabactin determinants and confirmed a direct interaction of 
CsrA with the 5' untranslated leader transcripts of representative genes of the 
colibactin and yersiniabactin operons by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift 
assays. This posttranscriptional regulation adds an additional level of 
complexity to control mechanisms of polyketide expression, which is also 
orchestrated at the level of ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-dependent regulation 
of transcription and phosphopantetheinyl transferase-dependent activation of 
polyketide biosynthesis. Our results emphasize the interconnection of iron- and 
primary metabolism-responsive regulation of colibactin and yersiniabactin 
expression by the fine-tuned action of different regulatory mechanisms in 
response to variable environmental signals as a prerequisite for bacterial 
adaptability, fitness, and pathogenicity in different habitats. IMPORTANCE 
Secondary metabolite expression is a widespread strategy among bacteria to 
improve their fitness in habitats where they constantly compete for resources 
with other bacteria. The production of secondary metabolites is associated with 
a metabolic and energetic burden. Colibactin and yersiniabactin are two 
polyketides, which are expressed in concert and promote the virulence of 
different enterobacterial pathogens. To maximize fitness, they should be 
expressed only in microenvironments in which they are required. Accordingly, 
precise regulation of colibactin and yersiniabactin expression is crucial. We 
show that the expression of these two polyketides is also interconnected via 
primary metabolism-responsive regulation at the posttranscriptional level by the 
CsrA RNA-binding protein. Our findings may help to optimize (over-)expression 
and further functional characterization of the polyketide colibactin. 
Additionally, this new aspect of concerted colibactin and yersiniabactin 
expression extends our knowledge of conditions that favor the expression of 
these virulence- and fitness-associated factors in different Enterobacterales 
members.

The BarA/UvrY two-component signal transduction system is widely conserved in 
γ-proteobacteria and provides a link between the metabolic state of the cells 
and the Csr posttranscriptional regulatory system. In Escherichia coli, the 
BarA/UvrY system responds to the presence of acetate and other short-chain 
carboxylic acids by activating transcription of the noncoding RNAs, CsrB and 
CsrC, which sequester the RNA-binding protein CsrA, a global regulator of gene 
expression. However, the state of the carboxyl group in the acetate molecule, 
which serves as the BarA stimulus, and the signal reception site of BarA remain 
unknown. In this study, we show that the deletion or replacement of the 
periplasmic domain of BarA and also the substitution of certain hydroxylated and 
hydrophobic amino acid residues in this region, result in a sensor kinase that 
remains unresponsive to its physiological stimulus, demonstrating that the 
periplasmic region of BarA constitutes a functional detector domain. Moreover, 
we provide evidence that the protonated state of acetate or formate serves as 
the physiological stimulus of BarA. In addition, modeling of the BarA sensor 
domain and prediction of the signal-binding site, by blind molecular docking, 
revealed a calcium channels and chemotaxis receptors domain with a conserved 
binding pocket, which comprised uncharged polar and hydrophobic amino acid 
residues. Based on the comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses, we 
propose that, at least, two types of BarA orthologues diverged and evolved 
separately to acquire distinct signal-binding properties, illustrating the wide 
adaptability of the bacterial sensor kinase proteins.

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the cAMP receptor protein (cAMP-CRP) and CsrA are the 
principal regulators of the catabolite repression and carbon storage global 
regulatory systems, respectively. cAMP-CRP controls the transcription of genes 
for carbohydrate metabolism and other processes in response to carbon 
nutritional status, while CsrA binds to diverse mRNAs and regulates translation, 
RNA stability, and/or transcription elongation. CsrA also binds to the 
regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) CsrB and CsrC, which antagonize its activity. The 
BarA-UvrY two-component signal transduction system (TCS) directly activates csrB 
and csrC (csrB/C) transcription, while CsrA does so indirectly. We show that 
cAMP-CRP inhibits csrB/C transcription without negatively regulating 
phosphorylated UvrY (P-UvrY) or CsrA levels. A crp deletion caused an elevation 
in CsrB/C levels in the stationary phase of growth and increased the expression 
of csrB-lacZ and csrC-lacZ transcriptional fusions, although modest stimulation 
of CsrB/C turnover by the crp deletion partially masked the former effects. 
DNase I footprinting and other studies demonstrated that cAMP-CRP bound 
specifically to three sites located upstream from the csrC promoter, two of 
which overlapped the P-UvrY binding site. These two proteins competed for 
binding at the overlapping sites. In vitro transcription-translation experiments 
confirmed direct repression of csrC-lacZ expression by cAMP-CRP. In contrast, 
cAMP-CRP effects on csrB transcription may be mediated indirectly, as it bound 
nonspecifically to csrB DNA. In the reciprocal direction, CsrA bound to crp mRNA 
with high affinity and specificity and yet exhibited only modest, conditional 
effects on expression. Our findings are incorporated into an emerging model for 
the response of Csr circuitry to carbon nutritional status.
IMPORTANCE: Csr (Rsm) noncoding small RNAs (sRNAs) CsrB and CsrC of Escherichia 
coli use molecular mimicry to sequester the RNA binding protein CsrA (RsmA) away 
from lower-affinity mRNA targets, thus eliciting major shifts in the bacterial 
lifestyle. CsrB/C transcription and turnover are activated by carbon metabolism 
products (e.g., formate and acetate) and by a preferred carbon source (glucose), 
respectively. We show that cAMP-CRP, a mediator of classical catabolite 
repression, inhibits csrC transcription by binding to the upstream region of 
this gene and also inhibits csrB transcription, apparently indirectly. We 
propose that glucose availability activates pathways for both synthesis and 
turnover of CsrB/C, thus shaping the dynamics of global signaling in response to 
the nutritional environment by poising CsrB/C sRNA levels for rapid response.

The two-component signal transduction system BarA-UvrY of Escherichia coli and 
its orthologs globally regulate metabolism, motility, biofilm formation, stress 
resistance, virulence of pathogens and quorum sensing by activating the 
transcription of genes for regulatory sRNAs, e.g. CsrB and CsrC in E. coli. 
These sRNAs act by sequestering the RNA binding protein CsrA (RsmA) away from 
lower affinity mRNA targets. In this study, we used ChIP-exo to identify, at 
single nucleotide resolution, genomic sites for UvrY (SirA) binding in E. coli 
and Salmonella enterica. The csrB and csrC genes were the strongest targets of 
crosslinking, which required UvrY phosphorylation by the BarA sensor kinase. 
Crosslinking occurred at two sites, an inverted repeat sequence far upstream of 
the promoter and a site near the -35 sequence. DNAse I footprinting revealed 
specific binding of UvrY in vitro only to the upstream site, indicative of 
additional binding requirements and/or indirect binding to the downstream site. 
Additional genes, including cspA, encoding the cold-shock RNA-binding protein 
CspA, showed weaker crosslinking and modest or negligible regulation by UvrY. We 
conclude that the global effects of UvrY/SirA on gene expression are primarily 
mediated by activating csrB and csrC transcription. We also used in vivo 
crosslinking and other experimental approaches to reveal new features of 
csrB/csrC regulation by the DeaD and SrmB RNA helicases, IHF, ppGpp and DksA. 
Finally, the phylogenetic distribution of BarA-UvrY was analyzed and found to be 
uniquely characteristic of γ-Proteobacteria and strongly anti-correlated with 
fliW, which encodes a protein that binds to CsrA and antagonizes its activity in 
Bacillus subtilis. We propose that BarA-UvrY and orthologous TCS transcribe sRNA 
antagonists of CsrA throughout the γ-Proteobacteria, but rarely or never perform 
this function in other species.

The hybrid sensor kinase BarA and its cognate response regulator UvrY, members 
of the two-component signal transduction family, activate transcription of CsrB 
and CsrC noncoding RNAs. These two small RNAs act by sequestering the RNA 
binding protein CsrA, which posttranscriptionally regulates translation and/or 
stability of its target mRNAs. Here, we provide evidence that CsrA positively 
affects, although indirectly, uvrY expression, at both the transcriptional and 
translational levels. We also demonstrate that CsrA is required for properly 
switching BarA from its phosphatase to its kinase activity. Thus, the existence 
of a feedback loop mechanism that involves the Csr and BarA/UvrY global 
regulatory systems is exposed.

In Escherichia coli, activity of the global regulatory RNA binding protein CsrA 
is antagonized by two non-coding sRNAs, CsrB and CsrC, which sequester it away 
from its lower affinity mRNA targets. Transcription of csrB/C requires the 
BarA-UvrY two component signal transduction system, which responds to short 
chain carboxylates. We show that two DEAD-box RNA helicases, DeaD and SrmB, 
activate csrB/C expression by different pathways. DeaD facilitates uvrY 
translation by counteracting the inhibitory effect of long distance base-pairing 
between the uvrY mRNA leader and coding region, while SrmB does not affect UvrY 
or UvrY-phosphate levels. Contrary to the prevailing notion that these helicases 
act primarily at low temperatures, DeaD and SrmB activated csrB expression over 
a wide temperature range. High-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by 
cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) revealed in vivo interactions of 
DeaD with 39 mRNAs, including those of uvrY and 9 other regulatory genes. 
Studies on the expression of several of the identified genes revealed regulatory 
effects of DeaD in all cases and diverse temperature response patterns. Our 
findings uncover an expanded regulatory role for DeaD, which is mediated through 
novel mRNA targets, important global regulators and under physiological 
conditions that were considered to be incompatible with its function.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), a member of extraintestinal pathogenic E. 
coli, cause ∼80% of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI) in humans. 
UPEC initiates its colonization in epithelial cells lining the urinary tract 
with a complicated life cycle, replicating and persisting in intracellular and 
extracellular niches. Consequently, UPEC causes cystitis and more severe form of 
pyelonephritis. To further understand the virulence characteristics of UPEC, we 
investigated the roles of BarA-UvrY two-component system (TCS) in regulating 
UPEC virulence. Our results showed that mutation of BarA-UvrY TCS significantly 
decreased the virulence of UPEC CFT073, as assessed by mouse urinary tract 
infection, chicken embryo killing assay, and cytotoxicity assay on human kidney 
and uroepithelial cell lines. Furthermore, mutation of either barA or uvrY gene 
reduced the production of hemolysin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), proinflammatory 
cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and chemokine (IL-8). The virulence phenotype was 
restored similar to that of wild-type by complementation of either barA or uvrY 
gene in trans. In addition, we discussed a possible link between the BarA-UvrY 
TCS and CsrA in positively and negatively controlling virulence in UPEC. 
Overall, this study provides the evidences for BarA-UvrY TCS regulates the 
virulence of UPEC CFT073 and may point to mechanisms by which virulence 
regulations are observed in different ways may control the long-term survival of 
UPEC in the urinary tract.

GcvA, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator protein, activates expression of the

cross-talk between DNA-binding proteins.

Escherichia coli JRG582 is an ampD ampE deletion derivative of strain HfrH and 
accordingly it is derepressed for expression of the cloned inducible 
beta-lactamase gene of Citrobacter freundii, carried on plasmid pNU305. 
Following chemical mutagenesis of JRG582(pNU305) a cefotaxime sensitive mutant 
was isolated, CS51(pNU305), which produced low levels of beta-lactamase due to a 
mutation in the host chromosome. Two recombinant plasmids containing genomic DNA 
from E. coli HfrH, namely pUB5608 and pUB5611, were isolated as a consequence of 
their ability to restore the beta-lactam resistant phenotype to CS51(pNU305). 
This ability was due to direct transcriptional activation of the beta-lactamase 
gene, ampC, rather than complementation of the CS51 mutation. Transposon 
mutagenesis and subcloning showed that restoration of ampicillin resistance to 
CS51(pNU305) was the function of a single gene, which maps at 60.3 min on the E. 
coli chromosome. The gene encodes a 33 kDa protein with significant homology to 
members of the LysR family of bacterial activator proteins, in particular the 
AmpR protein from C. freundii. Homology is especially strong over the N-terminal 
region which includes the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. This gene was 
shown to complement the gcvA1 mutation at 60.3 min on the E. coli chromosome, 
and the DNA sequence agrees exactly with the published sequence of gcvA which 
encodes the transcriptional activator of the inducible glycine cleavage enzyme 
system. It is suggested that GcvA can activate transcription of ampC by binding 
to the AmpR binding region upstream of ampC so as to mimic the activated state 
of AmpR and hence provides an example of cross-talk between DNA-binding proteins 
of different inducible enzyme systems.

Genetic localization and regulation of the maltose phosphorylase gene, malP, in 
Lactococcus lactis.

Institute of Technology, Lund University, PO Box 124, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden1.

Maltose phosphorylase (MP) from Lactococcus lactis was purified and the 
corresponding gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The isoelectric 
point of the pure enzyme was determined to be 7.0. According to zymogram 
analysis and SDS-PAGE, the native MP was shown to be a monomeric enzyme with a 
molecular mass of 75 kDa. A polyclonal antiserum was produced to assess the 
regulation of the gene encoding MP in LC: lactis. According to immunoblot 
analysis, synthesis of the enzyme was markedly repressed by both glucose and 
lactose in the growth medium. When the lactococci were cultivated in the 
presence of other sugars, including maltose, trehalose or galactose, there was a 
pronounced expression of the MP gene. In addition, when the cells were grown in 
media without any added sugar, there was also pronounced expression of the 
enzyme, according to immunoblot analysis and specific activity data. These 
results indicated that no particular sugar specifically induces the gene 
encoding MP. However, an effect of glucose on MP expression was demonstrated by 
performing fermentations in the presence of both maltose and glucose. When 
glucose was added to maltose-grown lactococci in the mid-exponential growth 
phase, both the specific activity and amount of MP per millilitre of cell 
extract decreased rapidly. The genetic locus for the MP gene was found to be in 
the vicinity of the region encoding a possible regulator belonging to the 
LacI-GalR family of transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, this genetic 
location was separated from the previously characterized maltose-inducible and 
glucose-repressible beta-phosphoglucomutase (beta-PGM) gene. The different 
genetic loci for the genes encoding MP and beta-PGM explains the different gene 
regulation behaviour.

Active site studies of bovine alpha1-->3-galactosyltransferase and its secondary

Biology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.

The catalytic domain of bovine alpha1-->3-galactosyltransferase (alpha3GalT), 
residues 80-368, have been cloned and expressed, in Escherichia coli. Using a 
sequential purification protocol involving a Ni(2+) affinity column followed by 
a UDP-hexanolamine affinity column, we have obtained a pure and active protein 
from the soluble fraction which catalyzes the transfer of galactose (Gal) from 
UDP-Gal to N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) with a specific activity of 0.69 
pmol/min/ng. The secondary structural content of alpha3GalT protein was analyzed 
by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which shows that the enzyme 
has about 35% beta-sheet and 22% alpha-helix. This predicted secondary structure 
content by FTIR spectroscopy was used in the protein sequence analysis 
algorithm, developed by the Biomolecular Engineering Research Center at Boston 
University and Tasc Inc., for the assignment of secondary structural elements to 
the amino acid sequence of alpha3GalT. The enzyme appears to have three major 
and three minor helices and five sheet-like structures. The studies on the 
acceptor substrate specificity of the enzyme, alpha3GalT, show that in addition 
to LacNAc, which is the natural substrate, the enzyme accepts various other 
disaccharides as substrates such as lactose and Gal derivatives, 
beta-O-methylgalactose and beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, albeit with lower 
specific activities. There is an absolute requirement for Gal to be at the 
non-reducing end of the acceptor molecule which has to be beta1-->4-linked to a 
second residue that can be more diverse in structure. The kinetic parameters for 
four acceptor molecules were determined. Lactose binds and functions in a 
similar way as LacNAc. However, beta-O-methylgalactose and Gal do not bind as 
tightly as LacNAc or lactose, as their K(ia) and K(A) values indicate, 
suggesting that the second monosaccharide is critical for holding the acceptor 
molecule in place. The 2' and 4' hydroxyl groups of the receiving Gal moiety are 
important in binding. Even though there is large structural variability 
associated with the second residue of the acceptor molecule, there are 
constraints which do not allow certain Gal-R sugars to be good acceptors for the 
enzyme. The beta1-->4-linked residue at the second position of the acceptor 
molecule is preferred, but the interactions between the enzyme and the second 
residue are likely to be non-specific.

Role of residue 147 in the gene regulatory function of the Escherichia coli 
purine repressor.

The crystal structures of corepressor-bound and free Escherichia coli purine 
repressor (PurR) have delineated the roles of several residues in corepressor 
binding and specificity and the intramolecular signal transduction (allosterism) 
of this LacI/GalR family member. From these structures, residue W147 was 
implicated as a key component of the allosteric response, but in many members of 
the LacI/GalR family, position 147 is occupied by an arginine. To understand the 
role of this tryptophan at position 147, three proteins, substituted by 
phenylalanine (W147F), alanine (W147A), or arginine (W147R), were constructed 
and characterized in vivo and in vitro, and their structures were determined. 
W147F displays a decreased affinity for corepressor and is a poor repressor in 
vivo. W147A and W147R, on the other hand, are super repressors and bind 
corepressor 13.6 and 7.9 times more tightly, respectively, than wild-type. Each 
mutant PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator holo complex crystallizes isomorphously 
to wild-type. Whereas the apo corepressor binding domain (CBD) of W147F 
crystallizes under those conditions used for the wild-type protein, neither the 
apo CBD of W147R nor W147A crystallizes, although screened extensively for new 
crystal forms. Structures of the holo repressor mutants have been solved to 
resolutions between 2.5 and 2.9 A, and the structure of the apo CBD of W147F has 
been solved to 2.4 A resolution. These structures provide insight into the 
altered biochemical properties and physiological functions of these mutants, 
which appear to depend on the sometimes subtle preference for one conformation 
(apo vs holo) over the other.

The role of lysine 55 in determining the specificity of the purine repressor for 
its operators through minor groove interactions.

(1)Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health Sciences 
University, Portland, OR, 97201-3098, USA.

The interaction of the dimeric Escherichia coli purine repressor (PurR) with its 
cognate sequences leads to a 45 degrees to 50 degrees kink at a central CpG base 
step towards the major groove, as dyad-related leucine side-chains interdigitate 
between these bases from the minor groove. The resulting broadening of the minor 
groove increases the accessibility of the six central base-pairs towards minor 
groove interactions with residues from PurR. It has been shown that lysine 55 of 
PurR makes a direct contact with the adenine base (Ade8) directly 5' to the 
central CpG base-pair step in the high-affinity purF operator sequence. We have 
investigated the importance of this interaction in the specificity and affinity 
of wild-type PurR (WT) for its operators and we have studied a mutant of PurR in 
which Lys55 is replaced with alanine (K55A). Complexes of WT and K55A with 
duplex DNA containing pur operator sequences varied at position 8 were 
investigated crystallographically, and binding studies were performed using 
fluorescence anisotropy. The structures of the protein-DNA complexes reveal a 
relatively unperturbed global conformation regardless of the identity of the 
base-pair at position 8 or residue 55. In all structures the combination of 
higher resolution and a palindromic purF operator site allowed several new 
PurR.DNA interactions to be observed, including contacts by Thr15, Thr16 and 
His20. The side-chain of Lys55 makes productive, though varying, interactions 
with the adenine, thymine or cytosine base at position 8 that result in 
equilibrium dissociation constants of 2.6 nM, 10 nM and 35 nM, respectively. 
However, the bulk of the lysine side-chain apparently blocks high-affinity 
binding of operators with guanine at position 8 (Kd620 nM). Also, the 
high-affinity binding conformation appears blocked, as crystals of WT bound to 
DNA with guanine at position 8 could not be grown. In complexes containing K55A, 
the alanine side-chain is too far removed to engage in van der Waals 
interactions with the operator, and, with the loss of the general electrostatic 
interaction between the phosphate backbone and the ammonium group of lysine, 
K55A binds each operator weakly. However, the mutation leads to a swap of 
specificity of PurR for the base at position 8, with K55A exhibiting a twofold 
preference for guanine over adenine. In addition to defining the role of Lys55 
in PurR minor groove binding, these studies provide structural insight into the 
minor groove binding specificities of other LacI/GalR family members that have 
either alanine (e.g. LacI, GalR, CcpA) or a basic residue (e.g. RafR, ScrR, 
RbtR) at the comparable position.

Escherichia coli gene purR encoding a repressor protein for purine nucleotide

The Escherichia coli gene purR, encoding a repressor protein, was cloned by 
complementation of a purR mutation. Gene purR on a multicopy plasmid repressed 
expression of purF and purF-lacZ and reduced the growth rate of host cells by 
limiting the rate of de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. The level of a 
1.3-kilobase purR mRNA was higher in cells grown with excess adenine, suggesting 
that synthesis of the repressor may be regulated. The chromosomal locus of purR 
was mapped to coordinate 1755-kb on the E. coli restriction map (Kohara, Y., 
Akiyama, K., and Isono, K. (1987) Cell 50, 495-508). Pur repressor bound 
specifically to purF operator DNA as determined by gel retardation and DNase I 
footprinting assays. The amino acid sequence of Pur repressor was derived from 
the nucleotide sequence. Pur repressor subunit contains 341 amino acids and has 
a calculated Mr of 38,179. Pur repressor is 31-35% identical with the galR and 
cytR repressors and 26% identical with the lacI repressor. These four repressors 
are likely homologous. Amino acid sequence similarity is greatest in an 
amino-terminal region presumed to contain a DNA-binding domain. A similarity is 
also noted in the operator sites for these repressors.

Nucleotide sequence, function, activation, and evolution of the cryptic asc

Hall BG(1), Xu L.

(1)Biology Department, University of Rochester, New York 14627.

The cryptic asc (previous called "SAC") operon of Escherichia coli K12 has been 
completely sequenced. It encodes a repressor (ascG); a PTS enzyme IIasc for the 
transport of arbutin, salicin, and cellobiose (ascF); and a 
phospho-beta-glucosidase that hydrolyzes the sugars which are phosphorylated 
during transport (ascB). ascG and ascFB are transcribed from divergent 
promoters. The cryptic operon is activated by the insertion of IS186 into the 
ascG (repressor) gene. The ascFB genes are paralogous to the cryptic bglFB 
genes, and ascG is paralogous to galR. The duplications that gave rise to these 
paralogous genes are estimated to have occurred approximately 320 Mya, a time 
that predates the divergence of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium.

Repression and activation of arginine transport genes in Escherichia coli K 12 
by the ArgP protein.

In Escherichia coli K 12, arginine modulates the functioning of the arginine 
transport system. Cells grown in the presence of arginine show a 60 % reduction 
in the active incorporation of radioactive arginine. This regulation of arginine 
transport is independent of the regulation of arginine biosynthesis. Previously, 
a mutant was isolated with a 90 % reduction of arginine transport. The mutation 
affected also the transport of ornithine and lysine. It was mapped and assigned 
to a locus named argP at minute 65 of the E. coli linkage map. Genetic studies 
showed that in argP/argP(+) merodiploids, the mutated argP allele is dominant. 
The argP(+) gene was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the sequenced gene 
revealed that it is identical with iciA, an E. coli gene that encodes an 
inhibitor of chromosomal initiation of replication in vitro. The sequence 
analysis of the mutated argP gene identified a single mutation that led to the 
substitution of proline for serine in the C-terminal domain of the ArgP protein. 
This protein has homology with a large group of prokaryotic regulatory proteins 
known as the LysR family. Proteins from this family have been shown to function 
as transcriptional regulators. Here, it is shown that the ArgP protein activates 
the formation of the ArgK protein, an ATP-binding protein essential for the 
operation of the arginine transport system. In the presence of L-arginine, ArgP 
inhibits its own synthesis.

The replication origin of Escherichia coli (oriC) was probed for specific 
binding proteins, using the gel shift assay. A 33-kDa protein that binds 
specifically to the right border of oriC, next to the rightmost of the binding 
sites of the initiator protein, DnaA, was identified and purified. The 
stoichiometry of protein to DNA is about 6 to 1. Around 5000 monomers of the 
protein, named Rob (right oriC binding), are present per cell. The rob gene has 
been located near 99.8 min on the E. coli map, cloned, and overexpressed. The 
total protein sequence reveals strong homologies to several regulatory proteins 
with which it shares the helix-turn-helix motif.

The gene encoding the protein that binds the three 13-mers in the origin (oriC) 
of Escherichia coli to block initiation of replication in vitro has been cloned, 
sequenced, and overexpressed. The gene possesses an open reading frame for 297 
amino acids (mass of 33,471 Da). The protein has a motif for DNA-binding 
(helix-turn-helix) and has homology to a diverse set of prokaryotic regulatory 
proteins, known as the LysR family. The protein, previously referred to as the 
33-kDa protein, has been named IciA (for inhibitor of chromosome initiation). 
The iciA gene is at 62.8 min on the chromosomal map. Cells with enhanced levels 
of the protein grow at a normal rate but generally exhibit a pronounced lag upon 
transfer to a fresh medium.

Properties of an Escherichia coli K-12 mutant defective in the transport of 
arginine and ornithine.

Celis TF.

A canavanine-resistant mutant strain, defective in the transport of arginine and 
ornithine, was isolated and characterized. Experiments presented show that both 
the kinetics of influx and the steady state of accumulation of arginine and 
ornithine are affected by the mutation, whereas the activity of other related 
transport systems remains unchanged. On the basis of competitive studies, it is 
concluded that L-canavanine can inhibit efficiently the arginine-specific uptake 
system. D-Arginine appears to be a moderate inhibitor. None of the basic amino 
acid-binding proteins of the mutant strain showed detectable alterations in 
terms of quantity, physical properties, or affinity constants. Studies on the 
relationship between the number of transport carriers and the steady state of 
accumulation of arginine suggested the presence of a reduced number of membrane 
carriers in the mutant strain. It is proposed that the mutation affects a 
regulatory gene concerned with controlling the amount of membrane carriers 
produced, which are components of the arginine- and ornithine-specific uptake 
systems. The mutation maps at min 62 on the recalibrated linkage map of 
Escherichia coli K-12, in a locus closely linked or identical to argP.

Basic amino acid transport in Escherichia coli: properties of 
canavanine-resistant mutants.

Rosen BP.

A mutant of Escherichia coli strain CanR 22 has been isolated which is resistant 
to growth inhibition by canavanine, an analogue of arginine. The properties of 
this strain and of another canavanine-resistant mutant, JC182-5 (isolated by 
Celis et al. [5]), were studied. The mutation is pleiotropic in that it results 
in a reduction in the activity of two distinct permeases, the arginine-specific 
and lysine-arginine-ornithine transport systems. The lesion maps at min 56 of 
the E. coli linkage map, at or near the argP locus. Although strain CanR 22 
excretes arginine, this excretion appears to result from reduced ability to 
concentrate arginine, rather than the loss of transport ability being the result 
of excretion. This conclusion is based on findings with a canavanine-resistant 
strain auxotrophic for arginine, which exhibits transport properties similar to 
those of the prototrophic strains. Additionally, growth in the presence of 
arginine or ornithine results in a repression of the activity of the two basic 
amino acid transport systems. Neither the arginine-specific nor the 
lysine-arginine-ornithine binding proteins of the mutant cells show significant 
alterations in terms of amount, physical properties, or kinetic parameters. 
These observations lead to the proposal of a model for the two basic amino acid 
transport systems in which two carrier proteins with different specificities 
interact with a common energy coupling mechanism. A lesion in the gene (or one 
of the genes) for this coupling mechanism can confer canavanine resistance.

Genome-wide analysis of the PreA/PreB (QseB/QseC) regulon of Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium.

BACKGROUND: The Salmonella PreA/PreB two-component system (TCS) is an ortholog 
of the QseBC TCS of Escherichia coli. In both Salmonella and E. coli, this 
system has been shown to affect motility and virulence in response to 
quorum-sensing and hormonal signals, and to affect the transcription of the 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) pmrAB operon, which 
encodes an important virulence-associated TCS.
RESULTS: To determine the PreA/PreB regulon in S. Typhimurium, we performed DNA 
microarrays comparing the wild type strain and various preA and/or preB mutants 
in the presence of ectopically expressed preA (qseB). These data confirmed our 
previous findings of the negative effect of PreB on PreA gene regulation and 
identified candidate PreA-regulated genes. A proportion of the activated loci 
were previously identified as PmrA-activated genes (yibD, pmrAB, cptA, etc.) or 
were genes located in the local region around preA, including the preAB operon. 
The transcriptional units were defined in this local region by RT-PCR, 
suggesting three PreA activated operons composed of preA-preB, mdaB-ygiN, and 
ygiW-STM3175. Several putative virulence-related phenotypes were examined for 
preAB mutants, resulting in the observation of a host cell invasion and slight 
virulence defect of a preAB mutant. Contrary to previous reports on this TCS, we 
were unable to show a PreA/PreB-dependent effect of the quorum-sensing signal 
AI-2 or of epinephrine on S. Typhimurium with regard to bacterial motility.
CONCLUSION: This work further characterizes this unorthadox OmpR/EnvZ class TCS 
and provides novel candidate regulated genes for further study. This first 
in-depth study of the PreA/PreB regulatory system phenotypes and regulation 
suggests significant comparative differences to the reported function of the 
orthologous QseB/QseC in E. coli.

QseB/QseC is a two-component system that is involved in the regulation of 
multiple bacterial behaviors by regulating quorum sensing, bacterial 
pathogenicity, and antibiotic resistance. Thus, QseB/QseC could provide a target 
for new antibiotic development. Recently, QseB/QseC has been found to confer 
survival advantages to environmental bacteria under stress conditions. The 
molecular mechanistic understanding of QseB/QseC has become an active area of 
research and revealed some emerging themes, including a deeper understanding of 
QseB/QseC regulation in different pathogens and environmental bacteria, the 
functional difference of QseB/QseC among species, and the possibility of 
analyzing QseB/QseC evolution. Here, we discuss the progression of QseB/QseC 
studies and describe several unresolved issues and future directions. Resolving 
these issues is among the challenges of future QseB/QseC studies.

In enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), the production of flagella and the 
type III secretion system (T3SS) is activated in the presence of host cultured 
epithelial cells. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship 
between expression of flagella and the T3SS. Mutants deficient in assembling 
T3SS basal and translocon components (ΔespA, ΔespB, ΔespD, ΔescC, ΔescN, and 
ΔescV), and in secreting effector molecules (ΔsepD and ΔsepL) were tested for 
flagella production under several growth conditions. The ΔespA mutant did not 
produce flagella in any condition tested, although fliC was transcribed. The 
remaining mutants produced different levels of flagella upon growth in LB or in 
the presence of cells but were significantly diminished in flagella production 
after growth in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium. We also investigated the 
role of virulence and global regulator genes in expression of flagella. The 
ΔqseB and ΔqseC mutants produced abundant flagella only when growing in LB and 
in the presence of HeLa cells, indicating that QseB and QseC act as negative 
regulators of fliC transcription. The ΔgrlR, ΔperA, Δler, Δhns, and Δfis mutants 
produced low levels of flagella, suggesting these regulators are activators of 
fliC expression. These data suggest that the presence of an intact T3SS is 
required for assembly of flagella highlighting the existence in EPEC of a 
cross-talk between these two virulence-associated T3SSs.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular characterization 
of NDM-1-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex (CREL) at a 
teaching hospital in Chongqing, China.
METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance genes were analyzed. 
Epidemiological relationship was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
(PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Conjugation experiments were 
performed to determine the transferability of plasmids. Whole-genome sequencing 
(WGS) of strains was implemented, and the genetic environment of the bla NDM-1- 
and mcr-9-carrying plasmids was analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 10 bla NDM-1-positive CREL isolates were identified. All 
isolates harbored multiple resistance genes. ECL68 and ECL78 co-produce bla 
NDM-1 and mcr-9. Among the four different sequence types (STs) detected, ST1466 
was assigned as a novel ST. Six isolates exhibited highly similar PFGE patterns. 
Conjugation assay proved that all plasmids containing bla NDM-1 or mcr-9 could 
be transferred to the recipient Escherichia coli. WGS indicated that bla NDM-1 
genes were carried by diverse plasmids, including IncHI2/IncN, IncX3, and one 
unclassified plasmid type. The backbone structure of these plasmids is involved 
in replication initiation (repAB), partitioning (parABM), and conjugation/type 
IV secretion (tra/virB). Analysis of the genetic environment showed that bla 
NDM-1 in three plasmids exhibited a highly similar structure to protype Tn125. 
Co-existence of bla NDM-1 and the colistin resistance gene mcr-9 was detected in 
the two isolates, ECL68 and ECL78. In ECL68, bla NDM-1 and mcr-9 were present on 
the same plasmid while located in two separate plasmids in ECL78. The genetic 
environment of mcr-9 was organized as IS26-wbuC-mcr-9-IS903-pcoS-pcoE-rcnA-rcnR, 
and the two-component system encoding genes qseC and qseB was not found in two 
plasmids, which could explain mcr-9-harboring strains' colistin susceptibility.
CONCLUSIONS: We first report a nosocomial outbreak of NDM-1-producing E. cloacae 
complex ST177 in China. Conjugative plasmids contributed to the horizontal 
transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. The prevalence and even coexistence of 
bla NDM-1 and mcr-9 may further threaten public health. Our results highlight 
further surveillance for bla NDM-1, and mcr-9 is essential to prevent its 
dissemination.

Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is an evolving infectious pathogen 
associated with high mortality. The convergence of hypervirulence and multidrug 
resistance further challenges the clinical treatment options for K. pneumoniae 
infections. The QseBC two-component system (TCS) is a component of 
quorum-sensing regulatory cascade and functions as a global regulator of biofilm 
growth, bacterial motility, and virulence in Escherichia coli. However, the 
functional mechanisms of QseBC in hvKP have not been reported, and we aim to 
examine the role of QseBC in regulating virulence in hvKP strain ATCC43816. The 
CRISPR-Cas9 system was used to construct qseB, qseC, and qseBC knockout in 
ATCC43816. No significant alterations in the growth and antibiotic 
susceptibility were detected between wild-type and mutants. The deletion of qseC 
led to an increase of biofilm formation, resistance to serum killing, and high 
mortality in the G. mellonella model. RNAseq differential gene expression 
analysis exhibited that gene-associated biofilm formation (glgC, glgP, glgA, 
gcvA, bcsA, ydaM, paaF, ptsG), bacterial type VI secretion system (virB4, virB6, 
virB10, vgrG, hcp), and biosynthesis of siderophore (entC, entD, entE) were 
significantly upregulated in comparison with the wild-type control. In addition, 
qseB, ygiW (encode OB-family protein), and AraC family transcriptional regulator 
IT767_23090 genes showed highest expressions in the absence of QseC, which might 
be related to increased virulence. The study provided new insights into the 
functional importance of QseBC in regulating the virulence of hvKP.

The Escherichia coli QseB/QseC signaling regulates expressions of more than 50 
genes encoding flagellar proteins and proteins associated with virulence. Here 
we found that absence of the QseB/QseC signaling led to an early initiation of 
chromosomal replication and higher concentration of DnaA which is initiator for 
replication. The upstream region of dnaA promoter contains three potential QseB 
binding sites and absence of these binding sites increased transcription of the 
dnaA gene in wild-type cells but not in the cells lacking the qseB/qseC genes, 
showing that the QseB/QseC signaling regulates dnaA expression through the QseB 
binding sites. Also increased cell motility but neither cell size nor growth 
rate in ΔqseBC and ΔqseB cells was observed and these effects were reversed by 
ectopic expression of QseBC. Further, it was found that QseB interacted with the 
DnaK chaperone and FtsZ cell division protein in vivo, and absence of DnaK or 
partial inactivation of FtsZ decreased cell motility. Thus, we conclude that the 
QseB/QseC signaling modulates timing of replication initiation by regulating 
expression of DnaA, coordinates cell motility with cell division through 
interacting with the DnaK and FtsZ protein.

A genetic screen to identify factors affected by undecaprenyl phosphate 
recycling uncovers novel connections to morphogenesis in Escherichia coli.

Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.

Undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P) is an essential lipid carrier that ferries cell 
wall intermediates across the cytoplasmic membrane in bacteria. Und-P is 
generated by dephosphorylating undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (Und-PP). In 
Escherichia coli, BacA, PgpB, YbjG, and LpxT dephosphorylate Und-PP and are 
conditionally essential. To identify vulnerabilities that arise when Und-P 
metabolism is defective, we developed a genetic screen for synthetic 
interactions which, in combination with ΔybjG ΔlpxT ΔbacA, are lethal or reduce 
fitness. The screen uncovered novel connections to cell division, DNA 
replication/repair, signal transduction, and glutathione metabolism. Further 
analysis revealed several new morphogenes; loss of one of these, qseC, caused 
cells to enlarge and lyse. QseC is the sensor kinase component of the QseBC 
two-component system. Loss of QseC causes overactivation of the QseB response 
regulator by PmrB cross-phosphorylation. Here, we show that deleting qseB 
completely reverses the shape defect of ΔqseC cells, as does overexpressing rprA 
(a small RNA). Surprisingly, deleting pmrB only partially suppressed 
qseC-related shape defects. Thus, QseB is activated by multiple factors in 
QseC's absence and prior functions ascribed to QseBC may originate from cell 
wall defects. Altogether, our findings provide a framework for identifying new 
determinants of cell integrity that could be targeted in future therapies.

The gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila, the 
causative agent of motile aeromonad septicaemia, has attracted increasing 
attention due to its high pathogenicity. Here, we constructed the complete 
genome sequence of a virulent strain, A. hydrophila HX-3 isolated from 
Pseudosciaena crocea and performed comparative genomics to investigate its 
virulence factors and quorum sensing features in comparison with those of other 
Aeromonas isolates. HX-3 has a circular chromosome of 4,941,513 bp with a 61.0% 
G + C content encoding 4483 genes, including 4318 protein-coding genes, and 31 
rRNA, 127 tRNA and 7 ncRNA operons. Seventy interspersed repeat and 153 tandem 
repeat sequences, 7 transposons, 8 clustered regularly interspaced short 
palindromic repeats, and 39 genomic islands were predicted in the A. hydrophila 
HX-3 genome. Phylogeny and pan-genome were also analyzed herein to confirm the 
evolutionary relationships on the basis of comparisons with other fully 
sequenced Aeromonas genomes. In addition, the assembled HX-3 genome was 
successfully annotated against the Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins 
database (76.03%), Gene Ontology database (18.13%), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genome pathway database (59.68%). Two-component regulatory systems in 
the HX-3 genome and virulence factors profiles through comparative analysis were 
predicted, providing insights into pathogenicity. A large number of genes 
related to the AHL-type 1 (ahyI, ahyR), LuxS-type 2 (luxS, pfs, metEHK, litR, 
luxOQU) and QseBC-type 3 (qseB, qseC) autoinducer systems were also identified. 
As a result of the expression of the ahyI gene in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), 
combined UPLC-MS/MS profiling led to the identification of several new 
N-acyl-homoserine lactone compounds synthesized by AhyI. This genomic analysis 
determined the comprehensive QS systems of A. hydrophila, which might provide

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Trace amines (TA) are small organic compounds that have 
neuromodulator activity due to their interaction with some neuron-related 
receptors, such as trace amine associated receptors (TAARs), α2-adrenergic 
receptor (α2-AR) and ß-adrenergic receptor (ß-AR). However, there is little 
information on whether TA and dopamine (DOP) can interact with other adrenergic 
receptors (ARs) such as the mammalian α1-AR and the bacterial counterpart QseC, 
which is involved in quorum sensing of some Gram-negative pathogens. The aim of 
this study was to investigate the interaction of TA and DOP with α1-AR and QseC.
METHODS: We performed an in silico study using 3D structure from SWISS MODEL and 
analyzed the protein interaction via molecular docking using PyMol, PoseView and 
PyRX 8.0. For the in vitro study, we investigated the QseC kinase activity by 
measuring the remaining ATP in a reaction containing QseC-enriched membrane 
incubated together with purified QseB and EPI, TA, DOP, or PTL respectively. We 
also measured the intracellular Ca++ levels, which represents the α1-AR 
activation, in LNCAP (pancreatic cell line) cells treated with EPI, TA, DOP and 
PTL respectively using a fluorescence-based assay. The LNCAP cell proliferation 
was measured using an MTT-based assay.
RESULTS: Our in silico analysis revealed that TAs and DOP have high binding 
affinity to the human α1-AR and the bacterial adrenergic receptor (QseC), 
comparable to epinephrine (EPI). Both are membrane-bound kinases. Experimental 
studies with pancreatic cell line (LNCAP) showed that the TAs and DOP act as 
α1-AR antagonist by counteracting the effect of EPI. In the presence of EPI, TA 
and DOP trigger an increase of the intracellular Ca++ levels in the LNCAP cells 
leading to an inhibition of cell proliferation. Although in silico data suggest 
an interaction of TA and DOP with QseC, they do not inhibit the kinase activity 
of QseC, a histidine kinase receptor involved in quorum sensing which is also 
sensitive to EPI.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the TAs and DOP act as α1-AR antagonist but no 
effect was observed for QseC.

Colistin is an important antibiotic currently used to manage infections caused 
by multidrug-resistant pathogens in both humans and livestock animals. A new 
mobile colistin-resistance (mcr-9) gene was recently discovered; this discovery 
highlighted the need for rigorous monitoring of bacterial resistance against 
colistin. Salmonella is one of the major pathogens responsible for foodborne 
illnesses; however, there is minimal information regarding the presence of mcr 
genes in foodborne Salmonella strains. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the presence of mcr genes among 178 Salmonella strains isolated from chicken 
meat in Korea. Antimicrobial susceptibility was measured using the broth 
microdilution method. Bioinformatics characterization of colistin-resistant 
strains and genetic environment of the mcr-9 gene were analyzed using 
next-generation sequencing. Transferability of the mcr-9 carrying 
colistin-resistant Salmonella strain was tested using broth-mating conjugation. 
Thirteen of the 178 Salmonella isolates showed colistin resistance, but only one 
strain, Salmonella Dessau ST14 (KUFSE-SAL043) from a traditional chicken market 
in Korea, carried an mcr family gene, mcr-9. This strain also carried other 
acquired antimicrobial resistance genes such as blaTEM-1B, qnrS1, and 
aac(6')-Iaa. Only the IncX1 plasmid replicon type was detected in this strain. 
In the strain KUFSE-SAL043, the mcr-9 gene was located between two insertion 
sequences, IS903B and IS26, followed by the downstream regulatory genes 
qseB-like and qseC-like, which were located between IS1R and ΔIS1R. Conjugation 
tests revealed that the mcr-9 gene was successfully transferred to Escherichia 
coli J53 at a mean frequency of 2.03 × 10-7. This is the first report of a 
transferable mcr-9 gene in Salmonella isolated from chicken meat in Korea, 
highlighting the possibility of transfer of colistin resistance. Therefore, the 
wide use of colistin should be reconsidered, and a One Health perspective should 
be adopted to monitor the antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacteriaceae strains 
in humans, livestock, and the environment.

The extensively drug-resistant NDM-1-producing Klebsiella quasipneumoniae subsp. 
quasipneumoniae M17277 (Kqsq-M17277) was only susceptible to colistin and 
fosfomycin. Whole genome sequencing of Kqsq-M17277 was performed through 
Illumina (short reads) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (long reads). Hybrid 
assembly of short and long reads rendered circular contigs of the Kqsq-M17277 
chromosome and three plasmids of 477,340 (p17277A_477), 138,998 (p17277C_138, 
which harbored blaNDM-1) and 123,307 bp (p17277B_123). In silico analysis showed 
that p17277A_477 was not previously described, belonged to the IncHI2 
incompatibility group and contained 51 complete or partial (≥300 bp) insertion 
sequences and Tn3 family transposons, which encompassed, as a whole, 14% of the 
p17277A_477 sequence. In silico search for antimicrobial resistance genes 
revealed that p17277A_477 harbored the recently described plasmid-encoded mcr-9 
gene (colistin resistance), besides other resistance genes. This is the first 
worldwide report of a K. quasipneumoniae harboring mcr-9 and blaNDM-1 and the 
first report of mcr-9 in Latin America. This gene was embedded in a genetic 
structure, i.e., IS903B-like/mcr-9/wbuC/IS26, that was found in 71% of the 
mcr-9-harboring sequences of the NCBI Nucleotide Collection database. The qseC 
and qseB genes involved in mcr-9 expression were not found in Kqsq-M17277, which 
could explain its colistin susceptibility. Fifteen additional resistance genes 
were detected in p17277A_477. Ten of them [aac(6')-IIc, aadA2, aph(3')-Ia, 
blaDHA-1, dfrA12, ereA2, mphA, qnrB4, sul1 and tet(D)] were found clustered 
within a 44,907-bp-long array of IS26-bounded resistance genes. The 
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene qnrB4 was located in a complex class 
1 integron within this IS26-bounded resistance gene cluster. p17277A_477 was 
self-transferable by conjugation to Escherichia coli J53, azide-resistant. The 
Tra1 and Tra2 conjugative transfer regions of the IncHI2 plasmid R478 were found 
by in silico search. p17277A_477 is a complex plasmid that provides a large 
baggage of both resistance genes and genetic resources for plasmid 
rearrangements and additional resistance gene acquisition.

In E. coli, sigmaE-dependent transcription is controlled by 
regulated-proteolysis of RseA. RseA, which holds sigmaE as an anti-sigma factor, 
is sequentially digested by DegS, RseP and cytoplasmic proteases to liberate 
sigmaE in response to dysfunction in outer-membrane biogenesis. Additionally, 
the sequential proteolysis is regulated by RseB binding to RseA (Fig. 1A). 
Direct interaction between RseA and RseB inhibits RseA-cleavage by DegS. Both 
proteolytic activation of DegS and binding disruption of RseB are thus required 
to initiate sigmaE-stress response. For the induction of sigmaEstress response, 
DegS and RseB recognize the states of OMP and LPS for outer-membrane biogenesis. 
DegS is activated by binding of unfolded OMPs and RseB binding to RseA is 
antagonized by LPS accumulated in periplasm. In this regard, DegS and RseB are 
proposed to be stress sensor proteins for sigmaE signal transduction. 
Interestingly, biogenesis of OMP and LPS appears to cross-talk with each other, 
indicating that dysfunction of either OMP or LPS can initiate RseA proteolysis. 
This review aims to briefly introduce two stress sensor proteins, DegS and RseB, 
which regulate sigmaEdependent transcription.

In Escherichia coli, the σ(E) transcription factor monitors and maintains outer 
membrane (OM) integrity by activating genes required for assembly of its two key 
components, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by 
transcribing small RNAs to down-regulate excess unassembled OMPs. σ(E) activity 
is governed by the rate of degradation of its membrane-spanning anti-σ factor, 
RseA. Importantly, the DegS protease can initiate RseA cleavage only when 
activated by binding to unassembled OMPs. The prevalent paradigm has been that 
the σ(E) response is controlled by the amount of activated DegS. Here we 
demonstrate that inactivation of a second negative regulator, the periplasmic 
protein RseB, is also required for σ(E) induction in vivo. Moreover, OMPs, 
previously known only to activate DegS, also generate a signal to antagonize 
RseB inhibition. This signal may be lipid related, as RseB is structurally 
similar to proteins that bind lipids. We propose that the use of an AND gate 
enables σ(E) to sense and integrate multivariate signals from the envelope.

Structural basis for the negative regulation of bacterial stress response by 
RseB.

Medicine, Suwon 440-746, Korea.

The sigmaE-dependent stress response in bacterial cells is initiated by the 
DegS- and RseP-regulated intramembrane proteolysis of a membrane-spanning 
antisigma factor, RseA. RseB binds to RseA and inhibits its sequential cleavage, 
thereby functioning as a negative modulator of this response. In the crystal 
structure of the periplasmic domain of RseA bound to RseB, the DegS cleavage 
site of RseA is unstructured, however, its P1 residue is buried in the 
hydrophobic pocket of RseB, which suggests that RseB binding blocks the access 
of DegS to the cleavage site.

Inhibition of regulated proteolysis by RseB.

The Escherichia coli envelope-stress response is a sensor system that increases 
transcription of stress genes in the cytoplasm when misfolded porins are 
detected in the periplasm. This response is initiated by DegS cleavage of the 
periplasmic domain of RseA, a transmembrane protein. Additional proteolysis of 
transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions of RseA then frees the sigma(E) 
transcription factor, which directs the transcriptional response. We show that 
RseB protein, a known negative regulator, inhibits proteolysis by DegS in vitro 
by binding tightly to the periplasmic domain of RseA. Inhibition of DegS 
cleavage requires RseB binding to a conserved region near the C terminus of the 
poorly structured RseA domain, but the RseA sequences that mediate DegS 
recognition and RseB binding do not overlap directly. Although DegS cleavage of 
RseA is normally activated by binding of the C termini of porins to the PDZ 
domain of DegS, RseB inhibition is independent of this activation mechanism.

Sensing external stress in the bacterial periplasm and signal transduction to 
the cytoplasm are important functions of the CpxAR, Bae and sigma(E) signalling 
pathways. In Escherichia coli, the sigma(E) pathway can be activated through 
degradation of the antisigma factor RseA by DegS and YaeL. The periplasmic 
protein RseB plays an important role in this pathway by exerting a direct or 
indirect negative effect on YaeL cleavage efficiency. RseB from E. coli, missing 
the periplasmic signal sequence (RseB(DeltaN)), was cloned, expressed, purified 
and crystallized. Crystals were obtained in two different forms belonging to 
space group P42(1)2 (form I) and C222(1) (form II) and diffracted to 2.8 and 2.4 
A resolution, respectively. In crystal form I two copies of the protein were 
located in the asymmetric unit according to heavy-atom analysis, while crystal 
form II contained three copies.

Proteolytic cascades are widely implicated in signaling between cellular 
compartments. In Escherichia coli, accumulation of unassembled outer membrane 
porins (OMPs) in the envelope leads to expression of sigma(E)-dependent genes in 
the cytoplasmic cellular compartment. A proteolytic cascade conveys the OMP 
signal by regulated proteolysis of RseA, a membrane-spanning anti-sigma factor 
whose cytoplasmic domain inhibits sigma(E)-dependent transcription. Upon 
activation by OMP C termini, the membrane localized DegS protease cleaves RseA 
in its periplasmic domain, the membrane-embedded protease RseP (YaeL) cleaves 
RseA near the inner membrane, and the released cytoplasmic RseA fragment is 
further degraded. Initiation of RseA degradation by activated DegS makes the 
system sensitive to a wide range of OMP concentrations and unresponsive to 
variations in the levels of DegS and RseP proteases. These features rely on the 
inability of RseP to cleave intact RseA. In the present report, we demonstrate 
that RseB, which binds to the periplasmic face of RseA, and DegS each 
independently inhibits RseP cleavage of intact RseA. Thus, the function of RseB, 
widely conserved among bacteria using the sigma(E) pathway, and the second role 
of DegS (in addition to RseA proteolysis initiation) is to improve the 
performance characteristics of this signal transduction system.

Regulation of the Escherichia coli sigma-dependent envelope stress response.

Author information:

Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143-2200, USA.

The Escherichia colisigma(E)-dependent stress response pathway controls the 
expression of genes encoding periplasmic folding catalysts, proteases, 
biosynthesis enzymes for lipid A (a component of lipopolysaccharide or LPS) and 
other proteins known or predicted to function in or produce components of the 
envelope. When E. coli is subjected to heat or other stresses that generate 
unfolded envelope proteins, sigma(E) activity is induced. Four key players in 
this signal transduction pathway have been identified: RseA, an inner membrane 
sigma(E) antisigma factor; RseB, a periplasmic protein that binds to the 
periplasmic face of RseA; and the DegS and YaeL proteases. The major point of 
regulation, the interaction between sigma(E) and RseA, is primarily controlled 
by the stability of RseA. Envelope stress promotes RseA degradation, which 
occurs by a proteolytic cascade initiated by DegS. There is evidence that one 
sigma(E)-inducing stress (OmpC overexpression) directly activates DegS to cleave 
RseA. Secondarily, envelope stress may relieve RseB-mediated enhancement of RseA 
activity. Additional levels of control upon sigma(E) activity may become evident 
upon further study of this stress response pathway.

Involvement of a Membrane-Bound Amphiphilic Helix in Substrate Discrimination 
and Binding by an Escherichia coli S2P Peptidase RseP.

Japan.

Intramembrane proteases (IMPs) are a unique class of proteases that catalyze the 
proteolysis within the membrane and regulate diverse cellular processes in 
various organisms. RseP, an Escherichia coli site-2 protease (S2P) family IMP, 
is involved in the regulation of an extracytoplasmic stress response through the 
cleavage of membrane-spanning anti-stress-response transcription factor 
(anti-σE) protein RseA. Extracytoplasmic stresses trigger a sequential cleavage 
of RseA, in which first DegS cleaves off its periplasmic domain, and RseP 
catalyzes the second cleavage of RseA. The two tandem-arranged periplasmic PDZ 
(PDZ tandem) domains of RseP serve as a size-exclusion filter which prevents the 
access of an intact RseA into the active site of RseP IMP domain. However, 
RseP's substrate recognition mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we found 
that a periplasmic region of RseP, located downstream of the PDZ tandem, 
contains a segment (named H1) predicted to form an amphiphilic helix. Bacterial 
S2P homologs with various numbers of PDZ domains have a similar amphiphilic 
helix in the corresponding region. We demonstrated that the H1 segment forms a 
partially membrane-embedded amphiphilic helix on the periplasmic surface of the 
membrane. Systematic and random mutagenesis analyses revealed that the H1 helix 
is important for the stability and proteolytic function of RseP and that 
mutations in the H1 segment can affect the PDZ-mediated substrate 
discrimination. Cross-linking experiments suggested that H1 directly interacts 
with the DegS-cleaved form of RseA. We propose that H1 acts as an adaptor 
required for proper arrangement of the PDZ tandem domain to perform its filter 
function and for substrate positioning for its efficient cleavage.

In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic protease DegP plays a critical role in 
degrading misfolded outer membrane proteins (OMPs). Consequently, mutants 
lacking DegP display a temperature-sensitive growth defect, presumably due to 
the toxic accumulation of misfolded OMPs. The Tol-Pal complex plays a poorly 
defined but an important role in envelope biogenesis, since mutants defective in 
this complex display a classical periplasmic leakage phenotype. Double mutants 
lacking DegP and an intact Tol-Pal complex display exaggerated 
temperature-sensitive growth defects and the leaky phenotype. Two revertants 
that overcome the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype carry missense 
mutations in the degS gene, resulting in D102V and D320A substitutions. D320 and 
E317 of the PDZ domain of DegS make salt bridges with R178 of DegS's protease 
domain to keep the protease in the inactive state. However, weakening of the 
tripartite interactions by D320A increases DegS's basal protease activity. 
Although the D102V substitution is as effective as D320A in suppressing the 
temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, the molecular mechanism behind its 
effect on DegS's protease activity is unclear. Our data suggest that the two 
DegS variants modestly activate RseA-controlled, σE-mediated envelope stress 
response pathway and elevate periplasmic protease activity to restore envelope 
homeostasis. Based on the release of a cytoplasmic enzyme in the culture 
supernatant, we conclude that the conditional lethal phenotype of ΔtolB ΔdegP 
mutants stems from a grossly destabilized envelope structure that causes 
excessive cell lysis. Together, the data point to a critical role for 
periplasmic proteases when the Tol-Pal complex-mediated envelope structure 
and/or functions are compromised.IMPORTANCE The Tol-Pal complex plays a poorly 
defined role in envelope biogenesis. The data presented here show that DegP's 
periplasmic protease activity becomes crucial in mutants lacking the intact 
Tol-Pal complex, but this requirement can be circumvented by suppressor 
mutations that activate the basal protease activity of a regulatory protease,

The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria forms a robust permeability 
barrier that blocks entry of toxins and antibiotics. Most OM proteins (OMPs) 
assume a β-barrel fold, and some form aqueous channels for nutrient uptake and 
efflux of intracellular toxins. The Bam machine catalyzes rapid folding and 
assembly of OMPs. Fidelity of OMP biogenesis is monitored by the σE stress 
response. When OMP folding defects arise, the proteases DegS and RseP act 
sequentially to liberate σE into the cytosol, enabling it to activate 
transcription of the stress regulon. Here, we identify batimastat as a selective 
inhibitor of RseP that causes a lethal decrease in σE activity in Escherichia 
coli, and we further identify RseP mutants that are insensitive to inhibition 
and confer resistance. Remarkably, batimastat treatment allows the capture of 
elusive intermediates in the OMP biogenesis pathway and offers opportunities to 
better understand the underlying basis for σE essentiality.

In E. coli, sigmaE-dependent transcription is controlled by 
regulated-proteolysis of RseA. RseA, which holds sigmaE as an anti-sigma factor, 
is sequentially digested by DegS, RseP and cytoplasmic proteases to liberate 
sigmaE in response to dysfunction in outer-membrane biogenesis. Additionally, 
the sequential proteolysis is regulated by RseB binding to RseA (Fig. 1A). 
Direct interaction between RseA and RseB inhibits RseA-cleavage by DegS. Both 
proteolytic activation of DegS and binding disruption of RseB are thus required 
to initiate sigmaE-stress response. For the induction of sigmaEstress response, 
DegS and RseB recognize the states of OMP and LPS for outer-membrane biogenesis. 
DegS is activated by binding of unfolded OMPs and RseB binding to RseA is 
antagonized by LPS accumulated in periplasm. In this regard, DegS and RseB are 
proposed to be stress sensor proteins for sigmaE signal transduction. 
Interestingly, biogenesis of OMP and LPS appears to cross-talk with each other, 
indicating that dysfunction of either OMP or LPS can initiate RseA proteolysis. 
This review aims to briefly introduce two stress sensor proteins, DegS and RseB, 
which regulate sigmaEdependent transcription.

Horizontal gene transfer by conjugation plays a major role in bacterial 
evolution, allowing the acquisition of new traits, such as virulence and 
resistance to antibacterial agents. With the increased antibiotic resistance in 
bacterial pathogens, a better understanding of how bacteria modulate conjugation 
under changing environments and the genetic factors involved is needed. Despite 
the evolutionary advantages conjugation may confer, the process can be quite 
stressful for the donor cell. Here, we characterize the ability of TraR, encoded 
on the episomal F' plasmid, to upregulate the σ(E) extracytoplasmic stress 
pathway in Escherichia coli. TraR, a DksA homolog, modulates transcription 
initiation through the secondary channel of RNA polymerase. We show here that 
TraR activates transcription directly; however, unlike DksA, it does so without 
using ppGpp as a cofactor. TraR expression can stimulate the σ(E) 
extracytoplasmic stress response independently of the DegS/RseA signal 
transduction cascade. In the absence of TraR, bacteria carrying conjugative 
plasmids become more susceptible to external stress. We propose that TraR 
increases the concentrations of periplasmic chaperones and proteases by directly 
activating the transcription of σ(E)-dependent promoters; this increased protein 
folding capacity may prepare the bacterium to endure the periplasmic stress of 
sex pilus biosynthesis during mating.

During the extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli, the 
intramembrane protease RseP cleaves the anti-σ(E) protein RseA only after the 
membrane-anchored protease DegS truncates the periplasmic part of RseA that 
suppresses the action of RseP. Here we analyzed the three-dimensional structure 
of the two tandemly arranged PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains (PDZ tandem) present 
in the periplasmic region of RseP and revealed that the two putative 
ligand-binding grooves constitute a single pocket-like structure that would lie 
just above the active center sequestrated within the membrane. Complete removal 
of the PDZ tandem from RseP led to the intramembrane cleavage of RseA without 
prior truncation by DegS. Furthermore, mutations expected to destabilize the 
tertiary structure of the PDZ tandem also caused the deregulation of the 
sequential cleavage. These observations suggest that the PDZ tandem serves as a 
size-exclusion filter to accommodate the truncated form of RseA into the active 
center.

Regulated proteolysis: control of the Escherichia coli σ(E)-dependent cell 
envelope stress response.

Over the past decade, regulatory proteolysis has emerged as a paradigm for 
transmembrane signal transduction in all organisms, from bacteria to humans. 
These conserved proteolytic pathways share a common design that involves the 
sequential proteolysis of a membrane-bound regulatory protein by two proteases. 
Proteolysis releases the regulator, which is inactive in its membrane-bound 
form, into the cytoplasm where it performs its cellular function. One of the 
best-characterized examples of signal transduction via regulatory proteolysis is 
the pathway governing the σ(E)-dependent cell envelope stress response in 
Escherichia coli. In unstressed cells, σ(E) is sequestered at the membrane by 
the transmembrane anti-sigma factor, RseA. Stresses that compromise the cell 
envelope and interfere with the proper folding of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) 
activate the proteolytic pathway. The C-terminal residues of unfolded OMPs bind 
to the inner membrane protease, DegS, to initiate the proteolytic cascade. DegS 
removes the periplasmic domain of RseA creating a substrate for the next 
protease in the pathway, RseP. RseP cleaves RseA in the periplasmic region in a 
process called regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). The remaining fragment 
of RseA is released into the cytoplasm and fully degraded by the ATP-dependent 
protease, ClpXP, with the assistance of the adaptor protein, SspB, thereby 
freeing σ(E) to reprogram gene expression. A growing body of evidence indicates 
that the overall proteolytic framework that governs the σ(E) response is used to 
regulate similar anti-sigma factor/sigma factor pairs throughout the bacterial 
world and has been adapted to recognize a wide variety of signals and control 
systems as diverse as envelope stress responses, sporulation, virulence, and 
iron-siderophore uptake. In this chapter, we review the extensive physiological, 
biochemical, and structural studies on the σ(E) system that provide remarkable 
insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of this regulated proteolytic signal 
transduction pathway. These studies reveal design principles that are applicable 
to related proteases and regulatory proteolytic pathways in all domains of life.

PDZ domains of RseP are not essential for sequential cleavage of RseA or 
stress-induced σ(E) activation in vivo.

Hizukuri Y(1), Akiyama Y.

Author information:

The Escherichia coli σ(E) extracytoplasmic stress response monitors and responds 
to folding stress in the cell envelope. A protease cascade directed at RseA, a 
membrane-spanning anti-σ that inhibits σ(E) activity, controls this critical 
signal-transduction system. Stress cues activate DegS to cleave RseA; a second 
cleavage by RseP releases RseA from the membrane, enabling its rapid 
degradation. Stress control of proteolysis requires that RseP cleavage is 
dependent on DegS cleavage. Recent in vitro and structural studies found that 
RseP cleavage requires binding of RseP PDZ-C to the newly exposed C-terminal 
residue (Val148) of RseA, generated by DegS cleavage, explaining dependence. We 
tested this mechanism in vivo. Neither mutation in the putative PDZ 
ligand-binding regions nor even deletion of entire RseP PDZ domains had 
significant effects on RseA cleavage in vivo, and the C-terminal residue of 
DegS-processed RseA also little affected RseA cleavage. Indeed, strains with a 
chromosomal rseP gene deleted for either PDZ domain and strains with a 
chromosomal rseA V148 mutation grew normally and exhibited almost normal σ(E) 
activation in response to stress signals. We conclude that recognition of the 
cleaved amino acid by the RseP PDZ domain is not essential for sequential 
cleavage of RseA and σ(E) stress response in vivo.

Reversal of the ΔdegP phenotypes by a novel rpoE allele of Escherichia coli.

RseA sequesters RpoE (σ(E)) to the inner membrane of Escherichia coli when 
envelope stress is low. Elevated envelope stress triggers RseA cleavage by the 
sequential action of two membrane proteases, DegS and RseP, releasing σ(E) to 
activate an envelope stress reducing pathway. Revertants of a ΔdegP ΔbamB 
strain, which fails to grow at 37°C due to high envelope stress, harbored 
mutations in the rseA and rpoE genes. Null and missense rseA mutations 
constitutively hyper-activated the σ(E) regulon and significantly reduced the 
major outer membrane protein (OMP) levels. In contrast, a novel rpoE allele, 
rpoE3, resulting from the partial duplication of the rpoE gene, increased σ(E) 
levels greater than that seen in the rseA mutant background but did not reduce 
OMP levels. A σ(E)-dependent RybB::LacZ construct showed only a weak activation 
of the σ(E) pathway by rpoE3. Despite this, rpoE3 fully reversed the growth and 
envelope vesiculation phenotypes of ΔdegP. Interestingly, rpoE3 also brought 
down the modestly activated Cpx envelope stress pathway in the ΔdegP strain to 
the wild type level, showing the complementary nature of the σ(E) and Cpx 
pathways. Through employing a labile mutant periplasmic protein, AcrA(L222Q), it 
was determined that the rpoE3 mutation overcomes the ΔdegP phenotypes, in part, 
by activating a σ(E)-dependent proteolytic pathway. Our data suggest that a 
reduction in the OMP levels is not intrinsic to the σ(E)-mediated mechanism of 
lowering envelope stress. They also suggest that under extreme envelope stress, 
a tight homeostasis loop between RseA and σ(E) may partly be responsible for 
cell death, and this loop can be broken by mutations that either lower RseA 
activity or increase σ(E) levels.

Signal integration by DegS and RseB governs the &#963; E-mediated envelope

In Escherichia coli, the σ(E) transcription factor monitors and maintains outer 
membrane (OM) integrity by activating genes required for assembly of its two key 
components, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by 
transcribing small RNAs to down-regulate excess unassembled OMPs. σ(E) activity 
is governed by the rate of degradation of its membrane-spanning anti-σ factor, 
RseA. Importantly, the DegS protease can initiate RseA cleavage only when 
activated by binding to unassembled OMPs. The prevalent paradigm has been that 
the σ(E) response is controlled by the amount of activated DegS. Here we 
demonstrate that inactivation of a second negative regulator, the periplasmic 
protein RseB, is also required for σ(E) induction in vivo. Moreover, OMPs, 
previously known only to activate DegS, also generate a signal to antagonize 
RseB inhibition. This signal may be lipid related, as RseB is structurally 
similar to proteins that bind lipids. We propose that the use of an AND gate 
enables σ(E) to sense and integrate multivariate signals from the envelope.

OBJECTIVES: Polymyxins, including colistin, are the drugs of last resort to 
treat MDR bacterial infections in humans. In-depth understanding of the 
molecular basis and regulation of polymyxin resistance would provide new 
therapeutic opportunities to combat increasing polymyxin resistance. Here we 
aimed to identify novel targets that are crucial for polymyxin resistance using 
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), a unique colistin-resistant model strain.
METHODS: BL21(DE3) was subjected to random transposon mutagenesis for screening 
colistin-susceptible mutants. The insertion sites of desired mutants were 
mapped; the key genes of interest were also inactivated in different strains to 
examine functional conservation. Specific genes in the known PmrAB and PhoPQ 
regulatory network were inactivated to examine crosstalk among different 
pathways. Lipid A species and membrane phospholipids were analysed by normal 
phase LC/MS.
RESULTS: Among eight mutants with increased susceptibility to colistin, five 
mutants contained different mutations in three genes (rseP, degS and surA) that 
belong to the RpoE stress response pathway. Inactivation of rpoE, pmrB, eptA or 
pmrD led to significantly increased susceptibility to colistin; however, 
inactivation of phoQ or eptB did not change colistin MIC. RpoE mutation in 
different E. coli and Salmonella resistant strains all led to significant 
reduction in colistin MIC (16-32-fold). Inactivation of rpoE did not change the 
lipid A profile but significantly altered the phospholipid profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of the important members of the RpoE regulon in 
polymyxin-resistant strains led to a drastic reduction in polymyxin MIC and an 
increase of lysophospholipids with no change in lipid A modifications.

The alternative sigma (σ) factor E, RpoE or HrpL, has been reported to be 
involved in stress- and pathogenicity-related transcription initiation in 
Escherichia coli and many other Gram-negative bacteria, including Erwinia spp. 
and Pseudomonas spp. A previous study identified the hrpL/rpoE transcript as one 
of the significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during early E. 
mallotivora infection in papaya and those data serve as the basis of the current 
project. Here, the full coding DNA sequence (CDS) of hrpL from E. mallotivora 
(EmhrpL) was determined to be 549 bp long, and it encoded a 21.3 kDa HrpL 
protein that possessed two highly conserved sigma-70 (σ70) motifs-σR2 and σR4. 
Nucleotide sequence alignment revealed the hrpL from E. mallotivora shared high 
sequence similarity to rpoE/hrpL from E. tracheiphila (83%), E. pyrifoliae 
(81%), and E. tasmaniensis (80%). Phylogenetics analysis indicated hrpL from E. 
mallotivora to be monophyletic with rpoEs/hrpLs from Pantoea vagans, E. 
herbicola, and E. tracheiphila. Structural analysis postulated that the E. 
mallotivora's alternative σ factor was non-transmembranic and was an 
extracytoplasmic function (ECF) protein-characteristics shared by other σ 
factors in different bacterial species. Notably, the protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) study through molecular docking suggested the σ factor could be possibly 
inhibited by an anti-σ. Finally, a knockout of hrpL in E. mallotivora (ΔEmhrpL) 
resulted in avirulence in four-month-old papaya plants. These findings have 
revealed that the hrpL is a necessary element in E. mallotivora pathogenicity 
and also predicted that the gene can be inhibited by an anti-σ.

DegS and RseP homologous proteases are involved in singlet oxygen dependent

Singlet oxygen ((1)O2) is the main agent of photooxidative stress and is 
generated by photosensitizers as (bacterio)chlorophylls. It leads to the damage 
of cellular macromolecules and therefore photosynthetic organisms have to mount 
an adaptive response to (1)O2 formation. A major player of the photooxidative 
stress response in Rhodobacter sphaeroides is the alternative sigma factor RpoE, 
which is inactivated under non-stress conditions by its cognate anti-sigma 
factor ChrR. By using random mutagenesis we identified RSP_1090 to be required 
for full activation of the RpoE response under (1)O2 stress, but not under 
organic peroxide stress. In this study we show that both RSP_1090 and RSP_1091 
are required for full resistance towards (1)O2. Moreover, we revealed that the 
DegS and RseP homologs RSP_3242 and RSP_2710 contribute to (1)O2 resistance and 
promote ChrR proteolysis. The RpoE signaling pathway in R. sphaeroides is 
therefore highly similar to that of Escherichia coli, although very different 
anti-sigma factors control RpoE activity. Based on the acquired results, the 
current model for RpoE activation in response to (1)O2 exposure in R. 
sphaeroides was extended.

levels greater than that seen in the rseA mutant background but did not reduce 
OMP levels. A σ(E)-dependent RybB::LacZ construct showed only a weak activation 
of the σ(E) pathway by rpoE3. Despite this, rpoE3 fully reversed the growth and 
envelope vesiculation phenotypes of ΔdegP. Interestingly, rpoE3 also brought 
down the modestly activated Cpx envelope stress pathway in the ΔdegP strain to 
the wild type level, showing the complementary nature of the σ(E) and Cpx 
pathways. Through employing a labile mutant periplasmic protein, AcrA(L222Q), it 
was determined that the rpoE3 mutation overcomes the ΔdegP phenotypes, in part, 
by activating a σ(E)-dependent proteolytic pathway. Our data suggest that a 
reduction in the OMP levels is not intrinsic to the σ(E)-mediated mechanism of 
lowering envelope stress. They also suggest that under extreme envelope stress, 
a tight homeostasis loop between RseA and σ(E) may partly be responsible for 
cell death, and this loop can be broken by mutations that either lower RseA 
activity or increase σ(E) levels.

We have been using mutagenesis to determine how biocontrol bacteria such as 
Enterobacter cloacae 501R3 deal with complex nutritional environments found in 
association with plants. E. cloacae C10, a mutant of 501R3 with a transposon 
insertion in degS, was diminished in growth on synthetic cucumber root exudate 
(SRE), colonization of cucumber seed and roots, and control of damping-off of 
cucumber caused by Pythium ultimum. DegS, a periplasmic serine protease in the 
closely related bacterium Escherichia coli K12, is required for the 
RpoE-mediated stress response. C10 containing wild-type degS from 501R3 or from 
E. coli K12 on pBeloBAC11 was significantly increased in growth on SRE, 
colonization of cucumber roots, and control of P. ultimum relative to C10 
containing pBeloBAC11 alone. C10 and 501R3 were similar in sensitivity to acidic 
conditions, plant-derived phenolic compounds, oxidative stress caused by 
hydrogen peroxide, dessication, and high osmoticum; stress conditions 
potentially associated with plants. This study demonstrates a role for degS in 
the spermosphere and rhizosphere during colonization and disease control by 
Enterobacter cloacae. This study implicates, for the first time, the involvement 
of DegS and, by extension, the RpoE-mediated stress response, in reducing stress 
on E. cloacae resulting from the complex nutritional environments in the 
spermosphere and rhizosphere.

Loss of Hfq activates the sigmaE-dependent envelope stress response in 
Salmonella enterica.

Ubiquitous RNA-binding protein Hfq mediates the regulatory activity of many 
small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria. To identify potential targets for Hfq-mediated 
regulation in Salmonella, we searched for lacZ translational fusions whose 
activity varied in the presence or absence of Hfq. Fusions downregulated by Hfq 
were more common than fusions showing the opposite response. Surprisingly, in a 
subset of isolates from the major class, the higher activity in the absence of 
Hfq was due to transcriptional activation by the alternative sigma factor RpoE 
(sigmaE). Activation of the sigmaE regulon normally results from envelope stress 
conditions that elicit proteolytic cleavage of the anti-sigmaE factor RseA. 
Using an epitope tagged variant of RseA, we found that RseA is cleaved at an 
increased rate in a strain lacking Hfq. This cleavage was dependent on the DegS 
protease and could be completely prevented upon expressing the hfq gene from an 
inducible promoter. Thus, loss of Hfq function appears to affect envelope 
biogenesis in a way that mimics a stress condition and thereby induces the 
sigmaE response constitutively. In a RseA mutant, activation of the sigmaE 
response causes Hfq-dependent downregulation of outer membrane protein (OMP) 
genes including lamB, ompA, ompC and ompF. For ompA, downregulation results in 
part from sigmaE-dependent accumulation of MicA (SraD), a small RNA recently 
shown to downregulate ompA transcript levels in stationary phase. We show that 
the micA gene is under sigmaE control, and that DegS-mediated sigmaE release is 
required for the accumulation of MicA RNA upon entry into stationary phase. A 
similar mechanism involving additional, still unidentified, sRNAs, might 
underlie the growth phase-dependent regulation of other OMP mRNAs.

Effect of inactivation of degS on Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in

The alternative sigma factor (RpoE sigma(E)) enables Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium to adapt to stressful conditions, such as oxidative stress, nutrient 
deprivation, and growth in mammalian tissues. Infection of mice by Salmonella 
serovar Typhimurium also requires sigma(E). In Escherichia coli, activation of 
the sigma(E) pathway is dependent on proteolysis of the anti-sigma factor RseA 
and is initiated by DegS. DegS is also important in order for E. coli to cause 
extraintestinal infection in mice. We constructed a degS mutant of the serovar 
Typhimurium strain SL1344 and compared its behavior in vitro and in vivo with 
those of its wild-type (WT) parent and an isogenic rpoE mutant. Unlike E. coli 
degS strains, the Salmonella serovar Typhimurium degS strain grew as well as the 
WT strain at 42 degrees C. The degS mutant survived very poorly in murine 
macrophages in vitro and was highly attenuated compared with the WT strain for 
both the oral and parenteral routes of infection in mice. However, the degS 
mutant was not as attenuated as the serovar Typhimurium rpoE mutant: 100- to 
1,000-fold more degS bacteria than rpoE bacteria were present in the livers and 
spleens of mice 24 h after intraperitoneal challenge. In most assays, the rpoE 
mutant was more severely affected than the degS mutant and a sigma(E)-dependent 
reporter gene was more active in the degS mutant than the rpoE strain. These 
findings indicate that degS is important for activation of the sigma(E) pathway 
in serovar Typhimurium but that alternative pathways for sigma(E) activation 
probably exist.

YaeL (EcfE) activates the sigma(E) pathway of stress response through a site-2 
cleavage of anti-sigma(E), RseA.

Kanehara K(1), Ito K, Akiyama Y.

Escherichia coli YaeL (EcfE) is a homolog of human site-2 protease (S2P), a 
membrane-bound zinc metalloprotease involved in regulated intramembrane 
proteolysis. We have shown previously that YaeL, having essential 
metalloprotease active site motifs in the cytoplasmic domain, is indispensable 
for viability. Here, we obtained rpoE, encoding an extracytoplasmic stress 
response sigma factor (sigma(E)), as a multicopy suppressor against the yaeL 
disruption. Whereas sigma(E) is thought to be activated by regulated cleavage of 
RseA on the periplasmic side by the DegS protease, we found that a degradation 
intermediate of RseA consisting of the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains 
accumulated in the YaeL-depleted cells. This intermediate was degraded on 
expression of YaeL but not of its metalloprotease motif mutants. Cells depleted 
of YaeL were incapable of activating a sigma(E)-dependent promoter in response 
to an envelope stress. It is suggested that sigma(E) activation involves two 
successive proteolytic cleavages: first, at a periplasmic site by DegS; second, 
at a cytoplasmic or intramembrane site by YaeL. Thus, YaeL is positively 
required for the sigma(E) extracytoplasmic stress response.

Stability by multimer resolution of pJHCMW1 is due to the Tn1331 resolvase and 
not to the Escherichia coli Xer system.

The plasmid pJHCMW1 encodes resistance to several aminoglycosides and 
beta-lactams and consists of a copy of the transposon Tn1331, a region including 
the replication functions, and a sequence with homology to ColE1 cer, designated 
mwr. In this work, the role of this cer-like site in ensuring the stable 
inheritance of pJHCMW1 by multimer resolution was studied. The Escherichia coli 
Xer site-specific recombination system acts at sites such as ColE1 cer to 
resolve plasmid multimers formed by homologous recombination, thereby 
maintaining plasmids in a monomeric state and helping to ensure stable plasmid 
inheritance. Despite its high similarity to ColE1 cer, the pJHCMW1 mwr was a 
poor substrate for Xer recombination in E. coli and did not contribute 
significantly to plasmid stability. Instead, the Tn1331 co-integrate resolution 
system was highly active at resolving pJHCMW1 multimers and ensured the stable 
inheritance of pJHCMW1. Although Xer recombination at pJHCMW1 mwr was 
inefficient in E. coli, the recombination that did occur was dependent on ArgR, 
PepA, XerC and XerD. A supercoiled circular DNA molecule containing two pJHCMW1 
mwr sites in direct repeat yielded Holliday-junction-containing product when 
incubated with ArgR, PepA, XerC and XerD in vitro, confirming that pJHCMW1 mwr 
is a functional recombination site. However, unlike cer, some 
Holliday-junction-containing product could be detected for mwr in the absence of 
ArgR, although addition of this protein resulted in formation of more Holliday 
junctions. Binding experiments demonstrated that XerD bound to pJHCMW1 mwr core 
with a high affinity, but that XerC bound to this site very poorly, even in the 
presence of XerD.

Role of global regulators and nucleotide metabolism in antibiotic tolerance in 
Escherichia coli.

University, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Bacterial populations produce a small number of persister cells that exhibit 
multidrug tolerance. Persister cells are largely responsible for the antibiotic 
recalcitrance of biofilm infections. The mechanism of persister cell formation 
largely remains unknown due to the challenges in identifying persister genes. We 
screened an ordered comprehensive library of 3,985 Escherichia coli knockout 
strains to identify mutants with altered antibiotic tolerance. Stationary-state 
cultures in 96-well plates were exposed to ofloxacin at a concentration which 
allows only tolerant persister cells to survive. The persister cell level of 
each culture was determined. A total of 150 mutants with decreased persistence 
were identified in the initial screen, and subsequent validation confirmed that 
neither the growth rate nor the ofloxacin MIC was affected for 10 of them. The 
genes affected in these strains were dnaJ and dnaK (chaperones), apaH 
(diadenosine tetraphosphatase), surA (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase), fis 
and hns (global regulators), hnr (response regulator of RpoS), dksA 
(transcriptional regulator of rRNA transcription), ygfA 
(5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase), and yigB (flavin mononucleotide [FMN] 
phosphatase). The prominent presence of global regulators among these strains 
pointed to the likely redundancy of persister cell formation mechanisms: the 
elimination of a regulator controlling several redundant persister genes would 
be expected to produce a phenotype. This observation is consistent with previous 
findings for a possible role of redundant genes such as toxin/antitoxin modules 
in persister cell formation. ygfA and yigB were of special interest. The 
mammalian homolog of YgfA (methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase) catalyzes the 
conversion of 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (THF) into the rapidly degraded 
5,10-methenyl-THF, depleting the folate pool. The YigB protein is a phosphatase 
of FMN which would deplete the pool of this cofactor. Stochastic overexpression 
of these genes could lead to dormancy and, hence, tolerance by depleting the 
folate and FMN pools, respectively. Consistent with this scenario, the 
overexpression of both genes produced increased tolerance to ofloxacin.

Bacterial growth state distinguished by single-cell protein profiling: does 
chlorination kill coliforms in municipal effluent?

Municipal effluent is the largest reservoir of human enteric bacteria. Its 
public health significance, however, depends upon the physiological status of 
the wastewater bacterial community. A novel immunofluorescence assay was 
developed and used to examine the bacterial growth state during wastewater 
disinfection. Quantitative levels of three highly conserved cytosolic proteins 
(DnaK, Dps, and Fis) were determined by using enterobacterium-specific antibody 
fluorochrome-coupled probes. Enterobacterial Fis homologs were abundant in 
growing cells and nearly undetectable in stationary-phase cells. In contrast, 
enterobacterial Dps homologs were abundant in stationary-phase cells but 
virtually undetectable in growing cells. The range of variation in the abundance 
of both proteins was at least 100-fold as determined by Western blotting and 
immunofluorescence analysis. Enterobacterial DnaK homologs were nearly invariant 
with growth state, enabling their use as permeabilization controls. The cellular 
growth states of individual enterobacteria in wastewater samples were determined 
by measurement of Fis, Dps, and DnaK abundance (protein profiling). Intermediate 
levels of Fis and Dps were evident and occurred in response to physiological 
transitions. The results indicate that chlorination failed to kill coliforms but 
rather elicited nutrient starvation and a reversible nonculturable state. These 
studies suggest that the current standard procedures for wastewater analysis 
which rely on detection of culturable cells likely underestimate fecal coliform 
content.

It has long been noted that batch cultures inoculated with resting bacteria 
exhibit a progression of growth phases traditionally labeled lag, exponential, 
pre-stationary and stationary. However, a detailed molecular description of the 
mechanisms controlling the transitions between these phases is lacking. A core 
circuit, formed by a subset of regulatory interactions involving five global 
transcription factors (FIS, HNS, IHF, RpoS and GadX), has been identified by 
correlating information from the well- established transcriptional regulatory 
network of Escherichia coli and genome-wide expression data from cultures in 
these different growth phases. We propose a functional role for this circuit in 
controlling progression through these phases. Two alternative hypotheses for 
controlling the transition between the growth phases are first, a continuous 
graded adjustment to changing environmental conditions, and second, a 
discontinuous hysteretic switch at critical thresholds between growth phases. We 
formulate a simple mathematical model of the core circuit, consisting of 
differential equations based on the power-law formalism, and show by 
mathematical and computer-assisted analysis that there are critical conditions 
among the parameters of the model that can lead to hysteretic switch behavior, 
which--if validated experimentally--would suggest that the transitions between 
different growth phases might be analogous to cellular differentiation. Based on 
these provocative results, we propose experiments to test the alternative 
hypotheses.

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) causes diarrhea in diverse populations 
worldwide. The AraC-like regulator AggR is a key virulence regulator in EAEC. 
AggR-regulated genes include those encoding the Aggregative Adherence Fimbria, 
the dispersin protein, and a type VI secretion system. This study characterizes 
the regulation of the aggR promoter (P(aggR)). Using primer extension analysis, 
the transcriptional start site of the aggR promoter was located 40 nucleotides 
upstream of the translational start. P(aggR) was found to be autoregulated and 
DNA footprinting revealed the presence of two AggR-binding sites: one upstream 
of the transcriptional start site and one downstream. Additionally, P(aggR) was 
found to be positively regulated by the DNA-binding protein FIS and negatively 
regulated by the global regulator H-NS. To further understand this complex 
regulation scheme, a bacterial luciferase reporter system was used with a mouse 
model of EAEC colonization. This allowed for the in vivo measurement of P(aggR), 
P(fis), and P(hns) activity. EAEC present in the mouse intestine possessed 
relatively high levels of P(fis) and P(aggR) activity and a low level of P(hns) 
when compared with in vitro experiments. The data provide significant insights 
into the regulation cascade leading to aggR expression in the mammalian 
intestine during EAEC infection.

Effects of Global and Specific DNA-Binding Proteins on Transcriptional

Using reporter gene (lacZ) transcriptional fusions, we examined the 
transcriptional dependencies of the bgl promoter (Pbgl) and the entire operon 
regulatory region (Pbgl-bglG) on eight transcription factors as well as the 
inducer, salicin, and an IS5 insertion upstream of Pbgl. Crp-cAMP is the primary 
activator of both Pbgl and the bgl operon, while H-NS is a strong dominant 
operon repressor but only a weak repressor of Pbgl. H-NS may exert its 
repressive effect by looping the DNA at two binding sites. StpA is a relatively 
weak repressor in the absence of H-NS, while Fis also has a weak repressive 
effect. Salicin has no effect on Pbgl activity but causes a 30-fold induction of 
bgl operon expression. Induction depends on the activity of the BglF 
transporter/kinase. IS5 insertion has only a moderate effect on Pbgl but causes 
a much greater activation of the bgl operon expression by preventing the full 
repressive effects of H-NS and StpA. While several other transcription factors 
(BglJ, RcsB, and LeuO) have been reported to influence bgl operon transcription 
when overexpressed, they had little or no effect when present at wild type 
levels. These results indicate the important transcriptional regulatory 
mechanisms operative on the bgl operon in E. coli.

Living organisms have sophisticated but well-organized regulation system. It is 
important to understand the metabolic regulation mechanisms in relation to 
growth environment for the efficient design of cell factories for biofuels and 
biochemicals production. Here, an overview is given for carbon catabolite 
regulation, nitrogen regulation, ion, sulfur, and phosphate regulations, 
stringent response under nutrient starvation as well as oxidative stress 
regulation, redox state regulation, acid-shock, heat- and cold-shock 
regulations, solvent stress regulation, osmoregulation, and biofilm formation, 
and quorum sensing focusing on Escherichia coli metabolism and others. The 
coordinated regulation mechanisms are of particular interest in getting insight 
into the principle which governs the cell metabolism. The metabolism is 
controlled by both enzyme-level regulation and transcriptional regulation via 
transcription factors such as cAMP-Crp, Cra, Csr, Fis, P(II)(GlnB), NtrBC, CysB, 
PhoR/B, SoxR/S, Fur, MarR, ArcA/B, Fnr, NarX/L, RpoS, and (p)ppGpp for stringent 
response, where the timescales for enzyme-level and gene-level regulations are 
different. Moreover, multiple regulations are coordinated by the intracellular 
metabolites, where fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 
and acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) play important roles for enzyme-level regulation as well 
as transcriptional control, while α-ketoacids such as α-ketoglutaric acid (αKG), 
pyruvate (PYR), and oxaloacetate (OAA) play important roles for the coordinated 
regulation between carbon source uptake rate and other nutrient uptake rate such 
as nitrogen or sulfur uptake rate by modulation of cAMP via Cya.

Regulation Systems of Bacteria such as Escherichia coli in Response to Nutrient 
Limitation and Environmental Stresses.

An overview was made to understand the regulation system of a bacterial cell 
such as Escherichia coli in response to nutrient limitation such as carbon, 
nitrogen, phosphate, sulfur, ion sources, and environmental stresses such as 
oxidative stress, acid shock, heat shock, and solvent stresses. It is quite 
important to understand how the cell detects environmental signals, integrate 
such information, and how the cell system is regulated. As for catabolite 
regulation, F1,6B P (FDP), PEP, and PYR play important roles in enzyme level 
regulation together with transcriptional regulation by such transcription 
factors as Cra, Fis, CsrA, and cAMP-Crp. αKG plays an important role in the 
coordinated control between carbon (C)- and nitrogen (N)-limitations, where αKG 
inhibits enzyme I (EI) of phosphotransferase system (PTS), thus regulating the 
glucose uptake rate in accordance with N level. As such, multiple regulation 
systems are co-ordinated for the cell synthesis and energy generation against 
nutrient limitations and environmental stresses. As for oxidative stress, the 
TCA cycle both generates and scavenges the reactive oxygen species (ROSs), where 
NADPH produced at ICDH and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathways play an 
important role in coping with oxidative stress. Solvent resistant mechanism was 
also considered for the stresses caused by biofuels and biochemicals production 
in the cell.

of translation in Escherichia coli cultured with glucose and glutamate.

Proteins whose synthesis is enhanced by polyamines at the level of translation 
were identified in a polyamine-requiring mutant cultured in the presence of 0.1% 
glucose and 0.02% glutamate instead of 0.4% glucose as an energy source. Under 
these conditions, enhancement of cell growth by polyamines was almost the same 
as that in the presence of 0.4% glucose. It was found that synthesis of RpoN, 
Cra, and H-NS was enhanced by polyamines at the level of translation at the 
early logarithmic phase of growth (A(540) of 0.15). The effects of polyamines on 
synthesis of RpoN, H-NS, and Cra were due to the existence of unusual 
Shine-Dalgarno sequences (RpoN and H-NS) and an inefficient GUG initiation codon 
(Cra) in their mRNAs. Thus, rpoN, cra, and hns genes were identified as new 
members of the polyamine modulon. Because most of the polyamine modulon genes 
thus far identified encode transcription factors (RpoS [sigma(38)], Cya, FecI 
[sigma(18)], Fis, RpoN [sigma(54)], Cra, and H-NS), DNA microarray analysis of 
mRNA expressed in cells was performed. At the early logarithmic phase of growth, 
a total of 97 species of mRNAs that were up-regulated by polyamines more than 
twofold were under the control of seven polyamine modulon genes mentioned above.

Regulation of adhE (encoding ethanol oxidoreductase) by the Fis protein in 
Escherichia coli.

The adhE gene of Escherichia coli encodes a multifunctional ethanol 
oxidoreductase whose expression is 10-fold higher under anaerobic than aerobic 
conditions. Transcription of the gene is under the negative control of the Cra 
(catabolite repressor-activator) protein, whereas translation of the adhE mRNA 
requires processing by RNase III. In this report, we show that the expression of 
adhE also depends on the Fis (factor for inversion stimulation) protein. A 
strain bearing a fis::kan null allele failed to grow anaerobically on glucose 
solely because of inadequate adhE transcription. However, fis expression itself 
is not under redox control. Sequence inspection of the adhE promoter revealed 
three potential Fis binding sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, 
using purified Fis protein and adhE promoter DNA, showed three different 
complexes.

TusA Is a Versatile Protein That Links Translation Efficiency to Cell Division 
in Escherichia coli.

To enable accurate and efficient translation, sulfur modifications are 
introduced posttranscriptionally into nucleosides in tRNAs. The biosynthesis of 
tRNA sulfur modifications involves unique sulfur trafficking systems for the 
incorporation of sulfur atoms in different nucleosides of tRNA. One of the 
proteins that is involved in inserting the sulfur for 
5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm5s2U34) modifications in tRNAs is the TusA 
protein. TusA, however, is a versatile protein that is also involved in numerous 
other cellular pathways. Despite its role as a sulfur transfer protein for the 
2-thiouridine formation in tRNA, a fundamental role of TusA in the general 
physiology of Escherichia coli has also been discovered. Poor viability, a 
defect in cell division, and a filamentous cell morphology have been described 
previously for tusA-deficient cells. In this report, we aimed to dissect the 
role of TusA for cell viability. We were able to show that the lack of the 
thiolation status of wobble uridine (U34) nucleotides present on Lys, Gln, or 
Glu in tRNAs has a major consequence on the translation efficiency of proteins; 
among the affected targets are the proteins RpoS and Fis. Both proteins are 
major regulatory factors, and the deregulation of their abundance consequently 
has a major effect on the cellular regulatory network, with one consequence 
being a defect in cell division by regulating the FtsZ ring formation.IMPORTANCE 
More than 100 different modifications are found in RNAs. One of these 
modifications is the mnm5s2U modification at the wobble position 34 of tRNAs for 
Lys, Gln, and Glu. The functional significance of U34 modifications is 
substantial since it restricts the conformational flexibility of the anticodon, 
thus providing translational fidelity. We show that in an Escherichia coli TusA 
mutant strain, involved in sulfur transfer for the mnm5s2U34 thio modifications, 
the translation efficiency of RpoS and Fis, two major cellular regulatory 
proteins, is altered. Therefore, in addition to the transcriptional regulation 
and the factors that influence protein stability, tRNA modifications that ensure 
the translational efficiency provide an additional crucial regulatory factor for 
protein synthesis.

Transcription initiation by bacterial σ(54)-polymerase requires the action of a 
transcriptional activator protein. Activators bind sequence-specifically 
upstream of the transcription initiation site via a DNA-binding domain (DBD). 
The structurally characterized DBDs from activators all belong to the Fis 
(factor for inversion stimulation) family of helix-turn-helix DNA-binding 
proteins. We report here structures of the free and DNA-bound forms of the DBD 
of NtrC4 (4DBD) from Aquifex aeolicus, a member of the NtrC family of σ(54) 
activators. Two NtrC4-binding sites were identified upstream (-145 and -85bp) 
from the start of the lpxC gene, which is responsible for the first committed 
step in lipid A biosynthesis. This is the first experimental evidence for σ(54) 
regulation in lpxC expression. 4DBD was crystallized both without DNA and in 
complex with the -145-binding site. The structures, together with biochemical 
data, indicate that NtrC4 binds to DNA in a manner that is similar to that of 
its close homolog, Fis. The greater sequence specificity for the binding of 4DBD 
relative to Fis seems to arise from a larger number of base-specific contacts 
contributing to affinity than for Fis.

information theoretic concepts and sequence analysis.

BACKGROUND: Although Escherichia coli is one of the best studied model 
organisms, a comprehensive understanding of its gene regulation is not yet 
achieved. There exist many approaches to reconstruct regulatory interaction 
networks from gene expression experiments. Mutual information based approaches 
are most useful for large-scale network inference.
RESULTS: We used a three-step approach in which we combined gene regulatory 
network inference based on directed information (DTI) and sequence analysis. DTI 
values were calculated on a set of gene expression profiles from 19 time course 
experiments extracted from the Many Microbes Microarray Database. Focusing on 
influences between pairs of genes in which one partner encodes a transcription 
factor (TF) we derived a network which contains 878 TF - gene interactions of 
which 166 are known according to RegulonDB. Afterward, we selected a subset of 
109 interactions that could be confirmed by the presence of a phylogenetically 
conserved binding site of the respective regulator. By this second step, the 
fraction of known interactions increased from 19% to 60%. In the last step, we 
checked the 44 of the 109 interactions not yet included in RegulonDB for 
functional relationships between the regulator and the target and, thus, 
obtained ten TF - target gene interactions. Five of them concern the regulator 
LexA and have already been reported in the literature. The remaining five 
influences describe regulations by Fis (with two novel targets), PhdR, PhoP, and 
KdgR. For the validation of our approach, one of them, the regulation of lipoate 
synthase (LipA) by the pyruvate-sensing pyruvate dehydrogenate repressor (PdhR), 
was experimentally checked and confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS: We predicted a set of five novel TF - target gene interactions in 
E. coli. One of them, the regulation of lipA by the transcriptional regulator 
PdhR was validated experimentally. Furthermore, we developed DTInfer, a new 
R-package for the inference of gene-regulatory networks from microarrays using 
directed information.

BACKGROUND: Glucose is the preferred carbon and energy source for Escherichia 
coli. A complex regulatory network coordinates gene expression, transport and 
enzyme activities in response to the presence of this sugar. To determine the 
extent of the cellular response to glucose, we applied an approach combining 
global transcriptome and regulatory network analyses.
RESULTS: Transcriptome data from isogenic wild type and crp- strains grown in 
Luria-Bertani medium (LB) or LB + 4 g/L glucose (LB+G) were analyzed to identify 
differentially transcribed genes. We detected 180 and 200 genes displaying 
increased and reduced relative transcript levels in the presence of glucose, 
respectively. The observed expression pattern in LB was consistent with a 
gluconeogenic metabolic state including active transport and interconversion of 
small molecules and macromolecules, induction of protease-encoding genes and a 
partial heat shock response. In LB+G, catabolic repression was detected for 
transport and metabolic interconversion activities. We also detected an 
increased capacity for de novo synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids and 
proteins. Cluster analysis of a subset of genes revealed that CRP mediates 
catabolite repression for most of the genes displaying reduced transcript levels 
in LB+G, whereas Fis participates in the upregulation of genes under this 
condition. An analysis of the regulatory network, in terms of topological 
functional units, revealed 8 interconnected modules which again exposed the 
importance of Fis and CRP as directly responsible for the coordinated response 
of the cell. This effect was also seen with other not extensively connected 
transcription factors such as FruR and PdhR, which showed a consistent response 
considering media composition.
CONCLUSION: This work allowed the identification of eight interconnected 
regulatory network modules that includes CRP, Fis and other transcriptional 
factors that respond directly or indirectly to the presence of glucose. In most 
cases, each of these modules includes genes encoding physiologically related 
functions, thus indicating a connection between regulatory network topology and 
related cellular functions involved in nutrient sensing and metabolism.

Transcription and transcript processing in the sdhCDAB-sucABCD operon of 
Escherichia coli.

Biology and Biotechnology, University of SheffieldWestern Bank, Sheffield S10

The genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase (sdhCDAB), the specific components of 
the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (ODH, E1o and E2o; sucAB) and 
succinyl-CoA synthetase (sucCD) form a cluster containing two promoters at 16.3 
min in the chromosome of Escherichia coli: Psdh sdhCDAB-Psuc sucAB-sucCD. The 
gene encoding the lipoamide dehydrogenase component of both the 2-oxoglutarate 
and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (E3; lpdA) is the distal gene of another 
cluster containing two promoters located at 2.7 min: Ppdh pdhR-aceEF-Plpd lpdA. 
The responses of the suc and lpd promoters to different environmental conditions 
and to regulator defects were investigated with appropriate lacZ fusions, in 
order to understand how expression of the sucAB genes is co-regulated with other 
genes in the sdhCDAB-sucABCD cluster and with lpdA expression. Expression from 
the suc promoter was repressed by IHF and partially activated by sigma 38 but it 
was not regulated by ArcA, FNR, CRP, FruR or Fis, and not repressed by glucose 
or anaerobiosis, indicating that the well-established catabolite and anaerobic 
repression of ODH synthesis is imposed elsewhere. In contrast, the lpd promoter 
was repressed by both glucose (via a CRP-independent mechanism) and anaerobiosis 
(mediated by ArcA), and activated by Fis, but it was not regulated by FNR, FruR, 
IHF or sigma 38. These observations support the view that transcription of the 
sucABCD genes is primarily initiated and regulated at the upstream sdh promoter, 
and that the lpd promoter is independently co-regulated with Psdh (primarily by 
ArcA-mediated repression) rather than with Psuc. Direct evidence for 
co-transcription of the entire sdhCDAB-sucABCD region from Psdh was obtained by 
detecting a 10 kb transcript in rnc and rne mutants, but not in the parental 
strains. Three RNaseIII-specific processing sites, which contribute to the 
extreme instability of the readthrough transcript, were identified in the 
sdhCDAB-sucABCD intergenic region. Other sites of endonuclease processing were 
located by interpreting the patterns of transcript subfragments observed in 
Northern blotting.

The E. coli anti-sigma factor Rsd: studies on the specificity and regulation of 
its expression.

Hofmann N(1), Wurm R, Wagner R.

Author information:
(1)Institut für Physikalische Biologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, 
Düsseldorf, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Among the seven different sigma factors in E. coli σ(70) has the 
highest concentration and affinity for the core RNA polymerase. The E. coli 
protein Rsd is regarded as an anti-sigma factor, inhibiting σ(70)-dependent 
transcription at the onset of stationary growth. Although binding of Rsd to 
σ(70) has been shown and numerous structural studies on Rsd have been performed 
the detailed mechanism of action is still unknown.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have performed studies to unravel the 
function and regulation of Rsd expression in vitro and in vivo. Cross-linking 
and affinity binding revealed that Rsd is able to interact with σ(70), with the 
core enzyme of RNA polymerase and is able to form dimers in solution. 
Unexpectedly, we find that Rsd does also interact with σ(38), the stationary 
phase-specific sigma factor. This interaction was further corroborated by gel 
retardation and footprinting studies with different promoter fragments and 
σ(38)- or σ(70)-containing RNA polymerase in presence of Rsd. Under competitive 
in vitro transcription conditions, in presence of both sigma factors, a 
selective inhibition of σ(70)-dependent transcription was prevailing, however. 
Analysis of rsd expression revealed that the nucleoid-associated proteins H-NS 
and FIS, StpA and LRP bind to the regulatory region of the rsd promoters. 
Furthermore, the major promoter P2 was shown to be down-regulated in vivo by 
RpoS, the stationary phase-specific sigma factor and the transcription factor 
DksA, while induction of the stringent control enhanced rsd promoter activity. 
Most notably, the dam-dependent methylation of a cluster of GATC sites turned 
out to be important for efficient rsd transcription.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results contribute to a better understanding of 
the intricate mechanism of Rsd-mediated sigma factor specificity changes during 
stationary phase.

Role of global regulators and nucleotide metabolism in antibiotic tolerance in 
Escherichia coli.

University, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Bacterial populations produce a small number of persister cells that exhibit 
multidrug tolerance. Persister cells are largely responsible for the antibiotic 
recalcitrance of biofilm infections. The mechanism of persister cell formation 
largely remains unknown due to the challenges in identifying persister genes. We 
screened an ordered comprehensive library of 3,985 Escherichia coli knockout 
strains to identify mutants with altered antibiotic tolerance. Stationary-state 
cultures in 96-well plates were exposed to ofloxacin at a concentration which 
allows only tolerant persister cells to survive. The persister cell level of 
each culture was determined. A total of 150 mutants with decreased persistence 
were identified in the initial screen, and subsequent validation confirmed that 
neither the growth rate nor the ofloxacin MIC was affected for 10 of them. The 
genes affected in these strains were dnaJ and dnaK (chaperones), apaH 
(diadenosine tetraphosphatase), surA (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase), fis 
and hns (global regulators), hnr (response regulator of RpoS), dksA 
(transcriptional regulator of rRNA transcription), ygfA 
(5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase), and yigB (flavin mononucleotide [FMN] 
phosphatase). The prominent presence of global regulators among these strains 
pointed to the likely redundancy of persister cell formation mechanisms: the 
elimination of a regulator controlling several redundant persister genes would 
be expected to produce a phenotype. This observation is consistent with previous 
findings for a possible role of redundant genes such as toxin/antitoxin modules 
in persister cell formation. ygfA and yigB were of special interest. The 
mammalian homolog of YgfA (methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase) catalyzes the 
conversion of 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (THF) into the rapidly degraded 
5,10-methenyl-THF, depleting the folate pool. The YigB protein is a phosphatase 
of FMN which would deplete the pool of this cofactor. Stochastic overexpression 
of these genes could lead to dormancy and, hence, tolerance by depleting the 
folate and FMN pools, respectively. Consistent with this scenario, the 
overexpression of both genes produced increased tolerance to ofloxacin.

DksA is required for growth phase-dependent regulation, growth rate-dependent 
control, and stringent control of fis expression in Escherichia coli.

Avenue, Albany, NY 12222, USA.

DksA is a critical transcription factor in Escherichia coli that binds to RNA 
polymerase and potentiates control of rRNA promoters and certain amino acid 
promoters. Given the kinetic similarities between rRNA promoters and the fis 
promoter (Pfis), we investigated the possibility that DksA might also control 
transcription from Pfis. We show that the absence of dksA extends transcription 
from Pfis well into the late logarithmic and stationary growth phases, 
demonstrating the importance of DksA for growth phase-dependent regulation of 
fis. We also show that transcription from Pfis increases with steady-state 
growth rate and that dksA is absolutely required for this regulation. In 
addition, both DksA and ppGpp are required for inhibition of Pfis promoter 
activity following amino acid starvation, and these factors act directly and 
synergistically to negatively control Pfis transcription in vitro. DksA 
decreases the half-life of the intrinsically short-lived fis promoter-RNA 
polymerase complex and increases its sensitivity to the concentration of CTP, 
the predominant initiating nucleotide triphosphate for this promoter. This work 
extends our understanding of the multiple factors controlling fis expression and 
demonstrates the generality of the DksA requirement for regulation of 
kinetically similar promoters.

Chromosomes are divided into topologically independent regions, called domains, 
by the action of uncharacterized barriers. With the goal of identifying domain 
barrier components, we designed a genetic selection for mutants with reduced 
negative supercoiling of the Escherichia coli chromosome. We employed a strain 
that contained two chromosomally located reporter genes under the control of a 
supercoiling-sensitive promoter and used transposon mutagenesis to generate a 
wide range of mutants. We subjected the selected mutants to a series of 
secondary screens and identified five proteins as modulators of chromosomal 
supercoiling in vivo. Three of these proteins: H-NS, Fis and DksA, have clear 
ties to chromosome biology. The other two proteins, phosphoglucomutase (Pgm) and 
transketolase (TktA), are enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and have 
not previously been shown to affect DNA. Deletion of any of the identified genes 
specifically affected chromosome topology, without affecting plasmid 
supercoiling. We suggest that at least H-NS, Fis and perhaps TktA assist 
directly in the supercoiling of domains by forming topological barriers on the 
E. coli chromosome.

interacting with RNA polymerase on ribosomal promoters.

In Escherichia coli transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is regulated by the 
H-NS and Fis proteins, as well as by the small signal molecule ppGpp and the 
initiating nucleotides. During amino acid starvation, the concentration of ppGpp 
increases, and binding of this alarmone to RNA polymerase (RNAP) leads to 
inhibition of rRNA transcription, a regulatory event called stringent response. 
Here we show that in Pseudomonas aeruginosa DksA, a protein with pleiotropic 
effects, is a negative regulator of rRNA transcription both during exponential 
growth and stringent conditions. A dksA mutant overexpresses rRNA, without being 
affected in the production of ppGpp. Cell-fractionation and chromosome 
immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that DksA is associated with DNA, in 
particular with promoters of ribosomal genes in vivo. The binding to rRNA 
promoters specifically increases during stringent response, and correlates with 
the binding of RNAP to these regions. Moreover DksA can be copurified with RNAP 
subunits in vivo. DNA band shift experiments show that DksA, in synergy with 
ppGpp, increases the binding of RNAP to ribosomal promoters. Therefore DksA 
might be a new regulator of rRNA transcription in P. aeruginosa.

Originally discovered in the bacteriophage Mu DNA inversion system gin, Fis 
(Factor for Inversion Stimulation) regulates many genetic systems. To determine 
the base frequency conservation required for Fis to locate its binding sites, we 
collected a set of 60 experimentally defined wild-type Fis DNA binding 
sequences. The sequence logo for Fis binding sites showed the significance and 
likely kinds of base contacts, and these are consistent with available 
experimental data. Scanning with an information theory based weight matrix 
within fis, nrd, tgt/sec and gin revealed Fis sites not previously identified, 
but for which there are published footprinting and biochemical data. DNA 
mobility shift experiments showed that a site predicted to be 11 bases from the 
proximal Salmonella typhimurium hin site and a site predicted to be 7 bases from 
the proximal P1 cin site are bound by Fis in vitro. Two predicted sites 
separated by 11 bp found within the nrd promoter region, and one in the tgt/sec 
promoter, were also confirmed by gel shift analysis. A sequence in aldB 
previously reported to be a Fis site, for which information theory predicts no 
site, did not shift. These results demonstrate that information analysis is 
useful for predicting Fis DNA binding.

The tgt/sec operon in E. coli consists of five genes: queA, tgt, ORF12, secD, 
and secF. QueA and Tgt participate in the biosynthesis of the hypermodified 
t-RNA nucleoside Queuosine, whereas SecD and SecF are involved in protein 
secretion. Examination of the promoter region of the operon showed structural 
similarity to promoter regions of the rrn-operons. An upstream activation 
sequence (UAS) containing a potential binding site for the factor of inversion 
stimulation (FIS) was found. Gel retardation assays and DNaseI footprinting 
indicated, that FIS binds specifically and with high affinity to a site centred 
at position -58. Binding of FIS caused bending of the DNA, as deduced from 
circular permutation analysis. Various 5' deletion mutants of the promoter 
region were constructed and fused to a lacZ reporter gene to determine the 
influence of the UAS element on the promoter strength. An approximately two-fold 
activation of the promoter by the UAS element was observed.

Formation.

Persister cells are metabolically quiescent multi-drug tolerant fraction of a 
genetically sensitive bacterial population and are thought to be responsible for 
relapse of many persistent infections. Persisters can be formed naturally in the 
stationary phase culture, and also can be induced by bacteriostatic antibiotics. 
However, the molecular basis of bacteriostatic antibiotic induced persister 
formation is unknown. Here, we established a bacteriostatic antibiotic induced 
persister model and screened the Escherichia coli single gene deletion mutant 
library for mutants with defect in rifampin or tetracycline induced persistence 
to ofloxacin. Thirsty-seven and nine genes were found with defects in rifampin- 
and tetracycline-induced persister formation, respectively. Six mutants were 
found to overlap in both rifampin and tetracycline induced persister screens: 
recA, recC, ruvA, uvrD, fis, and acrB. Interestingly, four of these mutants 
(recA, recC, ruvA, and uvrD) mapped to DNA repair pathway, one mutant mapped to 
global transcriptional regulator (fis) and one to efflux (acrB). The stationary 
phase culture of the identified mutants and parent strain BW25113 were subjected 
to different antibiotics including ofloxacin, ampicillin, gentamicin, and stress 
conditions including starvation and acid pH 4.0. All the six mutants showed less 
tolerance to ofloxacin, but only some of them were more sensitive to other 
specific stress conditions. Complementation of five of the six common mutants 
restored the persister level to that of the parent strain in both stationary 
phase and static antibiotic-induced conditions. In addition to the DNA repair 
pathways shared by both rifampin and tetracycline induced persisters, genes 
involved in rifampin-induced persisters map also to transporters, LPS 
biosynthesis, flagella biosynthesis, metabolism (folate and energy), and 
translation, etc. These findings suggest that persisters generated by different 
ways may share common mechanisms of survival, and also shed new insight into the 
molecular basis of static antibiotic induced antagonism of cidal antibiotics.

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is an important pathotype that causes 
infection in humans and animals. EAEC isolates (n=86) recovered from diarrhoeal 
cases in human infants (37) and young animals (49) were characterized as 
'typical' and/or 'atypical' EAEC strains employing PCR for virulence associated 
genes (cvd432, aaiA, astA, pilS, irp2, ecp, pic, aggR, aafA, aggA, and agg3A). 
Besides, biofilm formation ability of human and animal EAEC isolates was 
assessed using microtiter plate assay. In addition, the transcriptional profile 
of biofilm associated genes (fis and ecp) was also evaluated and correlated with 
biofilm formation assay for few selected EAEC isolates of human and animal 
origins. Overall, a diverse virulence gene profile was observed for the EAEC 
isolates of human and animal origins as none of the EAEC isolates revealed the 
presence of all the genes that were targeted. Nine 'typical' EAEC isolates were 
identified (6 from humans and 3 from animals) while, the majority of the 
isolates were 'atypical' EAEC strains. Isolation and identification of three 
'typical' EAEC isolates from animals (canines) appears to be the first report 
globally. Further, based on the observations of the biofilm formation assay, the 
study suggested that human EAEC isolates in particular were comparatively more 
biofilm producers than that of the animal EAEC isolates. The fis gene was highly 
expressed in majority of 'typical' EAEC isolates and the ecp gene in 'atypical' 
EAEC isolates.

Poor-quality water in swimming pools associated with a substantial risk of 
otitis externa due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

There are many large and small public outdoor and indoor swimming pools in 
Tehran that hundreds of people use, especially on hot summer days. The 
bacteriological quality of the water of some of these pools was assayed over a 
period of about one year (2001-2002). To assess if these swimming pools were a 
health risk to users, eleven public swimming pools, in the east and northeast of 
the city, were examined, and the exposed people were monitored. Samples of 
swimming-pool waters were examined for colony counts, Escherichia coli and 
coliforms. In addition, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from nine (81.8%) of 
those pools. P. aeruginosa grew in seven (63.6%) of the swimming-pool water 
samples. In two (18.2%) other samples, in addition to P. aeruginosa, high rates 
of total bacterial count, total coliforms and faecal coliform counts were also 
found. At the same time, users of the swimming pools were asked to complete a 
questionnaire. Ear swabs were collected from 179 users with a history of ear 
problems during the previous two weeks. An adequate control group was chosen 
randomly from those who never used the investigated pools. P. aeruginosa was 
isolated from the ear swabs of 142 (79.3%) of the cases, as well as from 4% of 
the controls. Results were matched for age, sex, duration of time spent in the 
pools, place of occurrence and other useful information. Investigation of the 
contaminated swimming pools revealed that chlorination was often inadequate, 
especially when high numbers of people led to overuse of the pools. Although the 
results of this research showed that otitis externa was strongly associated with 
the swimming pools, due to P. aeruginosa, an extensive follow-up study is needed 
to determine the other possible health risks associated with public pools.

Growth phase-dependent variation in protein composition of the Escherichia coli 
nucleoid.

The genome DNA of Escherichia coli is associated with about 10 DNA-binding 
structural proteins, altogether forming the nucleoid. The nucleoid proteins play 
some functional roles, besides their structural roles, in the global regulation 
of such essential DNA functions as replication, recombination, and 
transcription. Using a quantitative Western blot method, we have performed for 
the first time a systematic determination of the intracellular concentrations of 
12 species of the nucleoid protein in E. coli W3110, including CbpA (curved 
DNA-binding protein A), CbpB (curved DNA-binding protein B, also known as Rob 
[right origin binding protein]), DnaA (DNA-binding protein A), Dps (DNA-binding 
protein from starved cells), Fis (factor for inversion stimulation), Hfq (host 
factor for phage Q(beta)), H-NS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein), HU 
(heat-unstable nucleoid protein), IciA (inhibitor of chromosome initiation A), 
IHF (integration host factor), Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein), and 
StpA (suppressor of td mutant phenotype A). Intracellular protein levels reach a 
maximum at the growing phase for nine proteins, CbpB (Rob), DnaA, Fis, Hfq, 
H-NS, HU, IciA, Lrp, and StpA, which may play regulatory roles in DNA 
replication and/or transcription of the growth-related genes. In descending 
order, the level of accumulation, calculated in monomers, in growing E. coli 
cells is Fis, Hfq, HU, StpA, H-NS, IHF*, CbpB (Rob), Dps*, Lrp, DnaA, IciA, and 
CbpA* (stars represent the stationary-phase proteins). The order of abundance, 
in descending order, in the early stationary phase is Dps*, IHF*, HU, Hfq, H-NS, 
StpA, CbpB (Rob), DnaA, Lrp, IciA, CbpA, and Fis, while that in the late 
stationary phase is Dps*, IHF*, Hfq, HU, CbpA*, StpA, H-NS, CbpB (Rob), DnaA, 
Lrp, IciA, and Fis. Thus, the major protein components of the nucleoid change 
from Fis and HU in the growing phase to Dps in the stationary phase. The curved 
DNA-binding protein, CbpA, appears only in the late stationary phase. These 
changes in the composition of nucleoid-associated proteins in the stationary 
phase are accompanied by compaction of the genome DNA and silencing of the 
genome functions.

The trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) regulates the steady-state levels 
of transcripts of the Bacillus subtilis folate operon.

Roche Ltd, Grenzacherstrasse 124, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland.

The Bacillus subtilis folate operon contains nine genes. The first six genes are 
involved in the biosynthesis of folic acid and tryptophan and have been 
characterized previously. The 3'-region of the folate operon contains three 
additional ORFs: orf3, potentially encoding a DNA-binding protein of 68 amino 
acids, orf4, encoding a protein of 338 amino acids with homology to the Orf1 of 
the E. coli fis operon, and a putative lysyl-tRNA synthetase gene (LysS). Four 
transcripts were identified which encode the first two, eight or all nine 
proteins or only the last protein LysS. The folate operon contains two 
promoters, one upstream of the first gene and the second preceding LysS. 
Transcription of the entire folate operon starts 33 bp upstream of the ATG codon 
of pab, the first gene of the operon. The mtrB-encoded trp RNA-binding 
attenuation protein (TRAP) dramatically reduces the steady-state levels of the 
folate operon transcripts encoding the first eight and all nine proteins, but 
only has a relatively small effect on the steady-state level of the 2.1 kb 
transcript encoding the first two genes of the operon, pab and trpG. In 
addition, transcription of the folate operon is regulated in a 
growth-phase-dependent manner. Transcripts were present in very low levels after 
mid-exponential phase, but were dramatically increased directly after transfer 
of the cells to fresh medium. These results indicate that transcription of the 
folate operon is regulated by TRAP and also depends on the growth phase of the 
culture.

Escherichia coli Fis and DnaA proteins bind specifically to the nrd promoter 
region and affect expression of an nrd-lac fusion.

Augustin LB(1), Jacobson BA, Fuchs JA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Minnesota, St. Paul 55108.

The Escherichia coli nrd operon contains the genes encoding the two subunits of 
ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase. The regulation of the nrd operon has been 
observed to be very complex. The specific binding of two proteins to the nrd 
regulatory region and expression of mutant nrd-lac fusions that do not bind 
these proteins are described. A partially purified protein from an E. coli cell 
extract was previously shown to bind to the promoter region and to regulate 
transcription of the nrd operon (C. K. Tuggle and J. A. Fuchs, J. Bacteriol. 
172:1711-1718, 1990). We have purified this protein to homogeneity by affinity 
chromatography and identified it as the E. coli factor for inversion stimulation 
(Fis). Cu-phenanthroline footprinting experiments showed that Fis binds to a 
site centered 156 bp upstream of the start of nrd transcription. Mutants with 
deletion and site-directed mutations that do not bind Fis at this site have two- 
to threefold-lower expression of an nrd-lac fusion. The previously reported 
negative regulatory nature of this site (C. K. Tuggle and J. A. Fuchs, J. 
Bacteriol. 172:1711-1718, 1990) was found to be due to a change in polarity in 
the vectors used to construct promoter fusions. Two nine-base sequences with 
homology to the DnaA consensus binding sequence are located immediately upstream 
of the nrd putative -35 RNA polymerase binding site. Binding of DnaA to these 
sequences on DNA fragments containing the nrd promoter region was confirmed by 
in vitro Cu-phenanthroline footprinting. Footprinting experiments on fragments 
with each as well as both of the mutated 9-mers suggests cooperativity between 
the two sites in binding DnaA. Assay of in vivo expression from wild-type and 
DnaA box-mutated nrd promoter fragments fused to lacZ on single-copy plasmids 
indicates a positive effect of DnaA binding on expression of nrd.

Transcriptional patterns of the mutL-miaA superoperon of Escherichia coli K-12 
suggest a model for posttranscriptional regulation.

Texas-Houston Medical School, 77030, USA.

The complex amiB-mutL-miaA-hfq-hflX-hflK-hflC superoperon of E coli contains 
important genes for several fundamental cellular processes, including cell-wall 
hydrolysis (amiB), DNA repair (mutL), tRNA modification (miaA) and proteolysis 
(hflX-hflK-hflC). We report here the transcriptional pattern and possible 
posttranscriptional regulation of mutL, miaA and hfq genes of this superoperon. 
RNase protection analysis of mRNA transcribed from the bacterial chromosome 
demonstrated that there is co-transcription of mutL and miaA. In addition, two 
internal promoters, PmiaA and P1hfq were identified and mapped to 201 and 837 
nucleotides upstream from the respective translation start sites. PmiaA contains 
poor matches to the -10 and -35 regions of the sigma-70 RNA polymerase consensus 
sequences, but it contains multiple potential Fis-binding sites and an upstream 
AT-rich region with poly(A) sequences. The basic arrangement of Fis-binding 
sites followed by an AT rich region is shared with promoters for rRNA operons 
and some of the tRNA and tRNA modification genes. As part of an initial study of 
mutL and miaA regulation, we measured transcript amounts in isogenic rne, rnc 
and rne rnc double mutants which are deficient in RNase E, RNase III or both. 
The amounts of steady state level mutL-miaA cotranscript, PmiaA transcript and 
P1hfq transcript increased eight-, nine- and three-fold respectively in an 
rne3071 mutant when compared to the rne+ parent. In contrast, amounts of the 
three transcripts were the same in an rnc105 mutant and its rnc+ parent. These 
results indicate that mutL, miaA, and hfq expression could be regulated by 
multiple mechanisms, including degree of cotranscription from upstream genes, 
modulation of internal promoter strength, and by RNase E activity. A model is 
presented for RNase E-mediated posttranscriptional regulation that may 
coordinate mutL expression with replication and miaA with tRNA amounts under 
different growth conditions, especially during nutrient upshifts.

Illegitimate recombination mediated by double-strand break and end-joining in 
Escherichia coli.

The frequency of illegitimate recombination has been measured by a lambda bio 
transducing phage assay during the induction of the E. coli lambda cI857 
lysogen. Illegitimate recombination falls into two classes, short 
homology-independent and short homology-dependent illegitimate recombination. 
The former involves sequences with virtually no homology, and is mediated by DNA 
topoisomerases and controlled by the DNA binding protein HU. The latter is 
induced by UV irradiation or other DNA damaging agents and requires short 
regions of homology, usually contain 4 to 13 base pairs, at sites involved in 
recombination. It has been shown that the RecJ exonuclease promotes short 
homology-dependent illegitimate recombination, but that the RecQ helicase 
suppresses it. In addition, we have shown that the overexpression of RecE and

The frequency of illegitimate recombination has been measured by a lambdabio 
transducing phage assay during the induction of the E. coli lambda c1857 
lysogen. Illegitimate recombination falls into two classes, short 
homology-independent and short homology-dependent illegitimate recombination. 
The former involves sequences with virtually no homology, and is mediated by DNA 
topoisomerases and controlled by the DNA binding protein HU. The latter is 
induced by UV irradiation or other DNA damaging agents and requires short 
regions of homology, usually contain 4 to 13 base pairs, at sites involved in 
recombination. It has been shown that the RecJ exonuclease promotes short 
homology-dependent illegitimate recombination, but that the RecQ helicase 
suppresses it. In addition, we have shown that the overexpression of RecE and 
RecT enhances the frequencies of spontaneous and UV-induced illegitimate 
recombination and that the RecJ, RecF, RecO, and RecR functions are required for 
this RecE-mediated illegitimate recombination. Moreover, we have also indicated 
that RecQ plays a role in the suppression of RecEmediated illegitimate 
recombination, with the participation of DnaB, Fis, Exol, and H-NS. Models have 
been proposed for these modes of recombination: the DNA gyrase subunit exchange 
model for short homology-independent illegitimate recombination and the 
"double-strand break and join" model for short homologydependent illegitimate 
recombination. Many features of these models remain to be tested in future

University, California 92182-4614, USA.

The region between the rpmH and dnaA genes contains five promoters that 
divergently express the ribosomal protein L34 and the proteins of the dnaA 
operon, including DnaA, the beta clamp of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and 
RecF. The DNA-binding protein Fis was shown by the band shift assay to bind near 
the rpmHp2 and dnaAp2 promoters and by DNase I footprinting to bind to a single 
site in the dnaAp2 promoter overlapping the -35 and spacer sequences. There were 
no observable differences in Fis affinity or the angle of bending induced by Fis 
between methylated and unmethylated DNA fragments containing the Fis binding 
site in the dnaAp2 promoter. Fis directly or indirectly represses the expression 
of DnaA protein and the beta clamp of DNA polymerase III. A fis null mutant 
containing a dnaA-lacZ in-frame fusion had twofold greater beta-galactosidase 
activity than a fis wild-type strain, and induced expression of Fis eliminated 
the increase in activity of the fusion protein. A two- to threefold increase in 
the levels of DnaA and beta clamp proteins was found in a fis null mutant by 
immunoblot gel analysis.

Negative feedback for DARS2-Fis complex by ATP-DnaA supports the cell 
cycle-coordinated regulation for chromosome replication.

In Escherichia coli, the replication initiator DnaA oscillates between an ATP- 
and an ADP-bound state in a cell cycle-dependent manner, supporting regulation 
for chromosome replication. ATP-DnaA cooperatively assembles on the replication 
origin using clusters of low-affinity DnaA-binding sites. After initiation, 
DnaA-bound ATP is hydrolyzed, producing initiation-inactive ADP-DnaA. For the 
next round of initiation, ADP-DnaA binds to the chromosomal locus DARS2, which 
promotes the release of ADP, yielding the apo-DnaA to regain the initiation 
activity through ATP binding. This DnaA reactivation by DARS2 depends on 
site-specific binding of IHF (integration host factor) and Fis proteins and IHF 
binding to DARS2 occurs specifically during pre-initiation. Here, we reveal that 
Fis binds to an essential region in DARS2 specifically during pre-initiation. 
Further analyses demonstrate that ATP-DnaA, but not ADP-DnaA, oligomerizes on a 
cluster of low-affinity DnaA-binding sites overlapping the Fis-binding region, 
which competitively inhibits Fis binding and hence the DARS2 activity. DiaA 
(DnaA initiator-associating protein) stimulating ATP-DnaA assembly enhances the 
dissociation of Fis. These observations lead to a negative feedback model where 
the activity of DARS2 is repressed around the time of initiation by the elevated 
ATP-DnaA level and is stimulated following initiation when the ATP-DnaA level is 
reduced.

Blocking, Bending, and Binding: Regulation of Initiation of Chromosome 
Replication During the Escherichia coli Cell Cycle by Transcriptional Modulators 
That Interact With Origin DNA.

Genome duplication is a critical event in the reproduction cycle of every cell. 
Because all daughter cells must inherit a complete genome, chromosome 
replication is tightly regulated, with multiple mechanisms focused on 
controlling when chromosome replication begins during the cell cycle. In 
bacteria, chromosome duplication starts when nucleoprotein complexes, termed 
orisomes, unwind replication origin (oriC) DNA and recruit proteins needed to 
build new replication forks. Functional orisomes comprise the conserved 
initiator protein, DnaA, bound to a set of high and low affinity recognition 
sites in oriC. Orisomes must be assembled each cell cycle. In Escherichia coli, 
the organism in which orisome assembly has been most thoroughly examined, the 
process starts with DnaA binding to high affinity sites after chromosome 
duplication is initiated, and orisome assembly is completed immediately before 
the next initiation event, when DnaA interacts with oriC's lower affinity sites, 
coincident with origin unwinding. A host of regulators, including several 
transcriptional modulators, targets low affinity DnaA-oriC interactions, 
exerting their effects by DNA bending, blocking access to recognition sites, 
and/or facilitating binding of DnaA to both DNA and itself. In this review, we 
focus on orisome assembly in E. coli. We identify three known transcriptional 
modulators, SeqA, Fis (factor for inversion stimulation), and IHF (integration 
host factor), that are not essential for initiation, but which interact directly 
with E. coli oriC to regulate orisome assembly and replication initiation 
timing. These regulators function by blocking sites (SeqA) and bending oriC DNA 
(Fis and IHF) to inhibit or facilitate cooperative low affinity DnaA binding. We 
also examine how the growth rate regulation of Fis levels might modulate IHF and 
DnaA binding to oriC under a variety of nutritional conditions. Combined, the 
regulatory mechanisms mediated by transcriptional modulators help ensure that at 
all growth rates, bacterial chromosome replication begins once, and only once, 
per cell cycle.

In Escherichia coli, repression of phosphatidylglycerol synthase A gene (pgsA) 
lowers the levels of membrane acidic phospholipids, particularly 
phosphatidylglycerol (PG), causing growth-arrested phenotype. The interrupted 
synthesis of PG is known to be associated with concomitant reduction of 
chromosomal content and cell mass, in addition to accumulation of unprocessed 
outer membrane lipoprotein intermediate, pro-Lpp, at the inner membrane. 
However, whether a linkage exists between the two altered-membrane outcomes 
remains unknown. Previously, it has been shown that pgsA + cells overexpressing 
mutant Lpp(C21G) protein have growth defects similar to those caused by the 
unprocessed pro-Lpp intermediate in cells lacking PG. Here, we found that the 
ectopic expression of DnaA(L366K) or deletion of fis (encoding Factor for 
Inversion Stimulation) permits growth of cells that otherwise would be arrested 
for growth due to accumulated Lpp(C21G). The DnaA(L366K)-mediated restoration of 
growth occurs by reduced expression of Lpp(C21G) via a σ E -dependent 
small-regulatory RNA (sRNA), MicL-S. In contrast, restoration of growth via fis 
deletion is only partially dependent on the MicL-S pathway; deletion of fis also 
rescues Lpp(C21G) growth arrest in cells lacking physiological levels of PG and 
cardiolipin (CL), independently of MicL-S. Our results suggest a close link 
between the physiological state of the bacterial cell membrane and DnaA- and 
Fis-dependent growth.

Low Affinity DnaA-ATP Recognition Sites in E. coli oriC Make Non-equivalent and 
Growth Rate-Dependent Contributions to the Regulated Timing of Chromosome 
Replication.

Although the mechanisms that precisely time initiation of chromosome replication 
in bacteria remain unclear, most clock models are based on accumulation of the 
active initiator protein, DnaA-ATP. During each cell division cycle, sufficient 
DnaA-ATP must become available to interact with a distinct set of low affinity 
recognition sites in the unique chromosomal replication origin, oriC, and 
assemble the pre-replicative complex (orisome) that unwinds origin DNA and helps 
load the replicative helicase. The low affinity oriC-DnaA-ATP interactions are 
required for the orisome's mechanical functions, and may also play a role in 
timing of new rounds of DNA synthesis. To further examine this possibility, we 
constructed chromosomal oriCs with equal preference for DnaA-ADP or DnaA-ATP at 
one or more low affinity recognition sites, thereby lowering the DnaA-ATP 
requirement for orisome assembly, and measured the effect of the mutations on 
cell cycle timing of DNA synthesis. Under slow growth conditions, mutation of 
any one of the six low affinity DnaA-ATP sites in chromosomal oriC resulted in 
initiation earlier in the cell cycle, but the shift was not equivalent for every 
recognition site. Mutation of τ2 caused a greater change in initiation age, 
suggesting its occupation by DnaA-ATP is a temporal bottleneck during orisome 
assembly. In contrast, during rapid growth, all origins with a single mutated 
site displayed wild-type initiation timing. Based on these observations, we 
propose that E. coli uses two different, DnaA-ATP-dependent initiation timing 
mechanisms; a slow growth timer that is directly coupled to individual site 
occupation, and a fast growth timer comprising DnaA-ATP and additional factors 
that regulate DnaA access to oriC. Analysis of origins with paired mutated sites 
suggests that Fis is an important component of the fast growth timing mechanism.

Expression of the quinolone resistance gene qnrS1 is increased by quinolones, 
but unlike induction of some other qnr genes, the bacterial SOS system is not 
involved and no lexA box is found upstream. Nonetheless, at least 205 bp of 
upstream sequence is required for induction to take place. An upstream sequence 
bound to beads trapped potential binding proteins from cell extracts that were 
identified by mass spectrometry as Dps, Fis, Ihf, Lrp, CysB, and YjhU. To 
further elucidate their role, a reporter plasmid linking the qnrS1 upstream 
sequence to lacZ was introduced into cells of the Keio collection with 
single-gene deletions and screened for lacZ expression. Mutants in ihfA and ihfB 
had decreased lacZ induction, while induction in a cysB mutant was increased and 
dps, fis, lrp, yjhU, and other mutants showed no change. The essential upstream 
sequence contains potential binding sites for Ihf and DnaA. A dnaA deletion 
could not be tested because it provides essential functions in cell replication; 
however, increased dnaA expression decreased qnrS1 induction while decreased 
dnaA expression enhanced it, implying a role for DnaA as a repressor. In a 
mobility shift assay, purified IhfA, IhfB, and DnaA proteins (but not CysB) were 
shown to bind to the upstream segment. Induction decreased in a gyrA 
quinolone-resistant mutant, indicating that GyrA also has a role. Thus, 
quinolones acting through proteins DnaA, GyrA, IhfA, and IhfB regulate 
expression of qnrS1.

In Escherichia coli, the initiator protein ATP-DnaA promotes initiation of 
chromosome replication in a timely manner. After initiation, DnaA-bound ATP is 
hydrolyzed to yield ADP-DnaA, which is inactive in initiation. DnaA-reactivating 
sequences (DARS1 and DARS2) on the chromosome have predominant roles in 
catalysis of nucleotide exchange, producing ATP-DnaA from ADP-DnaA, which is 
prerequisite for timely initiation. Both DARS sequences have a core region 
containing a cluster of three DnaA-binding sites. DARS2 is more effective 
in vivo than DARS1, and timely activation of DARS2 depends on binding of two 
nucleoid-associated proteins, IHF and Fis. DARS2 is located centrally between 
the chromosomal replication origin oriC and the terminus region terC. We 
constructed mutants in which DARS2 was translocated to several chromosomal loci, 
including sites proximal to oriC and to terC. Replication initiation was 
inhibited in cells in which DARS2 was translocated to terC-proximal sites when 
the cells were grown at 42 °C, although overall binding efficiency of IHF and 
Fis to the translocated DARS2 was not affected. Inhibition was largely sustained 
even in cells lacking MatP, a DNA-binding protein responsible for terC-specific 
subchromosomal structure. These results suggest that functional regulation of 
DARS2 is correlated with its chromosomal location under certain conditions.

In Escherichia coli, the ATP-bound form of DnaA (ATP-DnaA) promotes replication 
initiation. During replication, the bound ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP to yield the 
ADP-bound form (ADP-DnaA), which is inactive for initiation. The chromosomal 
site DARS2 facilitates the regeneration of ATP-DnaA by catalyzing nucleotide 
exchange between free ATP and ADP bound to DnaA. However, the regulatory 
mechanisms governing this exchange reaction are unclear. Here, using in vitro 
reconstituted experiments, we show that two nucleoid-associated proteins, IHF 
and Fis, bind site-specifically to DARS2 to activate coordinately the exchange 
reaction. The regenerated ATP-DnaA was fully active in replication initiation 
and underwent DnaA-ATP hydrolysis. ADP-DnaA formed heteromultimeric complexes 
with IHF and Fis on DARS2, and underwent nucleotide dissociation more 
efficiently than ATP-DnaA. Consistently, mutant analyses demonstrated that 
specific binding of IHF and Fis to DARS2 stimulates the formation of ATP-DnaA 
production, thereby promoting timely initiation. Moreover, we show that 
IHF-DARS2 binding is temporally regulated during the cell cycle, whereas Fis 
only binds to DARS2 in exponentially growing cells. These results elucidate the 
regulation of ATP-DnaA and replication initiation in coordination with the cell 
cycle and growth phase.

Building the bacterial orisome: high-affinity DnaA recognition plays a role in 
setting the conformation of oriC DNA.

During assembly of the E. coli pre-replicative complex (pre-RC), initiator DnaA 
oligomers are nucleated from three widely separated high-affinity DnaA 
recognition sites in oriC. Oligomer assembly is then guided by low-affinity DnaA 
recognition sites, but is also regulated by a switch-like conformational change 
in oriC mediated by sequential binding of two DNA bending proteins, Fis and IHF, 
serving as inhibitor and activator respectively. Although their recognition 
sites are separated by up to 90 bp, Fis represses IHF binding and weak DnaA 
interactions until accumulating DnaA displaces Fis from oriC. It remains unclear 
whether high-affinity DnaA binding plays any role in Fis repression at a 
distance and it is also not known whether all high-affinity DnaA recognition 
sites play an equivalent role in oligomer formation. To examine these issues, we 
developed origin-selective recombineering methods to mutate E. coli chromosomal 
oriC. We found that, although oligomers were assembled in the absence of any 
individual high-affinity DnaA binding site, loss of DnaA binding at peripheral 
sites eliminated Fis repression, and made binding of both Fis and IHF essential. 
We propose a model in which interaction of DnaA molecules at high-affinity sites 
regulates oriC DNA conformation.

H-NS is a novel transcriptional modulator of the ribonucleotide reductase genes 
in Escherichia coli.

Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are essential enzymes for DNA synthesis because 
they are responsible for the production of the four deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) 
from their corresponding ribonucleotides. Escherichia coli contains two classes 
of aerobic RNRs, encoded by the nrdAB (class Ia) and nrdHIEF (class Ib) operons, 
and a third RNR class, which is functional under anaerobic conditions and is 
encoded by the nrdDG (class III) operon. Because cellular imbalances in the 
amounts of the four dNTPs cause an increase in the rate of mutagenesis, the 
activity and the expression of RNRs must be tightly regulated during bacterial 
chromosome replication. The transcriptional regulation of these genes requires 
several transcription factors (including DnaA, IciA, FIS [factor for inversion 
stimulation], Fnr, Fur, and NrdR), depending on the RNR class; however, the 
factors that dictate the expression of some RNR genes in response to different 
environmental conditions are not known. We show that H-NS modulates the 
expression of the nrdAB and nrdDG operons. H-NS represses expression both in 
aerobically and in anaerobically growing cells. Under aerobic conditions, 
repression occurs at the exponential phase of growth as well as at the 
transition from the exponential to the stationary phase, a period when no dNTPs 
are needed. Under anoxic conditions, repression occurs mainly in exponentially 
growing cells. Electrophoretic mobility assays performed with two DNA fragments 
from the regulatory region of the nrdAB operon demonstrated the direct 
interaction of H-NS with these sequences.

Downregulation of the Escherichia coli guaB promoter by upstream-bound cyclic 
AMP receptor protein.

Husnain SI(1), Busby SJ, Thomas MS.

Author information:
(1)School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Sheffield, 
Sheffield, United Kingdom.

The Escherichia coli guaB promoter (P(guaB)) is responsible for directing 
transcription of the guaB and guaA genes, which specify the biosynthesis of the 
nucleotide GMP. P(guaB) is subject to growth rate-dependent control (GRDC) and 
possesses an UP element that is required for this regulation. In addition, 
P(guaB) contains a discriminator, three binding sites for the 
nucleoid-associated protein FIS, and putative binding sites for the regulatory 
proteins DnaA, PurR, and cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP). Here we show that 
the CRP-cyclic AMP (cAMP) complex binds to a site located over 100 bp upstream 
of the guaB transcription start site, where it serves to downregulate P(guaB). 
The CRP-mediated repression of P(guaB) activity increases in media that support 
lower growth rates. Inactivation of the crp or cyaA gene or 
ablation/translocation of the CRP site relieves repression by CRP and results in 
a loss of GRDC of P(guaB). Thus, GRDC of P(guaB) involves a progressive increase 
in CRP-mediated repression of the promoter as the growth rate decreases. Our 
results also suggest that the CRP-cAMP complex does not direct GRDC at P(guaB) 
and that at least one other regulatory factor is required for conferring GRDC on 
this promoter. However, PurR and DnaA are not required for this regulatory 
mechanism.

Fis protein forms DNA topological barriers to confine transcription-coupled DNA 
supercoiling in Escherichia coli.

Previously, we demonstrated that transcription-coupled DNA supercoiling (TCDS) 
potently activated or inhibited nearby promoters in Escherichia coli even in the 
presence of all four DNA topoisomerases, suggesting that DNA topoisomerases are 
not the only factors regulating TCDS. A different mechanism exists to confine 
this localized DNA supercoiling. Using an in vivo system containing the 
TCDS-activated leu-500 promoter (Pleu-500 ), we find that the 
nucleoid-associated Fis protein potently inhibits the TCDS-mediated activation 
of Pleu-500 . We also find that deletion of the fis gene significantly enhances 
TCDS-mediated inhibition of transcription of three genes purH, yieP, and yrdA 
divergently coupled to different rrn operons in the early log phase. These 
results suggest that Fis protein forms DNA topological barriers upon binding to

Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.

The acrS regulatory gene is located upstream of the acrEF multidrug efflux 
system genes. However, the roles of AcrS in regulation of drug efflux pumps have 
not been clearly understood. Here we show that AcrS represses other multidrug 
efflux genes, acrAB, which encode a major efflux system in Escherichia coli.

Regulation of jadomycin B production in Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230: 
involvement of a repressor gene, jadR2.

The nucleotide sequence of a region upstream of the type II polyketide synthase 
genes in the cluster for biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic jadomycin B 
in Streptomyces venezuelae contained an open reading frame encoding a sequence 
of 196 amino acids that resembeled sequences deduced for a group of repressor 
proteins. The strongest similarity was to EnvR of Escherichia coli, but the 
sequence also resembled MtrR, AcrR, TetC, and TcmR, all of which are involved in 
regulating resistance to antibiotics or toxic hydrophobic substances in the 
environment. Disruption of the nucleotide sequence of this putative S. 
venezuelae repressor gene (jadR2), by insertion of an apramycin resistance gene 
at an internal MluI site, and replacement of the chromosomal gene generated 
mutants that produced jadomycin B without the stress treatments (exposure to 
heat shock or to toxic concentrations of ethanol) required for jadomycin B 
production by the wild type. When cultures of the disruption mutants were 
ethanol stressed, they overproduced the antibiotic. From these results it was 
concluded that expression of the jadomycin B biosynthesis genes are negatively 
regulated by jadR2.

Bacterial cell-based biosensors have been widely developed for detecting 
environmental toxic materials. The znt-operon in Escherichia coli is a 
Zn(II)-responsive genetic system and is employed in Zn(II), Cd(II), and 
Hg(II)-sensing biosensors. In this study, point mutations were introduced in the 
regulatory protein ZntR to modulate its target selectivity, and metal 
ion-exporting genes, such as copA and zntA, in host cells were deleted to 
increase cellular metal ion levels and enhance specificity. Thus, the overall 
responses of the E. coli cell-based biosensors toward metal(loid) ions were 
increased, and their selectivity, which was originally for Cd(II) and Hg(II), 
was shifted to Pb(II). The gene encoding ZntA, known as the Zn(II)-translocating 
P-type ATPase, showed an impact on the ability of E. coli to export Pb(II), 
whereas copA deletion showed no significant impact. Noteworthily, the newly 
generated biosensors employing ZntR Cys115Ile showed the capacity to detect 
under 5 nM Pb(II) in solution, without response to other tested metal ions 
within 0-100 nM. To understand the marked effect of single point mutations on 
ZntR, computational modeling was employed. Although it did not provide clear 
answers, changes in the sequences of the metal-binding loops of ZntR modulated 
its transcriptional strength and target selectivity. In summary, the approaches 
proposed in this study can be valuable to generate new target-sensing biosensors 
with superior selectivity and specificity, which can in turn broaden the 
applicability of cell-based biosensors to monitor Pb(II) in environmental 
systems.

Despite the large number of bioreporters developed to date, the ability to 
detect heavy metal(loid)s with bioreporters has thus far been limited owing to 
the lack of appropriate genetic systems. We here present a novel approach to 
modulate the selectivity and sensitivity of microbial whole-cell bioreporters 
(WCBs) for sensing metal(loid)s via the znt-operon from Escherichia coli, which 
were applied to quantify the bioavailability of these contaminants in 
environmental samples. The WCB harboring the fusion gene zntAp::egfp was used as 
a microbial metal(loid) sensor, which was turned on by the interaction between 
ZntR and metal(loid) ions. This design makes it possible to modulate the 
selectivity and sensitivity to metal(loid)s simply by changing the metal-binding 
property of ZntR and by disrupting the metal efflux system of E. coli, 
respectively. In fact, the E. coli cell-based bioreporter harboring zntAp::egfp 
showed multi-target responses to Cd(II), Hg(II), and Zn(II). However, the WCBs 
showed responses toward only Cd(II) and Hg(II) when the amino acid sequence of 
the metal-binding loop of ZntR was changed to CNHEPGTVCPIC and CPGDDSADC, 
respectively. Moreover, the sensitivity toward both Cd(II) and Hg(II) was 
enhanced when copA, which is known to export copper and silver, was deleted. 
Thus, our findings provide a strong foundation for expanding the target of WCBs 
from the currently limited number of genetic systems available.

An atypical linear Cu(I)-S2 center constitutes the high-affinity metal-sensing

CueR is a copper-responsive genetic switch that regulates transcription of genes 
encoding the primary copper-exporting system in E. coli, CopA and CueO. Although 
a member of the MerR family of regulatory proteins, CueR has four cysteines in 
an array that is distinct from those in Hg(II)-sensing MerR or in Zn-sensing 
ZntR. A recent crystal structure showed one copper atom in CueR bound to 
cysteines Cys112 and Cys120 in a linear CuS2 structure, but left open the 
questions of whether the other half of the CueR dimer has the same structure, 
and of whether these structures depend on the two additional C-terminal 
cysteines. Metal binding, transcription runoff, and cysteine modification 
studies show that only Cys112 and Cys 120 are necessary and sufficient to make 
the transcriptionally active Cu-sensing site. X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
shows that this site binds Cu(I) in a strictly linear CuS2 site in solution, a 
structure that is rarely observed in copper proteins. This structure does not 
depend either on additional metal loading or upon the presence of additional 
C-terminal cysteine ligands and is well suited for an ultrasensitve receptor 
site that discriminates against the binding of other metal ions.

Metal sensing in Salmonella: implications for pathogenesis.

Osman D(1), Cavet JS.

Kingdom.

Both the essentiality and toxicity of transition metals are exploited as part of 
mammalian immune defenses against bacterial infection. Salmonella serovars 
continue to cause serious medical and veterinary problems worldwide and 
detecting deficiency and excess of different metal ions (such as copper, iron, 
zinc, manganese, nickel, and cobalt) is fundamental to their virulence. This 
involves multiple DNA-binding metal-responsive transcription factors that 
discriminate between elements and trigger expression of genes that mediate 
appropriate responses to metal fluxes. This review focuses on the metal stresses 
encountered by Salmonella during infection and the roles of the different 
metal-sensing regulatory proteins and their target genes in adapting to these 
changing metal levels. Current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of 
metal-regulated gene expression and the structural features of sensory metal 
binding sites are described. In addition, the principles governing the ability 
of the different sensors to detect specific metals within a cell to control 
cytosolic metal levels are also discussed. These proteins represent potential 
targets for the development of new therapeutic approaches.

Nucleotide sequence of the rpoA-rplQ DNA of Escherichia coli: a second 
regulatory binding site for protein S4?

Meek DW, Hayward RS.

The "alpha-operon" of E.coli is a unit of regulation comprising the following 
known genes, mostly encoding ribosomal proteins (in order of transcription, and 
with their products named in brackets): rpsM (S13), rpsK (S11), rpsD (S4), rpoA 
(alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase), rplQ (L17). There is evidence that S4 tightly 
regulates all of these genes, except rpoA, by repressing translation of the 
polycistronic mRNA. Binding of S4 to the S13 start-site is thought to regulate 
the first three genes. We have extended the 'rpsD-rpoA' sequences previously 
determined by others, to include all of rpoA and rplQ. The rpoA-rplQ 
intercistronic region shows strong primary, and potential secondary structural 
homologies with the S4-binding sites on 16S rRNA and S13 mRNA. We suggest that 
S4 represses L17 translation directly.

DNA sequence of the promoter region for the alpha ribosomal protein operon in 
Escherichia coli.

Post LE, Arfsten AE, Davis GR, Nomura M.

Previous studies showed that the gene for RNA polymerase subunit alpha at 72 min 
on the Escherichia coli chromosome is co-transcribed with genes for ribosomal 
proteins (r-proteins) S11, S4, and L17, and probably S13. DNA sequence analysis 
of a deletion mutant has now established that the S13 gene is a part of the 
alpha operon and the gene order is promoter (P alpha), rpsM (S13), rpsK (S11), 
rpsD(S4), rpoA(alpha), and rplQ(L17). The DNA sequence extending 650 bases 
before S13 gene was determined. In vitro transcription experiments establish the 
probable location of the alpha promoter (P alpha) within this sequence. The 
start site is 94 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon (GUG) of the S13 
gene. This promoter has features previously noted as common to E. coli 
promoters. However, comparison with four other sequenced promoters of r-protein 
operons shows no unique common features that might account for the common 
regulation of synthesis of r-proteins. This lack of sequence similarity in 
promoters of r-protein operons may be because r-protein synthesis is regulated 
at least partially at a post-transcriptional level.

Gene for the alpha subunit of Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase maps in the 
ribosomal protein gene cluster.

Suh JW, Boylan SA, Price CW.

We isolated the gene encoding the alpha subunit of Bacillus subtilis RNA 
polymerase from a lambda gt11 expression vector library by using anti-alpha 
antibody as a probe. Four unique clones were isolated, one carrying a lacZ-alpha 
gene fusion and three carrying the entire alpha coding region together with 
additional sequences upstream. The identity of the cloned alpha gene was 
confirmed by the size and immunological reactivity of its product expressed in 
Escherichia coli. Further, a partial DNA sequence found the predicted NH2 
terminus of alpha homologous with E. coli alpha. By plasmid integration and PBS1 
transduction, we mapped alpha near rpsE and within the major ribosomal protein 
gene cluster on the B. subtilis chromosome. Additional DNA sequencing identified 
rpsM (encoding S13) and rpsK (encoding S11) upstream of alpha, followed by a 
180-base-pair intercistronic region that may contain two alpha promoters. 
Although the organization of the alpha region resembles that of the alpha operon 
of E. coli, the putative promoters and absence of rpsD (encoding S4) immediately 
preceding the B. subtilis alpha gene suggest a different regulation.

Nucleotide sequence of the rpoA-rplQ DNA of Escherichia coli: a second 
regulatory binding site for protein S4?

Meek DW, Hayward RS.

The "alpha-operon" of E.coli is a unit of regulation comprising the following 
known genes, mostly encoding ribosomal proteins (in order of transcription, and 
with their products named in brackets): rpsM (S13), rpsK (S11), rpsD (S4), rpoA 
(alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase), rplQ (L17). There is evidence that S4 tightly 
regulates all of these genes, except rpoA, by repressing translation of the 
polycistronic mRNA. Binding of S4 to the S13 start-site is thought to regulate 
the first three genes. We have extended the 'rpsD-rpoA' sequences previously 
determined by others, to include all of rpoA and rplQ. The rpoA-rplQ 
intercistronic region shows strong primary, and potential secondary structural 
homologies with the S4-binding sites on 16S rRNA and S13 mRNA. We suggest that 
S4 represses L17 translation directly.

DNA sequence of the promoter region for the alpha ribosomal protein operon in 
Escherichia coli.

Post LE, Arfsten AE, Davis GR, Nomura M.

Previous studies showed that the gene for RNA polymerase subunit alpha at 72 min 
on the Escherichia coli chromosome is co-transcribed with genes for ribosomal 
proteins (r-proteins) S11, S4, and L17, and probably S13. DNA sequence analysis 
of a deletion mutant has now established that the S13 gene is a part of the 
alpha operon and the gene order is promoter (P alpha), rpsM (S13), rpsK (S11), 
rpsD(S4), rpoA(alpha), and rplQ(L17). The DNA sequence extending 650 bases 
before S13 gene was determined. In vitro transcription experiments establish the 
probable location of the alpha promoter (P alpha) within this sequence. The 
start site is 94 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon (GUG) of the S13 
gene. This promoter has features previously noted as common to E. coli 
promoters. However, comparison with four other sequenced promoters of r-protein 
operons shows no unique common features that might account for the common 
regulation of synthesis of r-proteins. This lack of sequence similarity in 
promoters of r-protein operons may be because r-protein synthesis is regulated 
at least partially at a post-transcriptional level.

The Xanthomonas campestris rpsM (S13)-rpsK (S11)-rpsD (S4)-rpoA (alpha)-rplQ 
(L17) cluster, encoding RNA polymerase alpha-subunit and four ribosomal 
proteins, reside in a 3164-bp DNA region. The N-terminal sequence of the 
authentic alpha-protein determined chemically matches that predicted from the

Many chromosomal genes modulate MarA-mediated multidrug resistance in 
Escherichia coli.

Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, 
USA.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli can be 
associated with overexpression of marA, a transcription factor that upregulates 
multidrug efflux and downregulates membrane permeability. Using random 
transposome mutagenesis, we found that many chromosomal genes and environmental 
stimuli affected MarA-mediated antibiotic resistance. Seven genes affected 
resistance mediated by MarA in an antibiotic-specific way; these were mostly 
genes encoding unrelated enzymes, transporters, and unknown proteins. Other 
genes affected MarA-mediated resistance to all antibiotics tested. These genes 
were acrA, acrB, and tolC (which encode the major MarA-regulated multidrug 
efflux pump AcrAB-TolC), crp, cyaA, hns, and pcnB (four genes involved in global 
regulation of gene expression), and the unknown gene damX. The last five genes 
affected MarA-mediated MDR by altering marA expression or MarA function 
specifically on acrA. These findings demonstrate that MarA-mediated MDR is 
regulated at multiple levels by different genes and stimuli, which makes it both 
complex and fine-tuned and interconnects it with global cell regulation and 
metabolism. Such a regulation could contribute to the adaptation and spread of 
MDR strains and may be targeted to treat antibiotic-resistant E. coli and 
related pathogens.

RATIONALE: Baseline circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) are 
significantly associated with cardiovascular disease risk in general 
populations. This modest association has been inappropriately conflated with 
causality, and it has been claimed that CRP is proatherogenic. Most of the known 
causative factors for atherosclerosis stimulate increased CRP production, but 
comprehensive genetic epidemiology studies provide no support for a pathogenic 
role of CRP. The reported proinflammatory effects of human CRP preparations on 
healthy cells in vitro and in healthy animals in vivo have all been produced by 
poorly characterized CRP preparations, demonstrably caused by impurities, or 
elicited by CRP made in recombinant Escherichia coli not by humans. None of the 
in vitro or animal findings have been reproduced with pure natural human CRP. 
Nevertheless, the strong proinflammatory effects of infusing recombinant 
bacterial CRP into humans have still been inappropriately ascribed to CRP.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of infusion into healthy adult human 
volunteers of pure natural human CRP.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Comprehensively characterized, pharmaceutical-grade, 
endotoxin-free, purified CRP, prepared to GMP standard from pooled normal human 
donor plasma was infused as an intravenous bolus in 7 healthy adult human 
volunteers at ≤2 mg/kg to provide circulating CRP concentrations ≤44 mg/L. No 
recipient showed any significant clinical, hematologic, coagulation, or 
biochemical changes, or any increase in proinflammatory cytokines or acute phase 
proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: The human CRP molecule itself is not proinflammatory in healthy 
human adults.

Serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and C-reactive protein in pediatric patients 
with sepsis and its correlation with microbiologic findings.

OBJECTIVE: To study the association of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and 
C--reactive protein (CRP) with microbiologically documented cases of sepsis 
versus clinically documented cases of sepsis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy nine pediatric patients with sepsis were studied. 
Relevant specimens were processed for bacterial or fungal etiology. TNF-a was 
detected by enzyme immunoassay and CRP was detected by latex agglutination. 
Thirty healthy cases were included in the study to establish baseline TNF-alpha 
levels.
RESULTS: Forty two (53.2%) patients had a microbiologically documented sepsis. 
Among Gram negative bacilli Escherichia coli was the most common isolate 
followed by Klebsiella spp. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae 
predominated among the Gram positive cocci. Patients with a positive culture had 
significantly higher TNF-alpha levels than patients with a negative culture (70 
pg/ml vs. 33 pg/ml P < 0.01). Further, pure gram negative infection correlated 
with significantly higher TNF-alpha levels than pure (P < 0.01) gram positive 
infection. The CRP values did not highlight these differences significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha level was significantly raised in patients with sepsis. 
TNF-a levels were raised significantly in culture positive cases in general and 
in Gram negative infections in particular. Serum TNF-alpha was a more sensitive 
marker for different categories of sepsis compared to CRP and microbiology 
culture.

Intravenous administration to human volunteers of a commercial preparation of 
recombinant human C-reactive protein (CRP) produced in Escherichia coli was 
recently reported in this journal to induce an acute phase response of serum 
amyloid A protein (SAA) and of CRP itself, and to activate the coagulation 
system. The authors concluded that CRP is probably a mediator of 
atherothrombotic disease. Here we confirm that this recombinant CRP preparation 
was proinflammatory both for mouse macrophages in vitro and for mice in vivo, 
but show that pure natural human CRP had no such activity. Furthermore mice 
transgenic for human CRP, and expressing it throughout their lives, maintained 
normal concentrations of their most sensitive endogenous acute phase reactants, 
SAA and serum amyloid P component (SAP). The patterns of in vitro cytokine 
induction and of in vivo acute phase stimulation by the recombinant CRP 
preparation were consistent with contamination by bacterial products, and there 
was 46.6 EU of apparent endotoxin activity per mg of CRP in the bacterial 
product, compared with 0.9 EU per mg of our isolated natural human CRP 
preparation. The absence of any proinflammatory activity in natural CRP for 
macrophages or healthy mice strongly suggests that the in vivo effects of the 
recombinant preparation observed in humans were attributable to proinflammatory 
bacterial products and not human CRP.

Exposure to endotoxin and to its purified derivative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is 
related to several occupational pulmonary diseases and to severe domestic 
asthma. An inhalation of a given dose of pure LPS produces both a systemic and a 
bronchial inflammatory response. Information on the dose-response relationship 
to inhaled LPS in normal subjects is a prerequisite to define the safety 
threshold of exposure. In the present study, the clinical and inflammatory 
responses to rising doses of inhaled LPS was evaluated. Nine normal volunteers 
were challenged weekly by inhalation with saline, 0.5, 5, and 50 microg LPS 
(Escherichia coli). The response determinators are the clinical symptoms, fever, 
FEV1, blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) with their level of activation 
(measured by luminol enhanced-chemiluminescence), and both the blood and the 
urine concentrations of the C-reactive protein (CRP). To assess the bronchial 
inflammatory response, an induced sputum was obtained 6 h after each dose of 
LPS, and the total and differential cell counts as well as the MPO, ECP, and 
TNF-alpha concentrations were measured. Compared with the saline, an inhalation 
of 0.5 microg LPS induces a significant decrease in the PMN luminol-enhanced 
chemiluminescence (p < 0.01), which could reflect a process of margination 
and/or extravascular sequestration of activated PMN. Inhalation of 5 microg LPS 
is associated with a significant rise in blood CRP (p < 0.01) and PMNs (p < 
0.001) and in sputum PMNs (p < 0.05), monocytes (p < 0.05), and MPO (p < 0.05). 
Inhalation of 50 microg LPS was characterized by a significant increase in 
temperature (p < 0.01), blood PMNs (p < 0.001), blood and urine CRP (p < 0.01 
and < 0.01), and sputum PMNs (p < 0.001), monocytes (p < 0.05), lymphocytes (p < 
0.05), MPO (p < 0.01), TNF-alpha (p < 0.01), and ECP (p < 0.01) while five 
subjects develop symptoms. In normal subjects, the response to inhaled LPS is 
dose-related, the most sensitive markers of LPS-induced inflammation being the 
blood PMNs count with their level of activation, the blood CRP concentration, 
and the sputum PMNs count. The no-response threshold to an acute inhalation of 
LPS is less than 0.5 microg.

The aldA gene of Escherichia coli is under the control of at least three 
transcriptional regulators.

Diagonal 643, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.

Expression studies on the aldA gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase in 
Escherichia coli showed induction by two types of molecule (hydroxyaldehydes and 
2-oxoglutarate), carbon catabolite repression and respiration dependence. 
Promoter deletion analysis showed that the proximal operator, which includes 
inducer-regulator complex and catabolite repression protein (Crp) recognition 
sites, was necessary for induction by either type of inducer, and that full 
induction by aldehydes required the cooperation of distal operator sequences 
beyond position -119. Interactions of the regulator protein with the -59 to -6 
fragment were shown by DNA mobility shift assays. Fusions of different deletions 
of the aldA promoter to lacZ indicated that a Crp site proximal to the 
transcriptional start point (tsp) was functional in the cAMP-dependent 
catabolite repression of this system, whereas a distal control site was likely 
to operate in a cAMP-independent catabolite repression. DNA mobility shift and 
footprint analyses showed that only the tsp proximal site was bound by pure Crp 
with a Kd of 5.4 x 10(-7) M. As shown by an Arc-defective strain, the aldA gene 
seems to be repressed by the Arc system under anaerobiosis, displaying its 
physiological full induction and activity in the presence of oxygen.

Control of the lux regulon of Vibrio fischeri.

Shadel GS(1), Devine JH, Baldwin TO.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Texas A & M University, College 
Station 77843.

Regulation of expression of bioluminescence from the Vibrio fischeri lux regulon 
in Escherichia coli is a consequence of a unique form of positive feedback 
superimposed on a poorly defined cis-acting repression mechanism. The lux 
regulon consists of two divergently transcribed operons. The leftward operon 
contains only a single gene, luxR, which encodes a transcriptional activator 
protein. The rightward operon contains luxI, which together with luxR and the 
218 base pairs separating the two operons comprises the primary regulatory 
circuit, and the five structural genes, luxC, luxD, luxA, luxB and luxE, which 
are required for the bioluminescence activity. Transcription of luxR from PL is 
stimulated by binding of the E. coli crp gene product to the sequence 
TGTGACAAAAATCCAA upstream of the presumed promoter. Binding of pure E. coli CAP 
protein in a cAMP-dependent reaction to the V. fischeri lux regulatory region 
has been demonstrated by in vitro footprinting. The luxI gene product is an 
enzyme which catalyses a condensation reaction of cytoplasmic substrates to 
yield the autoinducer, N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl) homoserine lactone. Accumulation of 
autoinducer, which is freely diffusible, results in formation of a complex with 
LuxR. The complex binds to the sequence ACCTGTAGGATCGTACAGGT upstream of PR to 
stimulate transcription of the rightward operon. Increased transcription from PR 
should yield increased levels of LuxI and higher levels of autoinducer which 
would further activate LuxR. The LuxR binding site is also a LexA binding site, 
as demonstrated by in vitro footprinting. Basal transcription from both PL and 
PR is repressed by sequences within the luxR coding region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

Isolation and characterization of purine regulatory mutants of Salmonella 
typhimurium with an episomal purE-lac fusion.

Thomulka KW, Gots JS.

Expression of the purE operon of Salmonella typhimurium was analyzed by using an 
Escherichia coli F' episome containing a purE-lac fusion. The fusion removes the 
lacOP and part of the lacZ genes of the lac operon and places the intact lacY 
and lacA genes under control of the purE operon as shown by inhibition of growth 
on melibiose (lacY) and repression of thiogalactoside transacetylase (lacA) by 
various purines. Two classes of regulatory-deficient mutants were found among 
those resistant to inhibition by purines. One class was trans active 
(chromosomal) and corresponded to previously described purR mutants involving a 
deficient cytoplasmic repressor substance. These were also altered in the 
expression of the purF, purD, purG amd purI genes as evidenced by loss of 
repressibility of the synthesis of glycinamide ribotide and aminoimidazole 
ribotide. The other class was cis active (episomal), specific for only purE 
expression, and thus corresponded to an altered purE operon signal (operator or 
promoter). The metabolic requirements for the expression of purE were also 
monitored by measuring repression of the transacetylase in strains with various 
genetically altered metabolic backgrounds. Repression by guanine required an 
intact guanine phosphorbosyltransferase (gpt) and repression by adenine and all 
nucleosides required purine nucleoside phosphorylase (deoD). Synthesis of cyclic 
AMP (cya) and its receptor protein (crp) were no longer required for the 
expression of the lac genes under purE control.

Large quantities of pure DNA fragments (789, 203 and 95 bp in length) containing 
the Escherichia coli lac controlling elements (operator, promoter, CRP binding 
site) were prepared from appropriate recombinant plasmids. High pressure liquid 
chromatography on RPC-5 or preparative sucrose gradient centrifugation was used 
to fractionate the pVH51 vector from the inserts. The fragments had few, if any, 
nicks or depurinated sites, and the majority of the fragment ends were intact. 
Absorbance-temperature profiles on the fragments showed multiphasic transitions.

In a phase 1 study of recombinant interleukin-6 (rIL-6) in patients with 
advanced solid tumors (n = 15), we discovered that the endogenous IL-6 levels, 
in pretreatment plasma or serum samples, were distributed into two groups. One 
set of patients (designated "type 1"; n = 9) was characterized by low plasma 
IL-6 levels (48 to 1,700 pg/mL) as measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays (ELISA) for IL-6. In the second set of patients (designated "type 2"; n = 
6), IL-6 ELISAs showed high levels of plasma IL-6 (50 to 600 ng/mL). Neither 
group had detectable B9 hybridoma cell growth factor activity associated with 
the IL-6 in their pretreatment plasma or serum. Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) 
levels were markedly elevated in type II patients suggesting that the 
circulating IL-6 was biologically active in vivo. In both groups of patients 
there was a small but significant increase in B9 activity in the plasma within 
three hours after rIL-6 administration (n = 5). Gel filtration profiles showed 
that circulating IL-6 in type 1 patients, 15 to 120 minutes after rIL-6 
administration was of approximate mass 20 to 40 kD, whereas in type 2 patients, 
the IL-6 before and after exogenous rIL-6 administration was indistinguishable 
and was of an approximate mass of 200 kD. IL-6 immunoaffinity purification of 
the 200 kD complexes showed these to contain multiple isoforms of IL-6 (14 to 31 
kD) and the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R; 50 to 55 kD). A distinguishing 
clinical history was that all of the type 2 patients had been actively immunized 
with an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody (MoAb) (MK2-23) 3 to 12 months before 
initiation of this study for advanced melanoma. An analysis of the plasma IL-6 
content in other melanoma patients (n = 16) during antiidiotypic MoAb 
immunization indicated that marked (up to 600 ng/mL) and sustained (several 
months) elevations of circulating "chaperoned" IL-6 were induced by active 
immunization regimens.

An experimental human challenge model with an attenuated diarrheagenic 
Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain has been used in food intervention studies 
aimed to increase resistance to E. coli infection. This study was designed to 
refine and expand this challenge model. In a double-blind study, healthy male 
subjects were orally challenged with 1E10 or 5E10 colony-forming units (CFU) of 
E. coli strain E1392/75-2A. Three weeks later, subjects were rechallenged with 
1E10 CFU of E. coli. Before and after both challenges, clinical symptoms and 
infection- and immune-related biomarkers were analyzed. Subset analysis was 
performed on clinically high- and low-responders. Regardless of inoculation 
dose, the first challenge induced clinical symptoms for 2-3 days. In blood, 
neutrophils, CRP, CXCL10, and CFA/II-specific IgG were induced, and in feces 
calprotectin and CFA/II-specific IgA. Despite clinical differences between high- 
and low-responders, infection and immune biomarkers did not differ. The first 
inoculation induced protection at the second challenge, with a minor clinical 
response, and no change in biomarkers. The refined study design resulted in a 
larger dynamic range of symptoms, and identification of biomarkers induced by a 
challenge with the attenuated E. coli strain E1392/75-2A, which is of value for 
future intervention studies. Addition of a second inoculation allows to study 
the protective response induced by a primary infection.Clinicaltrials.gov

and Fur, in Escherichia coli.

In Escherichia coli, the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) controls expression of 
the iron regulon in response to iron availability while the cyclic AMP receptor 
protein (Crp) regulates expression of the carbon regulon in response to carbon 
availability. We here identify genes subject to significant changes in 
expression level in response to the loss of both Fur and Crp. Many iron 
transport genes and several carbon metabolic genes are subject to dual control, 
being repressed by the loss of Crp and activated by the loss of Fur. However, 
the sodB gene, encoding superoxide dismutase, and the aceBAK operon, encoding 
the glyoxalate shunt enzymes, show the opposite responses, being activated by 
the loss of Crp and repressed by the loss of Fur. Several other genes including 
the sdhA-D, sucA-D, and fumA genes, encoding key constituents of the Krebs 
cycle, proved to be repressed by the loss of both transcription factors. 
Finally, the loss of both Crp and Fur activated a heterogeneous group of genes 
under sigmaS control encoding, for example, the cyclopropane fatty acid 
synthase, Cfa, the glycogen synthesis protein, GlgS, the 30S ribosomal protein, 
S22, and the mechanosensitive channel protein, YggB. Many genes appeared to be 
regulated by the two transcription factors in an apparently additive fashion, 
but apparent positive or negative cooperativity characterized several putative 
Crp/Fur interactions. Relevant published data were evaluated, putative Crp and 
Fur binding sites were identified, and representative results were confirmed by 
real-time PCR. Molecular explanations for some, but not all, of these effects 
are provided.

BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance poses a great threat to global public health. 
Overuse of antibiotics is generally considered as the major factor contributing 
to it. However, little is known about whether non-antibiotic drugs could play 
potential roles in the emergence of antibiotic resistance.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether antidepressant fluoxetine induces 
multiple antibiotic resistances and reveal underlying mechanisms.
METHODOLOGY: Escherichia coli K12 was exposed to different concentrations of 
fluoxetine (0, 0.5, 5, 50 and 100 mg/L) and the resistant strains were isolated 
by plating on antibiotic containing plates. Resistant strains were randomly 
selected to determine the increase of minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 
multiple antibiotics. Genome-wide DNA sequencing was performed on cells cultured 
in lysogeny broth (LB) without any fluoxetine or antibiotics exposure. RNA 
sequencing and proteomic profiling of isolated mutants grown in LB with 100 mg/L 
fluoxetine were analyzed to reveal the underlying mechanisms.
RESULTS: Exposure of Escherichia coli to fluoxetine at 5-100 mg/L after repeated 
subculture in LB for 30 days promoted its mutation frequency resulting in 
increased resistance against the antibiotics chloramphenicol, amoxicillin and 
tetracycline. This increase was up to 5.0 × 107 fold in a dose-time pattern. 
Isolated mutants with resistance to one of these antibiotics also exhibited 
multiple resistances against fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, β-lactams, 
tetracycline and chloramphenicol. According to global transcriptional and 
proteomic analyses, the AcrAB-TolC pump together with the YadG/YadH transporter, 
a Tsx channel and the MdtEF-TolC pump have been triggered to export the 
antibiotics to the exterior of the cell. Whole-genome DNA analysis of the 
mutants further revealed that ROS-mediated mutagenesis (e.g., deletion, 
insertion, and substitution) of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators (e.g., 
marR, rob, sdiA, cytR and crp) to up-regulate the expression of efflux pumps, 
may further enhance the antibiotic efflux.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings for the first time demonstrated that the exposure to 
antidepressant fluoxetine induces multiple antibiotic resistance in E. coli via 
the ROS-mediated mutagenesis.

The multifunctional protein YdiV represses P fimbria-mediated adherence in 
uropathogenic Escherichia coli.

School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

YdiV, a degenerate EAL domain protein, represses motility by interacting with 
FlhD to abolish FlhDC interaction with DNA. Here, we demonstrate that deletion 
of ydiV dysregulates coordinate control of motility and adherence by increasing 
adherence of Escherichia coli CFT073 to a bladder epithelial cell line by 
specifically increasing production of P fimbriae. Interestingly, only one of the 
two P fimbrial operons, pap_2, present in the genome of E. coli CFT073 was 
upregulated. This derepression of the pap_2 operon is abolished following 
deletion of either cya or crp, demonstrating cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent 
activation of the P fimbrial operon. However, the absence of YdiV does not 
affect the gene expression of cya and crp, and loss of SdiA in the ydiV mutant 
does not affect the derepression of the pap_2 operon, suggesting that YdiV 
control of adherence acts in response to cAMP levels. Deletion of ydiV increases 
motility by increasing expression of fliA, suggesting that in E. coli CFT073, 
YdiV regulates motility by the same mechanism as that described previously for 
commensal E. coli strains. Furthermore, analysis of site-directed mutations 
found two putative Mg(2+)-binding residues of four conserved YdiV residues (E29 
and Q219) that were involved in regulation of motility and FliC production, 
while two conserved c-di-GMP-binding residues (D156 and D165) only affected 
motility. None of the four conserved YdiV residues appeared to affect regulation 
of adherence. Therefore, we propose a model in which a degenerate EAL, YdiV, 
utilizes different domains to regulate motility through interaction with FlhD 
and adherence to epithelial cells through cAMP-dependent effects on the pap_2 
promoter.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting quorum signaling.

Indole production by Escherichia coli, discovered in the early 20th century, has 
been used as a diagnostic marker for distinguishing E. coli from other enteric 
bacteria. By using transcriptional profiling and competition studies with 
defined mutants, we show that cyclic AMP (cAMP)-regulated indole formation is a 
major factor that enables E. coli growth in mixed biofilm and planktonic 
populations with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mutants deficient in cAMP production 
(cyaA) or the cAMP receptor gene (crp), as well as indole production (tnaA), 
were not competitive in coculture with P. aeruginosa but could be restored to 
wild-type competitiveness by supplementation with a physiologically relevant 
indole concentration. E. coli sdiA mutants, which lacked the receptor for both 
indole and N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), showed no change in competitive 
fitness, suggesting that indole acted directly on P. aeruginosa. An E. coli tnaA 
mutant strain regained wild-type competiveness if grown with P. aeruginosa AHL 
synthase (rhlI and rhlI lasI) mutants. In contrast to the wild type, P. 
aeruginosa AHL synthase mutants were unable to degrade indole. Indole produced 
during mixed-culture growth inhibited pyocyanin production and other 
AHL-regulated virulence factors in P. aeruginosa. Mixed-culture growth with P. 
aeruginosa stimulated indole formation in E. coli cpdA, which is unable to 
regulate cAMP levels, suggesting the potential for mixed-culture gene activation 
via cAMP. These findings illustrate how indole, an early described feature of E. 
coli central metabolism, can play a significant role in mixed-culture survival 
by inhibiting quorum-regulated competition factors in P. aeruginosa.

Quorum sensing (QS) is a bacterial cell-cell communication process by which 
bacteria communicate using extracellular signals called autoinducers. Two QS 
systems have been identified in Escherichia coli K-12, including an intact QS 
system 2 that is stimulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 
complex and a partial QS system 1 that consists of SdiA (suppressor of cell 
division inhibitor) responding to signals generated by other microbial species. 
The relationship between QS system 1 and system 2 in E. coli, however, remains 
obscure. Here, we show that an EAL domain protein, encoded by ydiV, and cAMP are 
involved in the interaction between the two QS systems in E. coli. Expression of 
sdiA and ydiV is inhibited by glucose. SdiA binds to the ydiV promoter region in 
a dose-dependent, but nonspecific, manner; extracellular autoinducer 1 from 
other species stimulates ydiV expression in an sdiA-dependent manner. 
Furthermore, we discovered that the double sdiA-ydiV mutation, but not the 
single mutation, causes a 2-fold decrease in intracellular cAMP concentration 
that leads to the inhibition of QS system 2. These results indicate that 
signaling pathways that respond to important environmental cues, such as 
autoinducers and glucose, are linked together for their control in E. coli.

The secondary messenger ppGpp interferes with cAMP-CRP regulon by promoting CRP 
acetylation in Escherichia coli.

The cAMP-CRP regulon coordinates transcription regulation of several 
energy-related genes, the lac operon among them. Lactose, or IPTG, induces the 
lac operon expression by binding to the LacI repressor, and releasing it from 
the promoter sequence. At the same time, the expression of the lac operon 
requires the presence of the CRP-cAMP complex, which promotes the binding of the 
RNA polymerase to the promoter region. The modified nucleotide cAMP accumulates 
in the absence of glucose and binds to the CRP protein, but its ability to bind 
to DNA can be impaired by lysine-acetylation of CRP. Here we add another layer 
of control, as acetylation of CRP seems to be modified by ppGpp. In cells grown 
in glycerol minimal media, ppGpp seems to repress the expression of lacZ, where 
ΔrelA mutants show higher expression of lacZ than in WT. These differences 
between the WT and ΔrelA strains seem to depend on the levels of acetylated CRP. 
During the growth in minimal media supplemented with glycerol, ppGpp promotes 
the acetylation of CRP by the Nε-lysine acetyltransferases YfiQ. Moreover, the 
expression of the different genes involved in the production and degradation of 
Acetyl-phosphate (ackA-pta) and the enzymatic acetylation of proteins (yfiQ) are 
stimulated by the presence of ppGpp, depending on the growth conditions.

Phosphate is one of the major constituents in growth media. It closely regulates 
central carbon and energy metabolism. Biochemical reactions in central carbon 
metabolism are known to be regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of 
enzymes. Phosphate scarcity can limit microbial productivity. However, 
microorganisms are evolved to grow in phosphate starvation environments. This 
study investigates the effect of phosphate-starved response (PSR) stimuli in 
wild-type and recombinant Escherichia coli cells cultivated in two different 
substrates, lactose, and glycerol. Phosphate-starved E. coli culture sustained 
bacterial growth despite the metabolic burden that emanated from recombinant 
protein expression albeit with altered dynamics of substrate utilisation. 
Induction of lactose in phosphate-starved culture led to a 2-fold improvement in 
product titre of rSymlin and a 2.3-fold improvement in product titre of rLTNF as 
compared with phosphate-unlimited culture. The results obtained in the study are 
in agreement with the literature to infer that phosphate starvation or 
limitation can slow down the microbial growth rate in order to produce 
recombinant proteins. Further, under PSR conditions, gene expression analysis 
demonstrated that while selected genes (gapdh, pykF, ppsA, icdA) in glycolysis 
and pentose phosphate pathway (zwf, gnd, talB, tktA) were up-regulated, other 
genes in lactose (lacY, lacA) and acetate (ackA, pta) pathway were 
down-regulated. We have demonstrated that cra, crp, phoB, and phoR are involved 
in the regulation of central carbon metabolism. We propose a novel 
cross-regulation between lactose metabolism and phosphate starvation. 
UDP-galactose, a toxic metabolite that is known to cause cell lysis, has been 
shown to be significantly reduced due to slow uptake of lactose under PSR 
conditions. Therefore, E. coli employs a decoupling strategy by limiting growth 
and redirecting metabolic resources to survive and produce recombinant protein 
under phosphate starvation conditions. KEY POINTS: • Phosphate starvation 
controls lactose metabolism, which results in less galactose accumulation. • 
Phosphate starvation modulates metabolic flow of central carbon metabolism. • 
Product titre improves by 2-fold due to phosphate starvation. • The approach has 
been successfully applied to production of two different proteins.

The metabolic potential of Escherichia coli BL21 in defined and rich medium.

BACKGROUND: The proteome reflects the available cellular machinery to deal with 
nutrients and environmental challenges. The most common E. coli strain BL21 
growing in different, commonly employed media was evaluated using a detailed 
quantitative proteome analysis.
RESULTS: The presence of preformed biomass precursor molecules in rich media 
such as Luria Bertani supported rapid growth concomitant to acetate formation 
and apparently unbalanced abundances of central metabolic pathway enzymes, e.g. 
high levels of lower glycolytic pathway enzymes as well as pyruvate 
dehydrogenase, and low levels of TCA cycle and high levels of the acetate 
forming enzymes Pta and AckA. The proteome of cells growing exponentially in 
glucose-supplemented mineral salt medium was dominated by enzymes of amino acid 
synthesis pathways, contained more balanced abundances of central metabolic 
pathway enzymes, and a lower portion of ribosomal and other translational 
proteins. Entry into stationary phase led to a reconstruction of the bacterial 
proteome by increasing e.g. the portion of proteins required for scavenging rare 
nutrients and general cell protection. This proteomic reconstruction during 
entry into stationary phase was more noticeable in cells growing in rich medium 
as they have a greater reservoir of recyclable proteins from the translational 
machinery.
CONCLUSIONS: The proteomic comparison of cells growing exponentially in 
different media reflected the antagonistic and competitive regulation of central 
metabolic pathways through the global transcriptional regulators Cra, Crp, and 
ArcA. For example, the proteome of cells growing exponentially in rich medium 
was consistent with a dominating role of phosphorylated ArcA most likely a 
result from limitations in reoxidizing reduced quinones in the respiratory chain 
under these growth conditions. The proteomic alterations of exponentially 
growing cells into stationary phase cells were consistent with stringent-like 
and stationary phase responses and a dominating control through DksA-ppGpp and 
RpoS.

Autoinducer 2 activity in Escherichia coli culture supernatants can be actively 
reduced despite maintenance of an active synthase, LuxS.

Production of the signalling molecule (autoinducer-2) synthesized by LuxS has 
been proposed to be pivotal to a universal mechanism of inter-species bacterial 
cell-cell communication (quorum sensing); however recently the function of LuxS 
has been noted to be integral to central metabolism since it contributes to the 
activated methyl cycle. This paper shows that when Helicobacter pylori LuxS is 
overproduced in Escherichia coli, it forms cross-linkable multimers. These 
multimers persist at comparable levels after 24 h of growth if glucose is 
omitted from the growth medium; however, the levels of extracellular 
autoinducer-2 decline (Glucose Retention of AI-2 Levels: GRAIL). Glycerol, 
maltose, galactose, ribose and L-arabinose could substitute for glucose, but 
lactose, D-arabinose, acetate, citrate and pyruvate could not. Mutations in (i). 
metabolic pathways (glycolytic enzymes eno, pgk, pgm; galactose epimerase; the 
Pta-AckA pathway), (ii). sugar transport (pts components, rbs operon, mgl, trg), 
and (iii). regulators involved in conventional catabolic repression (crp, cya), 
cAMP-independent catabolite repression (creC, fruR, rpoS,) the stringent 
response (relA, spoT) and the global carbon storage regulator (csrA) did not 
prevent GRAIL. Although the basis of GRAIL remains uncertain, it is clear that 
the mechanism is distinct from conventional catabolite repression. Moreover, 
GRAIL is not due to inactivation of the enzymic activity of LuxS, since in E. 
coli, LuxS contained within stationary-phase cells grown in the absence of 
glucose maintains its activity in vitro.

(prothrombin activity (PTA), albumin (propagated), white blood cell count (WBC), 
red blood cell count (RBC), plasma fibrinogen (FIB), C-reactive protein (CRP), 
neutrophil percentage (NEUT), and prealbumin (PA)) levels, blood cultivation, 
and fester situation in the two groups were analyzed.
RESULTS: No differences of Fever, right upper abdominal pain, jaundice, vomiting

between the study and control groups. However, chill, cough and expectoration, 
and liver pain upon percussion were higher in the study group, while abdominal 
distension was lower. WBC, RBC, PA, PTA, FIB, and CRP were higher than the 
control group. NEUT was higher in the study group than in the control group and 
Alb was lower than that in the control group. There was no significant 
difference between the positivity of blood bacterial culture in the study and 
control groups. The positivity rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae in Gram-negative 
aerobic bacteria in the study group was higher than that in the control group. 
There was no significant difference between the positivity of fester culture of 
the two groups. The positivity of K. pneumoniae in Gram-negative aerobic 
bacteria in the study group was higher than that in the control group. The 
positivity of E. coli was lower in the study group than in the control group.
CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations and laboratory results of BLA patients with 
and without diabetes mellitus were significantly different. The symptoms of 
diabetics with BLA were serious.

The secondary messenger ppGpp interferes with cAMP-CRP regulon by promoting CRP 
acetylation in Escherichia coli.

The cAMP-CRP regulon coordinates transcription regulation of several 
energy-related genes, the lac operon among them. Lactose, or IPTG, induces the 
lac operon expression by binding to the LacI repressor, and releasing it from 
the promoter sequence. At the same time, the expression of the lac operon 
requires the presence of the CRP-cAMP complex, which promotes the binding of the 
RNA polymerase to the promoter region. The modified nucleotide cAMP accumulates 
in the absence of glucose and binds to the CRP protein, but its ability to bind 
to DNA can be impaired by lysine-acetylation of CRP. Here we add another layer 
of control, as acetylation of CRP seems to be modified by ppGpp. In cells grown 
in glycerol minimal media, ppGpp seems to repress the expression of lacZ, where 
ΔrelA mutants show higher expression of lacZ than in WT. These differences 
between the WT and ΔrelA strains seem to depend on the levels of acetylated CRP. 
During the growth in minimal media supplemented with glycerol, ppGpp promotes 
the acetylation of CRP by the Nε-lysine acetyltransferases YfiQ. Moreover, the 
expression of the different genes involved in the production and degradation of 
Acetyl-phosphate (ackA-pta) and the enzymatic acetylation of proteins (yfiQ) are 
stimulated by the presence of ppGpp, depending on the growth conditions.

Phosphate is one of the major constituents in growth media. It closely regulates 
central carbon and energy metabolism. Biochemical reactions in central carbon 
metabolism are known to be regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of 
enzymes. Phosphate scarcity can limit microbial productivity. However, 
microorganisms are evolved to grow in phosphate starvation environments. This 
study investigates the effect of phosphate-starved response (PSR) stimuli in 
wild-type and recombinant Escherichia coli cells cultivated in two different 
substrates, lactose, and glycerol. Phosphate-starved E. coli culture sustained 
bacterial growth despite the metabolic burden that emanated from recombinant 
protein expression albeit with altered dynamics of substrate utilisation. 
Induction of lactose in phosphate-starved culture led to a 2-fold improvement in 
product titre of rSymlin and a 2.3-fold improvement in product titre of rLTNF as 
compared with phosphate-unlimited culture. The results obtained in the study are 
in agreement with the literature to infer that phosphate starvation or 
limitation can slow down the microbial growth rate in order to produce 
recombinant proteins. Further, under PSR conditions, gene expression analysis 
demonstrated that while selected genes (gapdh, pykF, ppsA, icdA) in glycolysis 
and pentose phosphate pathway (zwf, gnd, talB, tktA) were up-regulated, other 
genes in lactose (lacY, lacA) and acetate (ackA, pta) pathway were 
down-regulated. We have demonstrated that cra, crp, phoB, and phoR are involved 
in the regulation of central carbon metabolism. We propose a novel 
cross-regulation between lactose metabolism and phosphate starvation. 
UDP-galactose, a toxic metabolite that is known to cause cell lysis, has been 
shown to be significantly reduced due to slow uptake of lactose under PSR 
conditions. Therefore, E. coli employs a decoupling strategy by limiting growth 
and redirecting metabolic resources to survive and produce recombinant protein 
under phosphate starvation conditions. KEY POINTS: • Phosphate starvation 
controls lactose metabolism, which results in less galactose accumulation. • 
Phosphate starvation modulates metabolic flow of central carbon metabolism. • 
Product titre improves by 2-fold due to phosphate starvation. • The approach has 
been successfully applied to production of two different proteins.

BACKGROUND: The proteome reflects the available cellular machinery to deal with 
nutrients and environmental challenges. The most common E. coli strain BL21 
growing in different, commonly employed media was evaluated using a detailed 
quantitative proteome analysis.
RESULTS: The presence of preformed biomass precursor molecules in rich media 
such as Luria Bertani supported rapid growth concomitant to acetate formation 
and apparently unbalanced abundances of central metabolic pathway enzymes, e.g. 
high levels of lower glycolytic pathway enzymes as well as pyruvate 
dehydrogenase, and low levels of TCA cycle and high levels of the acetate 
forming enzymes Pta and AckA. The proteome of cells growing exponentially in 
glucose-supplemented mineral salt medium was dominated by enzymes of amino acid 
synthesis pathways, contained more balanced abundances of central metabolic 
pathway enzymes, and a lower portion of ribosomal and other translational 
proteins. Entry into stationary phase led to a reconstruction of the bacterial 
proteome by increasing e.g. the portion of proteins required for scavenging rare 
nutrients and general cell protection. This proteomic reconstruction during 
entry into stationary phase was more noticeable in cells growing in rich medium 
as they have a greater reservoir of recyclable proteins from the translational 
machinery.
CONCLUSIONS: The proteomic comparison of cells growing exponentially in 
different media reflected the antagonistic and competitive regulation of central 
metabolic pathways through the global transcriptional regulators Cra, Crp, and 
ArcA. For example, the proteome of cells growing exponentially in rich medium 
was consistent with a dominating role of phosphorylated ArcA most likely a 
result from limitations in reoxidizing reduced quinones in the respiratory chain 
under these growth conditions. The proteomic alterations of exponentially 
growing cells into stationary phase cells were consistent with stringent-like 
and stationary phase responses and a dominating control through DksA-ppGpp and 
RpoS.

approach using computer simulation.

It is quite important to understand the basic principle embedded in the main 
metabolism for the interpretation of the fermentation data. For this, it may be 
useful to understand the regulation mechanism based on systems biology approach. 
In the present study, we considered the perturbation analysis together with 
computer simulation based on the models which include the effects of global 
regulators on the pathway activation for the main metabolism of Escherichia 
coli. Main focus is the acetate overflow metabolism and the co-fermentation of 
multiple carbon sources. The perturbation analysis was first made to understand 
the nature of the feed-forward loop formed by the activation of Pyk by FDP 
(F1,6BP), and the feed-back loop formed by the inhibition of Pfk by PEP in the 
glycolysis. Those together with the effect of transcription factor Cra caused by 
FDP level affected the glycolysis activity. The PTS (phosphotransferase system) 
acts as the feed-back system by repressing the glucose uptake rate for the 
increase in the glucose uptake rate. It was also shown that the increased PTS 
flux (or glucose consumption rate) causes PEP/PYR ratio to be decreased, and 
EIIA-P, Cya, cAMP-Crp decreased, where cAMP-Crp in turn repressed TCA cycle and 
more acetate is formed. This was further verified by the detailed computer 
simulation. In the case of multiple carbon sources such as glucose and xylose, 
it was shown that the sequential utilization of carbon sources was observed for 
wild type, while the co-consumption of multiple carbon sources with slow 
consumption rates were observed for the ptsG mutant by computer simulation, and 
this was verified by experiments. Moreover, the effect of a specific gene 
knockout such as Δpyk on the metabolic characteristics was also investigated 
based on the computer simulation.

Autoinducer 2 activity in Escherichia coli culture supernatants can be actively 
reduced despite maintenance of an active synthase, LuxS.

Production of the signalling molecule (autoinducer-2) synthesized by LuxS has 
been proposed to be pivotal to a universal mechanism of inter-species bacterial 
cell-cell communication (quorum sensing); however recently the function of LuxS 
has been noted to be integral to central metabolism since it contributes to the 
activated methyl cycle. This paper shows that when Helicobacter pylori LuxS is 
overproduced in Escherichia coli, it forms cross-linkable multimers. These 
multimers persist at comparable levels after 24 h of growth if glucose is 
omitted from the growth medium; however, the levels of extracellular 
autoinducer-2 decline (Glucose Retention of AI-2 Levels: GRAIL). Glycerol, 
maltose, galactose, ribose and L-arabinose could substitute for glucose, but 
lactose, D-arabinose, acetate, citrate and pyruvate could not. Mutations in (i). 
metabolic pathways (glycolytic enzymes eno, pgk, pgm; galactose epimerase; the 
Pta-AckA pathway), (ii). sugar transport (pts components, rbs operon, mgl, trg), 
and (iii). regulators involved in conventional catabolic repression (crp, cya), 
cAMP-independent catabolite repression (creC, fruR, rpoS,) the stringent 
response (relA, spoT) and the global carbon storage regulator (csrA) did not 
prevent GRAIL. Although the basis of GRAIL remains uncertain, it is clear that 
the mechanism is distinct from conventional catabolite repression. Moreover, 
GRAIL is not due to inactivation of the enzymic activity of LuxS, since in E. 
coli, LuxS contained within stationary-phase cells grown in the absence of 
glucose maintains its activity in vitro.

exopolysaccharide synthesis, is regulated by RosR, phosphate, and the carbon 
source.

Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii pssA encodes a glucosyl-isoprenylphosphate 
(IP)-transferase involved in the first step of exopolysaccharide (EPS) 
synthesis. It was found that the pssA gene is an important target for regulation 
of this biosynthetic pathway. The data of this study indicate that pssA 
transcription is a very complex and mainly positively regulated process. A 
detailed analysis of a 767-bp-long pssA upstream region revealed the presence of 
several sequence motifs recognized by regulatory proteins that are associated 
with phosphate-, carbon-, and iron-dependent regulation. In addition, numerous 
inverted repeats of different lengths have been identified in this region. pssA 
transcription is directed from two distal P1 and proximal P3 promoters whose 
sequences demonstrate a significant identity to promoters recognized by RNA 
polymerase sigma factor σ(70). Among rhizobial proteins, RosR seems to be a 
primary regulator that positively affects pssA expression. This protein binds to 
RosR box 1 located downstream of the P1 promoter. In addition, phosphate and the 
carbon source strongly affect pssA transcription. A significantly lower level of 
pssA expression was observed in both the wild-type strain growing under 
phosphate-rich conditions and the phoB mutant. In this regulation, the PhoB 
protein and Pho box 2 located upstream of the P3 promoter were engaged. pssA 
transcription is also significantly affected by glucose. Transcriptional 
analysis of a set of pssA-lacZ fusions expressed in Escherichia coli wild-type 
and cyaA and crp mutants confirmed that cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) 
and two cAMP-CRP boxes located upstream of the P1 are required for this 
upregulation. Moreover, the production of EPS was totally abolished in R. 
leguminosarum bv. trifolii mutant strains 4440 and 1012 containing a Tn5 
insertion downstream of the P3 promoter and downstream of the P3 -35 hexamer, 
respectively.

The Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii RosR: transcriptional regulator 
involved in exopolysaccharide production.

The acidic exopolysaccharide is required for the establishment of symbiosis 
between the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii and 
clover. Here, we describe RosR protein from R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii 24.2, 
a homolog of transcriptional regulators belonging to the family of Ros/MucR 
proteins. R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii RosR possesses a characteristic Cys2His2 
type zinc-finger motif in its C-terminal domain. Recombinant (His)6RosR binds to 
an RosR-box sequence located up-stream of rosR. Deletion analysis of the rosR 
upstream region resulted in identification of two -35 to -10 promoter sequences, 
two conserved inverted palindromic pentamers that resemble the cAMP-CRP binding 
site of Escherichia coli, inverted repeats identified as a RosR binding site, 
and other regulatory sequence motifs. When assayed in E. coli, a transcriptional 
fusion of the cAMP-CRP binding site containing the rosR upstream region and lacZ 
gene was moderately responsive to glucose. The sensitivity of the rosR promoter 
to glucose was not observed in E. coli deltacyaA. A rosR frame-shift mutant of 
R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii formed dry, wrinkled colonies and induced nodules 
on clover, but did not fix nitrogen. In the rosR mutant, transcription of 
pssA-lacZ fusion was decreased, indicating positive regulation of the pssA gene 
by RosR. Multiple copies of rosR in R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii 24.2 increased 
exopolysaccharide production.

Multiple stress signal integration in the regulation of the complex sigma

The csiD-ygaF-gabDTP region in the Escherichia coli genome represents a cluster 
of sigma S-controlled genes. Here, we investigated promoter structures, sigma 
factor dependencies, potential co-regulation and environmental regulatory 
patterns for all of these genes. We find that this region constitutes a complex 
operon with expression being controlled by three differentially regulated 
promoters: (i) csiDp, which affects the expression of all five genes, is 
cAMP-CRP/sigma S-dependent and activated exclusively upon carbon starvation and 
stationary phase; (ii) gabDp1, which is sigma S-dependent and exhibits multiple 
stress induction like sigma S itself; and (iii) gabDp2[previously suggested by 
Schneider, B.L., Ruback, S., Kiupakis, A.K., Kasbarian, H., Pybus, C., and 
Reitzer, L. (2002) J. Bacteriol. 184: 6976-6986], which appears to be Nac/sigma 
70-controlled and to respond to poor nitrogen sources. In addition, we identify 
a novel repressor, CsiR, which modulates csiDp activity in a temporal manner 
during early stationary phase. Finally, we propose a physiological role for 
sigma S-controlled GabT/D-mediated gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) catabolism and 
glutamate accumulation in general stress adaptation. This physiological role is 
reflected by the activation of the operon-internal gabDp1 promoter under the 
different conditions that also induce sigma S, which include shifts to acidic pH 
or high osmolarity as well as starvation or stationary phase.

Role of activator site position and a distal UP-element half-site for sigma 
factor selectivity at a CRP/H-NS-activated sigma(s)-dependent promoter in 
Escherichia coli.

Transcription initiation by the stress-associated sigma(S)-containing RNA 
polymerase holoenzyme (E sigma(S)) in Escherichia coli is often subject to 
complex regulation that involves multiple additional regulators and histone-like 
proteins. csiD is a stationary phase-inducible sigma(S)-dependent gene in E. 
coli that requires activation by cAMP-CRP (bound to a site centred at -68.5 
nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site) and is positively 
modulated by the abundant nucleoid-associated proteins H-NS and Lrp. By shifting 
the CRP box to positions between -80.5 and -60.5, we could demonstrate that: (i) 
activation is equally helix phase dependent as at classic class I promoters; 
(ii) E sigma(S) prefers a CRP box location at -68.5/-70.5, whereas E sigma(70) 
is nearly inactive with such an arrangement; and (iii) with the CRP site moved 
to -60.5, transcription can be initiated efficiently by both holoenzymes. The 
csiD promoter region also contains a distal UP-element half-site located 
downstream of the CRP box, as demonstrated by mutational studies, in which this 
element was either eliminated or completed to a full UP-element. The UP-element 
half-site favours E sigma(S)-mediated expression, whereas with the full 
UP-element, nearly wild-type levels of csiD transcription were observed in the 
absence of sigma(S). Finally, we show that the two histone-like proteins, H-NS 
and Lrp, both act by influencing activation by cAMP-CRP, but do so by different 
mechanisms. In particular, H-NS directly or indirectly increases positional 
stringency for the CRP binding site. The implications of these findings with 
respect to sigma factor selectivity, activation mechanisms used by the two 
holoenzymes and the architecture of sigma(S)-dependent promoters are discussed.

Molecular analysis of the regulation of csiD, a carbon starvation-inducible gene 
in Escherichia coli that is exclusively dependent on sigma s and requires 
activation by cAMP-CRP.

The general stress-induced sigma subunit sigma s of Escherichia coli RNA 
polymerase is closely related to the vegetative sigma factor sigma 70. In view 
of their very similar promoter specificity in vitro, it is unclear how sigma 
factor selectivity in the expression of sigma s-dependent genes is generated in 
vivo. The csiD gene is such a strongly sigma s-dependent gene. In contrast to 
sigma s, which is induced in response to many different stresses, csiD, whose 
expression is driven from a single promoter, is induced by carbon starvation 
only. To our knowledge, the csiD promoter is the first characterized promoter 
which is not only exclusively dependent on sigma s-containing RNA polymerase (E 
sigma s), but also requires an activator, cAMP-CRP. In addition, 
leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) acts as a positive modulator of csiD 
expression. Also in vitro, E sigma s is more efficient than E sigma 70 in csiD 
promoter binding, open complex formation and run-off transcription, which might 
be due to the poor match of the csiD -35 region to the sigma 70 consensus and to 
transcription by E sigma s being less dependent on contacts in this region. By 
DNase I protection experiments, a cAMP-CRP binding site centered at -68.5 
nucleotides upstream of the csiD transcriptional start site was identified. 
While cAMP-CRP stimulates E sigma 70 binding, it does not promote open complex 
formation by E sigma 70, but does so in conjunction with E sigma s. With linear 
templates, cAMP-CRP significantly stimulates E sigma s-mediated in vitro 
transcription, whereas transcription by E sigma 70 is negligible and hardly 
stimulated by cAMP-CRP. These findings may reflect different or less stringent 
positional requirements for an activator site for E sigma s than for E sigma 70, 
and indicate that cAMP-CRP contributes to sigma factor selectivity at the csiD 
promoter. In vitro transcription experiments with super-coiled templates, 
however, revealed significant cAMP-CRP-stimulated transcription also by E sigma 
70. Yet, under these conditions, H-NS was found to restore E sigma s specificity 
by strongly interfering with cAMP-CRP/E sigma 70-dependent transcription. Lrp 
strongly and cooperatively binds to multiple sites located between positions -14 
and -102 (in a way that suggests DNA wrapping around multiple Lrp molecules) and 
moderately stimulates in vitro transcription, especially with E sigma s. In 
summary, we conclude that the csiD promoter has an intrinsic preference for E 
sigma s, but that also protein factors such as cAMP-CRP, Lrp and probably H-NS 
as well as DNA conformation contribute to its strong E sigma s selectivity. 
Furthermore, this strong E sigma s preference in combination with a requirement 
for high concentrations of the essential activator cAMP-CRP ensures csiD 
expression under conditions of carbon starvation, but not other stress 
conditions.

A variety of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, are known to enter the viable 
but non-culturable (VBNC) state under various stress conditions. During this 
state, cells lose colony-forming activities on conventional agar plates while 
retaining signs of viability. Diverse environmental stresses including 
starvation induce the VBNC state. However, little is known about the genetic 
mechanism inducing this state. Here, we aimed to reveal the genetic determinants 
of the VBNC state of E. coli. We hypothesized that the VBNC state is a process 
wherein specific gene products important for colony formation are depleted 
during the extended period of stress conditions. If so, higher expression of 
these genes would maintain colony-forming activities, thereby restraining cells 
from entering the VBNC state. From an E. coli plasmid-encoded ORF library, we 
identified genes that were responsible for maintaining high colony-forming 
activities after exposure to starvation condition. Among these, cpdA encoding 
cAMP phosphodiesterase exhibited higher performance in the maintenance of 
colony-forming activities. As cpdA overexpression decreases intracellular cAMP, 
cAMP or its complex with cAMP-receptor protein (CRP) may negatively regulate 
colony-forming activities under stress conditions. We confirmed this using 
deletion mutants lacking adenylate cyclase or CRP. These mutants fully 
maintained colony-forming activities even after a long period of starvation, 
while wild-type cells lost most of this activity. Thus, we concluded that the 
lack of cAMP-CRP effectively retains high colony-forming activities, indicating 
that cAMP-CRP acts as a positive regulator necessary for the induction of the 
VBNC state in E. coli.

Inhibition of bacterial growth under aerobic conditions by elevated levels of 
cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), first revealed more than 50 years 
ago, was attributed to accumulation of toxic methylglyoxal (MG). Here, we report 
a Crp-dependent mechanism rather than MG accumulation that accounts for the 
phenotype in Shewanella oneidensis, an emerging research model for the bacterial 
physiology. We show that a similar phenotype can be obtained by removing CpdA, a 
cAMP phosphodiesterase that appears more effective than its Escherichia coli 
counterpart. Although production of heme c and cytochromes c is correlated well 
with cAMP levels, neither is sufficient for the retarded growth. Quantities of 
overall cytochromes c increased substantially in the presence of elevated cAMP, 
a phenomenon resembling cells respiring on non-oxygen electron acceptors. In 
contrast, transcription of Crp-dependent genes encoding both cytochromes bd and 
cbb3 oxidases is substantially repressed under the same condition. Overall, our 
results suggest that cAMP of elevated levels drives cells into a low-energetic 
status, under which aerobic respiration is inhibited.

A cAMP-independent carbohydrate-driven mechanism inhibits tnaA expression and 
TnaA enzyme activity in Escherichia coli.

Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, USA.

When Escherichia coli is grown in a medium lacking glucose or another preferred 
carbohydrate, the concentration of cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (cAMP-CRP) 
increases, and this latter complex regulates the expression of more than 180 
genes. To respond rapidly to changes in carbohydrate availability, E. coli must 
maintain a suitable intracellular concentration of cAMP by either exporting or 
degrading excess cAMP. Currently, cAMP export via the TolC protein is thought to 
be more efficient at reducing these levels than is CpdA-mediated degradation of 
cAMP. Here, we compared the contributions of TolC and CpdA by measuring the 
expression of cAMP-regulated genes that encode tryptophanase (TnaA) and 
β-galactosidase. In the presence of exogenous cAMP, a tolC mutant produced 
intermediate levels of these enzymes, suggesting that cAMP levels were held in 
check by CpdA. Conversely, a cpdA mutant produced much higher amounts of these 
enzymes, indicating that CpdA was more efficient than TolC at reducing cAMP 
levels. Surprisingly, expression of the tnaA gene halted rapidly when glucose 
was added to cells lacking both TolC and CpdA, even though under these 
conditions cAMP could not be removed by either pathway and tnaA expression 
should have remained high. This result suggests the existence of an additional 
mechanism that eliminates intracellular cAMP or terminates expression of some 
cAMP-CRP-regulated genes. In addition, adding glucose and other carbohydrates 
rapidly inhibited the function of pre-formed TnaA, indicating that TnaA is 
regulated by a previously unknown carbohydrate-dependent post-translational 
mechanism.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting quorum signaling.

Indole production by Escherichia coli, discovered in the early 20th century, has 
been used as a diagnostic marker for distinguishing E. coli from other enteric 
bacteria. By using transcriptional profiling and competition studies with 
defined mutants, we show that cyclic AMP (cAMP)-regulated indole formation is a 
major factor that enables E. coli growth in mixed biofilm and planktonic 
populations with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mutants deficient in cAMP production 
(cyaA) or the cAMP receptor gene (crp), as well as indole production (tnaA), 
were not competitive in coculture with P. aeruginosa but could be restored to 
wild-type competitiveness by supplementation with a physiologically relevant 
indole concentration. E. coli sdiA mutants, which lacked the receptor for both 
indole and N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), showed no change in competitive 
fitness, suggesting that indole acted directly on P. aeruginosa. An E. coli tnaA 
mutant strain regained wild-type competiveness if grown with P. aeruginosa AHL 
synthase (rhlI and rhlI lasI) mutants. In contrast to the wild type, P. 
aeruginosa AHL synthase mutants were unable to degrade indole. Indole produced 
during mixed-culture growth inhibited pyocyanin production and other 
AHL-regulated virulence factors in P. aeruginosa. Mixed-culture growth with P. 
aeruginosa stimulated indole formation in E. coli cpdA, which is unable to 
regulate cAMP levels, suggesting the potential for mixed-culture gene activation 
via cAMP. These findings illustrate how indole, an early described feature of E. 
coli central metabolism, can play a significant role in mixed-culture survival 
by inhibiting quorum-regulated competition factors in P. aeruginosa.

In Escherichia coli more than 180 genes are regulated by the cyclic AMP 
(cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. However, more than 90% of cAMP that 
is made by intracellular adenylyl cyclases is found in the culture medium. How 
is cAMP exported from E. coli? In a tolC mutant, 0.03 mM IPTG 
(isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside) was sufficient to induce β-galactosidase 
compared to 0.1 mM IPTG in the parent strain. In a cya mutant unable to produce 
cAMP about 1 mM extracellular cAMP was required to induce β-galactosidase, 
whereas in a cya tolC mutant 0.1 mM cAMP was sufficient. When cAMP in E. coli 
cya was generated intracellularly by a recombinant, weakly active adenylyl 
cyclase from Corynebacterium glutamicum, the critical level of cAMP necessary 
for induction of maltose degradation was only achieved in a tolC mutant and not 
in the parent strain. Deletion of a putative cAMP phosphodiesterase of E. coli, 
CpdA, resulted in a slightly similar, yet more diffuse phenotype. The data 
demonstrate that export of cAMP via TolC is a most efficient way of E. coli to 
lower high concentrations of cAMP in the cell and maintain its sensitivity in 
changing metabolic environments.

Many Serratia marcescens strains produce the red pigment prodigiosin, which has 
antimicrobial and anti-tumor properties. Previous reports suggest that cyclic 
AMP (cAMP) is a positive regulator of prodigiosin production. Supporting this 
model, the addition of glucose to growth medium inhibited pigment production in 
rich and minimal media. Unexpectedly, we observed highly elevated levels of 
prodigiosin production in isogenic strains with mutations in genes involved in 
cAMP production (cyaA and crr) and in cAMP-dependent transcriptional signaling 
(crp). Multicopy expression of the Escherichia coli cAMP-phosphodiesterase gene, 
cpdA, also conferred a striking increase in prodigiosin production. Exogenous 
cAMP decreased both pigment production and pigA-lacZ transcription in the 
wild-type (WT) strain, and pigA-lacZ transcription was significantly increased 
in a crp mutant relative to WT. Suppressor and epistasis analysis indicate that 
the hyperpigment phenotype was dependent upon pigment biosynthetic genes (pigA, 
pigB, pigC, pigD and pigM). These experiments establish cAMP as a negative 
regulator of prodigiosin production in S. marcescens.

Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the active ingredient of household bleach, functions 
as a powerful antimicrobial that is used not only in numerous industrial 
applications but also in mammalian host defence. Here we show that multicopy 
expression of cpdA, encoding the cAMP phosphodiesterase, leads to a dramatically 
increased resistance of Escherichia coli to HOCl stress as well as to the 
unrelated hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) stress. This general oxidative stress 
resistance is apparently caused by the CpdA-mediated decrease in cellular cAMP 
levels, which leads to the partial inactivation of the global transcriptional 
regulator cAMP receptor protein (CRP). Downregulation of CRP in turn causes the 
derepression of rpoS, encoding the alternative sigma factor sigma(S), which 
activates the general stress response in E. coli. We found that these highly 
oxidative stress-resistant cells have a substantially increased capacity to 
combat HOCl-mediated insults and to degrade reactive oxygen species. Mutational 
analysis revealed that the DNA-protecting protein Dps, the catalase KatE, and 
the exonuclease III XthA play the predominant roles in conferring the high 
resistance of rpoS-overexpressing strains towards HOCl and H(2)O(2) stress. Our 
results demonstrate the close regulatory interplay between cellular cAMP levels, 
sigma(S) activity and oxidative stress resistance in E. coli.

Genetic regulation of glycogen biosynthesis in Escherichia coli: in vitro 
effects of cyclic AMP and guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate and analysis 
of in vivo transcripts.

Glycogen accumulation in Escherichia coli is inversely related to the growth 
rate and occurs most actively when cells enter the stationary phase. The levels 
of the three biosynthetic enzymes undergo corresponding changes under these 
conditions, suggesting that genetic control of enzyme biosynthesis may account 
for at least part of the regulation (J. Preiss, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 
38:419-458, 1984). We have begun to explore the molecular basis of this control 
by identifying factors which affect the expression of the glycogen genes and by 
determining the 5'-flanking regions required to mediate the regulatory effects. 
The in vitro coupled transcription-translation of two of the biosynthetic genes, 
glgC (ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase) and glgA (glycogen synthase), was enhanced 
up to 26- and 10-fold, respectively, by cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP receptor 
protein (CRP). Guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate stimulated the expression 
of these genes 3.6- and 1.8-fold, respectively. The expression of glgB (glycogen 
branching enzyme) was affected weakly or negligibly by the above-mentioned 
compounds. Assays which measured the in vitro formation of the first dipeptide 
of glgC showed that a restriction fragment which contained 0.5 kilobases of DNA 
upstream from the initiation codon supported cAMP-CRP-activated expression. 
Sequence-specific binding of cAMP-CRP to a 243-base-pair restriction fragment 
from the region upstream from glgC was observed by virtue of the altered 
electrophoretic mobility of the bound DNA. S1 nuclease protection analysis 
identified 5' termini of four in vivo transcripts within 0.5 kilobases of the 
glgC coding region. The relative concentrations of transcripts were higher in 
the early stationary phase than in the exponential phase. Two mutants which 
overproduced the biosynthesis enzymes accumulated elevated levels of specific 
transcripts. The 5' termini of three of the transcripts were mapped to a high 
resolution. Their upstream sequences showed weak similarity to the E. coli 
consensus promoter. These results suggest complex transcriptional regulation of 
the glycogen biosynthesis genes involving multiple promoter sites and direct 
control of gene expression by at least two global regulatory systems.

[Antibacterial effects of silver ions: effect on gram-negative bacteria growth 
and biofilm formation].

[Article in Russian]

Radtsig MA, Koksharova OA, Khmel' IA.

Minimal inhibiting AgNO3 concentration (MICs) in the gram-negative bacteria 
Escherichia coli K12, Serratia proteamaculans 94, and Serratia liquefaciens MG1 
were found to be on the average within the range of 0.075-0.3 microg/ml, and for 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and P. chlororaphis 449, 0.15-0.3 microg/ml. Biofilm 
formation in Escherichia coli AB1157 and S. Proteamaculans 94 was completely 
inhibited at an AgNO3 concentration of 0.3 microg/ml, and in Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa PAO1, at 0.6 microg/mlAgNO3. Mutations in E. coli genes encoding for 
global regulators of gene expression, such as sigma S and sigma N subunits of 
RNA polymerase, catabolite repression protein CRP, and Lon protease, had no 
marked effect on the sensitivity of cells to silver. The wild-type E. coli 
strains and strains deficient in excision repair (uvrA, uvrB), SOS-repair or 
recombination (recA, lexA, recBC, recF mutants) did not differ in their silver 
sensitivity. This suggests that the sensitivity of bacteria to silver does not 
correlate with DNA lesions that could be repaired by these repair and 
recombination systems. E. coli mutant strains deficient in porins OmpF or OmpC, 
were 3-4-fold more resistant to silver ions as compared with the wild-type 
strain. Experiments with pME6863 plasmid harboring the gene of N-acyl-homoserine 
lactonase AiiA demonstrated that Quorum Sensing regulation (QS) did not 
participate in the control of S. proteamaculans 94 and P. chlororaphis 449 
silver sensitivity. The same conclusion was drawn from the comparison of AgNO3 
MICs for the S. liquefaciens wild-type strain and a mutant strain deficient in 
QS.

Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins play essential roles in many fundamental 
biological events such as DNA replication, recombination, and transcription. One 
common feature of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins is to introduce 
structural changes to their DNA recognition sites including DNA-bending and DNA 
linking number change (ΔLk). In this article, I review recent progress in 
studying protein-induced ΔLk by several sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, 
such as E. coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and lactose repressor (LacI). It was 
demonstrated recently that protein-induced ΔLk is an intrinsic property for 
sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins and does not correlate to protein-induced 
other structural changes, such as DNA bending. For instance, although CRP bends 
its DNA recognition site by 90°, it was not able to introduce a ΔLk to it. 
However, LacI was able to simultaneously bend and introduce a ΔLk to its DNA 
binding sites. Intriguingly, LacI also constrained superhelicity within LacI-lac 
O1 complexes if (-) supercoiled DNA templates were provided. I also discuss how 
protein-induced ΔLk help sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins regulate their 
biological functions. For example, it was shown recently that LacI utilizes the 
constrained superhelicity (ΔLk) in LacI-lac O1 complexes and serves as a 
topological barrier to constrain free, unconstrained (-) supercoils within the 
401-bp DNA loop. These constrained (-) supercoils enhance LacI's binding 
affinity and therefore the repression of the lac promoter. Other biological 
functions include how DNA replication initiators λ O and DnaA use the induced 
ΔLk to open/melt bacterial DNA replication origins.

Downregulation of the Escherichia coli guaB promoter by upstream-bound cyclic 
AMP receptor protein.

Husnain SI(1), Busby SJ, Thomas MS.

Author information:
(1)School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Sheffield, 
Sheffield, United Kingdom.

The Escherichia coli guaB promoter (P(guaB)) is responsible for directing 
transcription of the guaB and guaA genes, which specify the biosynthesis of the 
nucleotide GMP. P(guaB) is subject to growth rate-dependent control (GRDC) and 
possesses an UP element that is required for this regulation. In addition, 
P(guaB) contains a discriminator, three binding sites for the 
nucleoid-associated protein FIS, and putative binding sites for the regulatory 
proteins DnaA, PurR, and cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP). Here we show that 
the CRP-cyclic AMP (cAMP) complex binds to a site located over 100 bp upstream 
of the guaB transcription start site, where it serves to downregulate P(guaB). 
The CRP-mediated repression of P(guaB) activity increases in media that support 
lower growth rates. Inactivation of the crp or cyaA gene or 
ablation/translocation of the CRP site relieves repression by CRP and results in 
a loss of GRDC of P(guaB). Thus, GRDC of P(guaB) involves a progressive increase 
in CRP-mediated repression of the promoter as the growth rate decreases. Our 
results also suggest that the CRP-cAMP complex does not direct GRDC at P(guaB) 
and that at least one other regulatory factor is required for conferring GRDC on 
this promoter. However, PurR and DnaA are not required for this regulatory 
mechanism.

Regulation of the divergent guaBA and xseA promoters of Escherichia coli by the 
cyclic AMP receptor protein.

Sciences, University of Southampton, Biomedical Sciences Building, Bassett 
Crescent East, SO16 7PX, Southampton, UK.

The gua promoter (guaP) of Escherichia coli resembles those for ribosomal RNA 
(rrn) operons and lies in a close back-to-back arrangement with the promoter for 
xseA (xseP). Transcription from guaP is subject to stringent control and 
growth-rate-dependent regulation, and to repression by DnaA and PurR. In 
addition, transcription from guaP is regulated by the cyclic AMP receptor 
protein (CRP). Plasmid-borne promoter fusions to the receptor gene for 
chloramphenicol acetyl transferase were used to assess the role of CRP in 
controlling transcription from guaP and xseP following a downshift of cultures 
from rich into minimal medium. CRP is required to activate guaBA transcription 
and repress xseA transcription following downshift. Bandshift assays with a DNA 
fragment carrying the divergent promoters revealed specific binding of CRP. We 
propose that CRP, binding to a near-consensus site centred at -117.5, activates 
transcription from guaP and obstructs transcription from the xseA promoter.

Transcription of rpoH, encoding the Escherichia coli heat-shock regulator 
sigma32, is negatively controlled by the cAMP-CRP/CytR nucleoprotein complex.

Comment in
    Mol Microbiol. 1999 Jan;31(1):393.

In Escherichia coli, the rpoH gene encoding the essential heat-shock regulator 
sigma32, is expressed in a complex manner. Transcription occurs from four 
promoters (P1, P3, P4 and P5) and is modulated by several factors including (i) 
two sigma factors (sigma70 and sigmaE); (ii) the global regulator CRP; and (iii) 
the DnaA protein. Here, a further dissection of the rpoH regulatory region has 
revealed that an additional transcription control exists that appears to link 
rpoH expression to nucleoside metabolism. The cAMP-CRP complex and the CytR 
anti-activator bind co-operatively to the promoter region forming a repression 
complex that overlaps the sigmaE-dependent P3 promoter and the sigma70-dependent 
P4 and P5 promoters. During steady-state growth conditions with glycerol as the 
carbon and energy source, transcription from P3, P4 and P5 is reduced 
approximately threefold by CytR, whereas transcription from the upstream 
promoter, P1, appears to be unaffected. Furthermore, in strains that slightly 
overproduce CytR, transcription from P3, P4 and P5 is reduced even further 
(approximately 10-fold), and repression can be fully neutralized by the addition 
of the inducer cytidine to the growth medium. In the induced state, P4 is the 
strongest promoter and, together with P3 and P5, it is responsible for most rpoH 
transcription (65-70%). At present, CytR has been shown to 'fine tune' 
transcription of two genes (rpoH and ppiA) that are connected with 
protein-folding activities. These findings suggest that additional assistance in 
protein folding is required under conditions in which CytR is induced (i.e. in 
the presence of nucleosides).

Stringent and growth-rate-dependent control of the gua operon of Escherichia 
coli K-12.

The promoter of the gua operon has been located by transcript mapping using 
primer extension with reverse transcriptase. The surrounding nucleotide sequence 
has features characteristic of promoters under stringent and 
growth-rate-dependent regulation, namely a GC-rich discriminator next to the -10 
hexamer, an upstream AT-rich sequence (the UP element) and potential FIS-binding 
sites. Transcriptional activity of the gua promoter was examined using 
transcriptional fusions to lacZ placed at a single chromosomal location. 
Expression from gua was reduced under stringent conditions in vivo, and varied 
with growth rate. Growth-rate control was independent of guanine-mediated 
repression. A fusion in which the GC-rich discriminator was mutated by insertion 
of an AT-rich oligonucleotide was used to demonstrate the importance of this 
region in control. Both stringent and growth-rate-dependent controls were 
abolished by the mutation. Other potential regulatory signals in the vicinity of 
the gua promoter are a pur operator (binding site for the PurR repressor), a gua 
operator, a DnaA-binding site and a CRP/FNR-binding sequence. The gua promoter 
lies back-to-back with the promoter for xseA (exonuclease VII), the two 
promoters being separated by only 20 bp.

In the absence of sugars, C4-dicarboxylates (C4DC) like fumarate represent 
important substrates for growth of Escherichia coli. Aerobically, C4DCs are 
oxidized to CO2 whereas anaerobically, C4DCs are used for fumarate respiration. 
In order to determine the impact of fumarate under aerobic and anaerobic 
conditions, proteomes of E. coli W3110 grown aerobically or anaerobically with 
fumarate and/or the non-C4DC substrate glycerol were comparatively profiled by 
nanoLC-MS/MS. Membrane enrichment allowed sensitive detection of membrane 
proteins. A total of 1657 proteins of which 646 and 374 were assigned to the 
cytosol or membrane, respectively, were covered. Presence of fumarate triggered 
changes (≥ 2fold) to the levels of 211 and 76 proteins under aerobic and 
anaerobic growth, respectively. The fumarate induced changes included proteins 
encoded by genes regulated by the C4DC two-component system DcuS-DcuR (DctA, 
DcuB, FumB, FrdABC proteins) catalyzing uptake and initial catabolic steps. Many 
of the proteins displaying altered levels are not part of the DcuS-DcuR regulon, 
including proteins of citric acid cycle and associated pathways (aerobic), 
proteins involved in motility and chemotaxis (anaerobic), and oxidative stress. 
Their genes are mostly preceded by cAMP receptor protein (CRP) sites, some by 
DcuR-like sites. Testing of selected genes confirmed regulation by CRP and 
DcuS-DcuR. SIGNIFICANCE: Global protein profiling of the soluble and the 
membrane fraction provides a comprehensive view on the protein pattern of E. 
coli grown aerobically and anaerobically with or without fumarate. The results 
disclose during aerobic growth besides the known impact of the C4-dicarboxylates 
(C4DC) on carbon utilization and citric acid cycle major adaptations in amino 
acid metabolism. In contrast, protein alterations in the presence of fumarate 
under anaerobic conditions point to enhanced motility and chemotaxis. Only 
proteins (transporters, initial metabolic steps) feeding external C4DCs to the 
central pathways were regulated by the C4DC two-component system DcuS-DcuR, 
whereas other protein levels were controlled in an indirect manner by CRP 
triggered catabolite control and other mechanisms. Consequently, metabolic and 
transcriptional regulation by C4DCs is apparently effected by a network of the 
DcuS-DcuR system with important contribution by catabolite control.

RpoS-independent and growth phase-dependent expression of dcuSR operon of 
Escherichia coli.

The dcuSR operon of Escherichia coli encodes a two-component 
sensor/kinase-response/regulator system. This system regulates gene expression 
in response to external C 4 -dicarboxylates. During entry into stationary phase 
Gram-negative bacteria express genes that impart cellular resistance to 
environmental stresses. In E. coli , 50 or more genes are triggered by sigma 
factor ( sigma s ) during entry into stationary phase. Multi-copy dcuS-lacZ and 
chromosomally integrated dcuS-lacZ fusions analysis showed that the expression 
of dcuSR is positively regulated during growth phase. Many genes that are 
required for stationary-phase adaptation are controlled by RpoS, a conserved 
alternative sigma factor, whose expression is, in turn, controlled by many 
factors. To understand whether the dcuSR is dependent upon RpoS, a RpoS- 
dcuS-lacZ strain was generated. beta -Galactosidase assay and Western blot 
analysis reported that the generated RpoS- dcuS-lacZ strain and the wild type 
showed the same expression during stationary phase. Surprisingly, the growth 
phase-dependence of the expression of dcuSR is still present in RpoS- dcuS-lacZ 
strain suggesting that other growth-phase-dependent regulatory mechanisms (might 
be the DcuSR system or cAMP/CRP), in addition to RpoS, may control 
post-exponential dcuSR expression.

The DcuS-R two-component system of Escherichia coli senses C4-dicarboxylates of 
the medium and regulates expression of the genes related to utilization of them. 
It is known that phospho-DcuR induces expression of genes such as the dcuB-fumB 
operon, the frdABCD operon, and the dctA gene. We analyzed promoters of the 
dcuS-R operon to elucidate the transcriptional regulation system. We found a 
novel internal promoter within the dcuS gene that is regulated by the 
transcriptional regulator, CRP-cAMP, in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

Inactivation and regulation of the aerobic C(4)-dicarboxylate transport (dctA) 
gene of Escherichia coli.

The gene (dctA) encoding the aerobic C(4)-dicarboxylate transporter (DctA) of 
Escherichia coli was previously mapped to the 79-min region of the linkage map. 
The nucleotide sequence of this region reveals two candidates for the dctA gene: 
f428 at 79.3 min and the o157a-o424-o328 (or orfQMP) operon at 79.9 min. The 
f428 gene encodes a homologue of the Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium 
leguminosarum H(+)/C(4)-dicarboxylate symporter, DctA, whereas the orfQMP operon 
encodes homologues of the aerobic periplasmic-binding protein- dependent 
C(4)-dicarboxylate transport system (DctQ, DctM, and DctP) of Rhodobacter 
capsulatus. To determine which, if either, of these loci specify the E. coli 
DctA system, the chromosomal f428 and orfM genes were inactivated by inserting 
Sp(r) or Ap(r) cassettes, respectively. The resulting f428 mutant was unable to 
grow aerobically with fumarate or malate as the sole carbon source and grew 
poorly with succinate. Furthermore, fumarate uptake was abolished in the f428 
mutant and succinate transport was approximately 10-fold lower than that of the 
wild type. The growth and fumarate transport deficiencies of the f428 mutant 
were complemented by transformation with an f428-containing plasmid. No growth 
defect was found for the orfM mutant. In combination, the above findings confirm 
that f428 corresponds to the dctA gene and indicate that the orfQMP products 
play no role in C(4)-dicarboxylate transport. Regulation studies with a 
dctA-lacZ (f428-lacZ) transcriptional fusion showed that dctA is subject to 
cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP)-dependent catabolite repression and 
ArcA-mediated anaerobic repression and is weakly induced by the DcuS-DcuR system 
in response to C(4)-dicarboxylates and citrate. Interestingly, in a dctA mutant, 
expression of dctA is constitutive with respect to C(4)-dicarboxylate induction, 
suggesting that DctA regulates its own synthesis. Northern blot analysis 
revealed a single, monocistronic dctA transcript and confirmed that dctA is 
subject to regulation by catabolite repression and CRP. Reverse 
transcriptase-mediated primer extension indicated a single transcriptional start 
site centered 81 bp downstream of a strongly predicted CRP-binding site.

Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli use the inner membrane transporter DctA 
to import the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway intermediate orotate from the 
environment. To study the regulation of dctA expression, we used an S. enterica 
serovar Typhimurium pyrimidine auxotroph to select a mutant that could grow in 
an otherwise nonpermissive culture medium containing glucose and a low 
concentration of orotate. Whole genome sequencing revealed a point mutation 
upstream of dctA in the putative cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) binding site. 
The C→T transition converted the least favourable base to the most favourable 
base for CRP-DNA affinity. A dctA::lux transcriptional fusion confirmed that the 
mutant dctA promoter gained responsiveness to CRP even in the presence of 
glucose. Moreover, dctA expression was higher in the mutant than the wild type 
in the presence of alternative carbon sources that activate CRP.

Nucleotide sequence encoding the flavoprotein and hydrophobic subunits of the 
succinate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli.

Wood D, Darlison MG, Wilde RJ, Guest JR.

The nucleotide sequence of a 3614 base-pair segment of DNA containing the sdhA 
gene, encoding the flavoprotein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase of 
Escherichia coli, and two genes sdhC and sdhD, encoding small hydrophobic 
subunits, has been determined. Together with the iron-sulphur protein gene 
(sdhB) these genes form an operon (sdhCDAB) situated between the citrate 
synthase gene (gltA) and the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex genes (sucAB): 
gltA-sdhCDAB-sucAB. Transcription of the gltA and sdhCDAB gene appears to 
diverge from a single intergenic region that contains two pairs of potential 
promoter sequences and two putative CRP (cyclic AMP receptor protein)-binding 
sites. The sdhA structural gene comprises 1761 base-pairs (587 codons, excluding 
the initiation codon, AUG) and it encodes a polypeptide of Mr 64268 that is 
strikingly homologous with the flavoprotein subunit of fumarate reductase (frdA 
gene product). The FAD-binding region, including the histidine residue at the 
FAD-attachment site, has been identified by its homology with other 
flavoproteins and with the flavopeptide of the bovine heart mitochondrial 
succinate dehydrogenase. Potential active-site cysteine and histidine residues 
have also been indicated by the comparisons. The sdhC (384 base-pairs) and sdhD 
(342 base-pairs) structural genes encode two strongly hydrophobic proteins of Mr 
14167 and 12792 respectively. These proteins resemble in size and composition, 
but not sequence, the membrane anchor proteins of fumarate reductase (the frdC 
and frdD gene products).

Transcription factor NNR from Paracoccus denitrificans is a sensor of both 
nitric oxide and oxygen: isolation of nnr* alleles encoding effector-independent 
proteins and evidence for a haem-based sensing mechanism.

The nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase regulator (NNR) from Paracoccus 
denitrificans activates transcription in response to nitric oxide (NO). The 
mechanism of NO sensing has not been elucidated for NNR, or for any of its 
orthologues from the FNR/CRP family of transcriptional regulators. Using 
regulated expression of the nnr gene in Escherichia coli, evidence has now been 
obtained to indicate that activation of NNR by NO does not require de novo 
synthesis of the NNR polypeptide. In anaerobic cultures, NNR is inactivated 
slowly following removal of the source of NO. In contrast, exposure of 
anaerobically grown cultures to oxygen causes rapid inactivation of NNR, 
suggesting that the protein is inactivated directly by oxygen. By random and 
site-directed mutagenesis, two variants of NNR were isolated (with substitutions 
of arginine at position 80) that show high levels of activity in anaerobic 
cultures in the absence of NO. These proteins remain substantially inactive in 
aerobic cultures, suggesting that the substitutions uncouple the NO- and 
oxygen-signalling mechanisms, thus providing further evidence that NNR senses 
both molecules. Structural modelling suggested that Arg-80 is close to the 
C-helix that forms the monomer-monomer interface in other members of the FNR/CRP 
family and plays an important role in transducing the activating signal between 
the regulatory and DNA binding domains. Assays of NNR activity in a 
haem-deficient mutant of E. coli provided preliminary evidence to indicate that 
NNR activity is haem dependent.

The two-component system BaeSR participates in antibiotics resistance of 
Escherichia coli. To know whether the outer membrane proteins involve in the 
antibiotics resistance mediated by BaeSR, deletion of acrB was constructed and 
the recombined plasmid p-baeR was introduced into E. coli K12 and K12△acrB. 
Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents were determined 
by 2-fold broth micro-dilution method. Gene expressions related with major outer 
membrane proteins and multidrug efflux pump-related genes were determined by 
real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The 
results revealed that the MICs of K12ΔacrB to the tested drugs except for 
gentamycin and amikacin decreased 2- to 16.75-folds compared with those of K12. 
When BaeR was overexpressed, the MICs of K12ΔacrB/p-baeR to ceftiofur and 
cefotaxime increased 2.5- and 2-fold, respectively, compared with their 
corresponding that of K12△acrB. At the same time, the expression levels of ompC, 
ompF, ompW, ompA and ompX showed significant reduction in K12ΔacrB/p-baeR as 
compared with K12△acrB. Moreover, the expression levels of ompR, marA, rob and 
tolC also significantly 'decreased' in K12ΔacrB/p-baeR. These findings indicated 
that BaeR overproduction can decrease cephalosporins susceptibility in acrB-free 
E. coli by decreasing the expression level of outer membrane proteins.

OBJECTIVES: In Escherichia coli, there are 32 open reading frames assumed, on 
the basis of sequence similarities, to be response regulator genes of 
two-component signal transduction systems. We cloned all 32 response regulators 
and examined whether or not response regulator-overexpressing cells confer 
resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in E. coli.
METHODS: E. coli KAM3 (acrB), a drug-hypersusceptible mutant, was used as a host 
strain for the overproduction of response regulators. MICs were determined by 
the agar dilution method.
RESULTS: Thirteen response regulators out of 32 genes, namely baeR, cheY, cpxR, 
creB, evgA, fimZ, narL, ompR, rcsB, rstA, yedW, yehT and dcuR, conferred 
increased beta-lactam resistance. Among them, overexpression of baeR, evgA, rcsB 
and dcuR conferred high-level resistance. The baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance 
is due to up-regulation of the expression of multidrug exporter genes, acrD and 
mdtABC for baeR, and yhiUV for evgA, because baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance 
was completely absent in strains lacking these exporter genes. The fimZ-mediated 
cefalothin resistance is due to the chromosomal ampC gene, because the ampC 
deletion strain did not show fimZ-mediated resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-component signal transduction systems contribute to beta-lactam 
resistance in E. coli. Multidrug exporters play roles in two-component signal 
transduction system-mediated beta-lactam resistance.

creB, evgA, fimZ, narL, ompR, rcsB, rstA, yedW, yehT and dcuR, conferred 
increased beta-lactam resistance. Among them, overexpression of baeR, evgA, rcsB 
and dcuR conferred high-level resistance. The baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance 
is due to up-regulation of the expression of multidrug exporter genes, acrD and 
mdtABC for baeR, and yhiUV for evgA, because baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance 
was completely absent in strains lacking these exporter genes. The fimZ-mediated 
cefalothin resistance is due to the chromosomal ampC gene, because the ampC 
deletion strain did not show fimZ-mediated resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-component signal transduction systems contribute to beta-lactam 
resistance in E. coli. Multidrug exporters play roles in two-component signal 
transduction system-mediated beta-lactam resistance.

Identification of Multiple Low-Level Resistance Determinants and Coselection of 
Motility Impairment upon Sub-MIC Ceftriaxone Exposure in Escherichia coli.

Massachusetts, USA.

Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins among Gram-negative bacteria is a 
rapidly growing public health threat. Among the most commonly used 
third-generation cephalosporins is ceftriaxone. Bacterial exposure to sublethal 
or sub-MIC antibiotic concentrations occurs widely, from environmental residues 
to intermittently at the site of infection. Quality of ceftriaxone is also a 
concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries, with medicines having 
inappropriate active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content or concentration. 
While focus has been largely on extended-spectrum β-lactamases and high-level 
resistance, there are limited data on specific chromosomal mutations and other 
pathways that contribute to ceftriaxone resistance under these conditions. In 
this work, Escherichia coli cells were exposed to a broad range of sub-MICs of 
ceftriaxone and mutants were analyzed using whole-genome sequencing. Low-level 
ceftriaxone resistance emerged after as low as 10% MIC exposure, with the 
frequency of resistance development increasing with concentration. Genomic 
analyses of mutants revealed multiple genetic bases. Mutations were enriched in 
genes associated with porins (envZ, ompF, ompC, and ompR), efflux regulation 
(marR), and the outer membrane and metabolism (galU and pgm), but none were 
associated with the ampC β-lactamase. We also observed selection of mgrB 
mutations. Notably, pleiotropic effects on motility and cell surface were 
selected for in multiple independent genes, which may have important 
consequences. Swift low-level resistance development after exposure to low 
ceftriaxone concentrations may result in reservoirs of bacteria with relevant 
mutations for survival and increased resistance. Thus, initiatives for broader 
surveillance of low-level antibiotic resistance and genomic resistance 
determinants should be pursued when resources are available. IMPORTANCE 
Ceftriaxone is a widely consumed antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. 
Bacteria, however, are increasingly becoming resistant to ceftriaxone. Most work 
has focused on known mechanisms associated with high-level ceftriaxone 
resistance. However, bacteria are extensively exposed to low antibiotic 
concentrations, and there are limited data on the evolution of ceftriaxone 
resistance under these conditions. In this work, we observed that bacteria 
quickly developed low-level resistance due to both novel and previously 
described mutations in multiple different genes upon exposure to low ceftriaxone 
concentrations. Additionally, exposure also led to changes in motility and the 
cell surface, which can impact other processes associated with resistance and 
infection. Notably, low-level-resistant bacteria would be missed in the clinic, 
which uses set breakpoints. While they may require increased resources, this 
work supports continued initiatives for broader surveillance of low-level 
antibiotic resistance or their resistance determinants, which can serve as 
predictors of higher risk for clinical resistance.

Two new members of the OmpR superfamily detected by homology to a sensor-binding 
core domain.

The OmpR superfamily includes proteins that act as transcriptional regulators of 
operons that respond to environmental stimuli. A homologous domain near the 
N-terminus, termed a sensor-binding core domain, is thought to play a role in 
recognition of a signal transduction protein. We have identified two previously 
unrecognized members of this regulator family of proteins: a 23.8-kd protein 
transcribed from the uvrC transcription unit and the PgtA gene product, which is 
a phosphoglycerate transport regulatory protein. The sensor-binding core domain 
is also present in four proteins that regulate bacterial sporulation and 
chemotaxis. The 23.8-kd protein also has sequence similarity to elongation 
factor Tu and two regulatory proteins: HtpR, the heat-shock regulatory protein, 
and TraJ, a regulator of expression of genes involved in conjugation. There is a 
77-amino acid region near the C-terminus of the 23.8-kd protein that has 30% 
similarity with a 28.1-kd protein coded for by an open reading frame 5' to the 
reading frame of the 23.8-kd protein in the uvrC transcription unit. Genetic 
distance analysis of amino acid sequences of proteins with a sensor-binding core 
domain suggests that the 23.8-kd protein and the chemotaxis regulatory proteins 
are distantly related to the other regulatory proteins in the OmpR superfamily.

Escherichia coli K-12.

Science and Technology, Ikoma 630-0101, Japan.

We have systematically examined the mRNA profiles of 36 two-component deletion 
mutants, which include all two-component regulatory systems of Escherichia coli, 
under a single growth condition. DNA microarray results revealed that the 
mutants belong to one of three groups based on their gene expression profiles in 
Luria-Bertani broth under aerobic conditions: (i) those with no or little 
change; (ii) those with significant changes; and (iii) those with drastic 
changes. Under these conditions, the anaeroresponsive ArcB/ArcA system, the 
osmoresponsive EnvZ/OmpR system and the response regulator UvrY showed the most 
drastic changes. Cellular functions such as flagellar synthesis and expression 
of the RpoS regulon were affected by multiple two-component systems. A high 
correlation coefficient of expression profile was found between several 
two-component mutants. Together, these results support the view that a network 
of functional interactions, such as cross-regulation, exists between different 
two-component systems. The compiled data are avail-able at our website 
(http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/xp_analysis/ 2_components).

OmpC-Dependent Bile Tolerance Contributes to E. coli Colonization of the 
Mammalian Intestine.

Doranga S(1), Conway T(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Oklahoma State University, 
Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA.

Escherichia coli persistently colonizes the mammalian intestine by mechanisms 
that are not fully understood. Previously, we found when streptomycin-treated 
mice were fed E. coli MG1655, the intestine selected for envZ missense mutants 
that outcompeted the wild type. The better-colonizing envZ mutants had a higher 
level of OmpC and reduced OmpF. This suggested the EnvZ/OmpR two-component 
system and outer membrane proteins play a role in colonization. In this study, 
we show that wild-type E. coli MG1655 outcompetes an envZ-ompR knockout mutant. 
Moreover, ompA and ompC knockout mutants are outcompeted by the wild type, while 
an ompF knockout mutant colonizes better than the wild type. Outer membrane 
protein gels show the ompF mutant overproduces OmpC. An ompC mutant is more 
sensitive to bile salts than the wild type and ompF mutant. The ompC mutant 
initiates colonization slowly because it is sensitive to physiological 
concentrations of bile salts in the intestine. Overexpression of ompC under the 
control of a constitutive promoter confers a colonization advantage only when 
ompF is deleted. These results indicate that fine-tuning of OmpC and OmpF levels 
is needed to maximize competitive fitness in the intestine. RNA sequencing 
reveals the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system is active in the intestine: ompC is 
upregulated and ompF is downregulated. While other factors could also contribute 
to the advantage provided by OmpC, we provide evidence that OmpC is important 
for E. coli to colonize the intestine because its smaller pore size excludes 
bile salts or other unknown toxic substances, while OmpF is deleterious because 
its larger pore size allows bile salts or other unknown toxic substances to 
enter the periplasm. IMPORTANCE Every mammalian intestine is colonized with 
Escherichia coli. Although E. coli is one of the most studied model organisms, 
how it colonizes the intestine is not fully understood. Here, we investigated 
the role of the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system and outer membrane proteins in 
colonization of the mouse intestine by E. coli. We report that an ompC mutant is 
a poor colonizer, while an ompF mutant, which overproduces OmpC, outcompetes the 
wild type. OmpF has a larger pore size that allows toxic bile salts or other 
toxic compounds into the cell and is deleterious for colonization of the 
intestine. OmpC has a smaller pore size and excludes bile salts. Our findings 
provide insights into why E. coli fine-tunes the levels of OmpC and OmpF during 
colonization via the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system.

Curli fimbriae are amyloids-found in bacteria (Escherichia coli)-that are 
involved in solid-surface adhesion and bacterial aggregation during biofilm 
formation. The curli protein CsgA is coded by a csgBAC operon gene, and the 
transcription factor CsgD is essential to induce its curli protein expression. 
However, the complete mechanism underlying curli fimbriae formation requires 
elucidation. Herein, we noted that curli fimbriae formation was inhibited by 
yccT-i.e., a gene that encodes a periplasmic protein of unknown function 
regulated by CsgD. Furthermore, curli fimbriae formation was strongly repressed 
by CsgD overexpression caused by a multicopy plasmid in BW25113-the 
non-cellulose-producing strain. YccT deficiency prevented these CsgD effects. 
YccT overexpression led to intracellular YccT accumulation and reduced CsgA 
expression. These effects were addressed by deleting the N-terminal signal 
peptide of YccT. Localization, gene expression, and phenotypic analyses revealed 
that YccT-dependent inhibition of curli fimbriae formation and curli protein 
expression was mediated by the two-component regulatory system EnvZ/OmpR. 
Purified YccT inhibited CsgA polymerization; however, no intracytoplasmic 
interaction between YccT and CsgA was detected. Thus, YccT-renamed CsgI (curli 
synthesis inhibitor)-is a novel inhibitor of curli fimbriae formation and has a 
dual role as an OmpR phosphorylation modulator and CsgA polymerization 
inhibitor.

Acidithiobacillus spp. are prevalent in acid mine drainage, and they have been 
widely used in biomining for extracting nonferrous metals from ores. The osmotic 
stress generated by elevated concentrations of inorganic ions is a severe 
challenge for the growth of Acidithiobacillus spp. in the bioleaching process; 
however, the adaptation mechanism of these bacteria to high osmotic pressure 
remains unclear. In this study, bioinformatics analysis indicated that the 
osmotic stress response two-component system EnvZ-OmpR is widely distributed in 
Acidithiobacillus spp., while OmpRs from Acidithiobacillus spp. exhibited a far 
more evolutionary relationship with the well-studied OmpRs in E. coli and 
Salmonella typhimurium. The growth measurement of an Acidithiobacillus caldus 
(A. caldus) ompR-knockout strain demonstrated that OmpR is essential in the 
adaptation of this bacterium to high osmotic stress. The overall impact of OmpR 
on the various metabolic and regulatory systems of A. caldus was revealed by 
transcriptome analysis. The OmpR binding sequences of differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were predicted, and the OmpR box motif in A. caldus was analysed. 
The direct and negative regulation of EnvZ-OmpR on the tetrathionate-metabolic 
(tetH) cluster in A. caldus was discovered for the first time, and a 
co-regulation mode mediated by EnvZ-OmpR and RsrS-RsrR for the tetrathionate 
intermediate thiosulfate-oxidizing (S4I) pathway in this microorganism was 
proposed. This study reveals that EnvZ-OmpR is an indispensable regulatory 
system for the ability of A. caldus to cope with high osmotic stress and the 
significance of EnvZ-OmpR on the regulation of sulfur metabolism in A. caldus 
adapting to the high-salt environment.

EnvZ, the histidine kinase (HK) of OmpR/EnvZ, transduces osmotic signals in 
Escherichia coli K12 and affects the pathogenicity of Shigella flexneri and 
Vibrio cholera. Avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) is an extra-intestinal 
pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), causing acute and sudden death in poultry and 
leading to severe economic losses to the global poultry industry. How the 
functions of EnvZ correlate with APEC pathogenicity was still unknown. In this 
study, we successfully constructed the envZ mutant strain AE17ΔenvZ and the 
inactivation of envZ significantly reduced biofilms and altered red, dry, and 
rough (rdar) morphology. In addition, AE17ΔenvZ was significantly less resistant 
to acid, alkali, osmotic, and oxidative stress conditions. Deletion of envZ 
significantly enhanced sensitivity to specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken serum 
and increased adhesion to chicken embryonic fibroblast DF-1 cells and elevated 
inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, IL6, and IL8 expression levels. Also, when compared 
with the WT strain, AE17ΔenvZ attenuated APEC pathogenicity in chickens. To 
explore the molecular mechanisms underpinning envZ in APEC17, we compared the WT 
and envZ-deletion strains using transcriptome analyses. RNA-Seq results 
identified 711 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the envZ mutant strain 
and DEGs were mainly enriched in outer membrane proteins, stress response 
systems, and TCSs. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) 
showed that EnvZ influenced the expression of biofilms and stress responses 
genes, including ompC, ompT, mlrA, basR, hdeA, hdeB, adiY, and uspB. We provided 
compelling evidence showing EnvZ contributed to APEC pathogenicity by regulating 
biofilms and stress response expression.

Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) are a unique bacterial group that live 
by predating on other bacteria, consuming them from within to grow and replicate 
before the progeny come out to complete the life cycle. The mechanisms by which 
these predators recognize their prey and differentiate them from nonprey 
bacteria, however, are still not clear. Through genetic knockout and 
complementation studies in different Escherichia coli strains, we found that 
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strain 109J recognizes outer membrane porin F (OmpF) 
on the E. coli surface and that the activity of the E. coli EnvZ-OmpR regulatory 
system significantly impacts predation kinetics. OmpF is not the only signal by 
which BALOs recognize their prey, however, as B. bacteriovorus could eventually 
predate on the E. coli ΔompF mutant after prolonged incubation. Furthermore, 
recognizing OmpF as a prey surface structure was dependent on the prey strain, 
as knocking out OmpF protein homologues in other prey species, including 
Escherichia fergusonii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella enterica, did not 
always reduce the predation rate. Consequently, although OmpF was found to be an 
important surface component used by Bdellovibrio to efficiently recognize and 
attack E. coli, future work is needed to determine what other prey surface 
structures are recognized by these predators. IMPORTANCE Bdellovibrio 
bacteriovorus and like organisms (BALOs) are Gram-negative predatory bacteria 
that attack other Gram-negative bacteria by penetrating their periplasm and 
consuming them from within to obtain the nutrients necessary for the predator's 
growth and replication. How these predators recognize their prey, however, has 
remained a mystery. Here, we show that the outer membrane porin F (OmpF) in E. 
coli is recognized by B. bacteriovorus strain 109J and that the loss of this 
protein leads to severely delayed predation. However, predation of several other 
prey species was not dependent on the recognition of this protein or its 
homologues, indicating that there are other structures recognized by the 
predators on the prey surface that are yet to be discovered.

The exquisite specificity between a sensor kinase and its cognate response 
regulator ensures faithful partner selectivity within two-component pairs 
concurrently firing in a single bacterium, minimizing crosstalk with other 
members of this conserved family of paralogous proteins. We show that conserved 
hydrophobic and charged residues on the surface of thioredoxin serve as a 
docking station for structurally diverse response regulators. Using the OmpR 
protein, we identify residues in the flexible linker and the C-terminal 
β-hairpin that enable associations of this archetypical response regulator with 
thioredoxin, but are dispensable for interactions of this transcription factor 
to its cognate sensor kinase EnvZ, DNA or RNA polymerase. Here we show that the 
promiscuous interactions of response regulators with thioredoxin foster the flow 
of information through otherwise highly dedicated two-component signaling 
systems, thereby enabling both the transcription of Salmonella pathogenicity 
island-2 genes as well as growth of this intracellular bacterium in macrophages 
and mice.

Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are widespread types of protein 
machinery, typically consisting of a histidine kinase membrane sensor and a 
cytoplasmic transcriptional regulator that can sense and respond to 
environmental signals. TCSs are responsible for modulating genes involved in a 
multitude of bacterial functions, including cell division, motility, 
differentiation, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and virulence. 
Pathogenic bacteria exploit the capabilities of TCSs to reprogram gene 
expression according to the different niches they encounter during host 
infection. This review focuses on the role of TCSs in regulating the virulence 
phenotype of Shigella, an intracellular pathogen responsible for severe human 
enteric syndrome. The pathogenicity of Shigella is the result of the complex 
action of a wide number of virulence determinants located on the chromosome and 
on a large virulence plasmid. In particular, we will discuss how five TCSs, 
EnvZ/OmpR, CpxA/CpxR, ArcB/ArcA, PhoQ/PhoP, and EvgS/EvgA, contribute to linking 
environmental stimuli to the expression of genes related to virulence and 
fitness within the host. Considering the relevance of TCSs in the expression of 
virulence in pathogenic bacteria, the identification of drugs that inhibit TCS 
function may represent a promising approach to combat bacterial infections.

BACKGROUND: Outer membrane porins (OMPs) are a major route for the entry of 
small hydrophilic antibiotics. Thus, compositional modulation of OMPs is often 
accompanied by multidrug resistance in a human pathogen Salmonella enterica 
serovar Enteritidis.
OBJECTIVES: The role of EnvZ/OmpR two-component system in antibiotic resistance 
has not been established except that it regulates the expression of two OMPs, 
OmpC and OmpF. Here, we have gained mechanistic insight into EnvZ/OmpR-mediated 
antibiotic resistance in S. Enteritidis.
METHODS: The envZP248L and envZH243A strains, mimicking the S. Enteritidis 
strains with active and inactive states of EnvZ/OmpR, were used in this study. 
Antibiotic resistance was determined by the broth microdilution method and the 
spot plating assay. Transcriptomes of the S. Enteritidis strains were analysed 
by RNA-seq. Western blot, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, 
electrophoretic mobility shift assays and β-galactosidase activity assays were 
performed.
RESULTS: The active state of EnvZ/OmpR induced a differential expression of 
multiple OMP genes including SEN1522, SEN2875, ompD and ompW, enhancing 
resistance to β-lactams in S. Enteritidis. OmpR directly activated SEN1522 and 
SEN2875 but repressed ompD and ompW. Interestingly, an increased cellular level 
of OmpR determined the expression of the four OMP genes, and phosphorylation of 
OmpR was even not necessary for the repression of ompD and ompW. EnvZ/OmpR 
increased its own expression in response to β-lactams, decreasing outer membrane 
permeability and providing S. Enteritidis with benefits for survival upon 
exposure to the antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: EnvZ/OmpR remodels OMP composition in response to β-lactams and 
thereby enhances antibiotic resistance in S. Enteritidis.

The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a serious threat to 
public health worldwide. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising antibiotic 
alternatives; however, little is known about bacterial mechanisms of AMP 
resistance and the interplay between AMP resistance and the bacterial response 
to other antimicrobials. In this study, we identified Escherichia coli mutants 
resistant to the TAT-RasGAP317-326 antimicrobial peptide and found that 
resistant bacteria show collateral sensitivity to other AMPs and antibacterial 
agents. We determined that resistance to TAT-RasGAP317-326 peptide arises 
through mutations in the histidine kinase EnvZ, a member of the EnvZ/OmpR 
two-component system responsible for osmoregulation in E. coli. In particular, 
we found that TAT-RasGAP317-326 binding and entry is compromised in E. coli 
peptide-resistant mutants. We showed that peptide resistance is associated with 
transcriptional regulation of a number of pathways and EnvZ-mediated resistance 
is dependent on the OmpR response regulator but is independent of the OmpC and 
OmpF outer membrane porins. Our findings provide insight into the bacterial 
mechanisms of TAT-RasGAP317-326 resistance and demonstrate that resistance to 
this AMP is associated with collateral sensitivity to other antibacterial 
agents. IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are promising alternatives to 
classical antibiotics in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Resistance 
toward antimicrobial peptides can occur, but little is known about the 
mechanisms driving this phenomenon. Moreover, there is limited knowledge on how 
AMP resistance relates to the bacterial response to other antimicrobial agents. 
Here, we address these questions in the context of the antimicrobial peptide 
TAT-RasGAP317-326. We show that resistant Escherichia coli strains can be 
selected and do not show resistance to other antimicrobial agents. Resistance is 
caused by a mutation in a regulatory pathway, which lowers binding and entry of 
the peptide in E. coli. Our results highlight a mechanism of resistance that is 
specific to TAT-RasGAP317-326. Further research is required to characterize 
these mechanisms and to evaluate the potential of antimicrobial combinations to 
curb the development of antimicrobial resistance.

Avian colibacillosis is a serious systemic infectious disease in poultry and 
caused by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). Previous studies have shown 
that 2-component systems (TCSs) are involved in the pathogenicity of APEC. OmpR, 
a response regulator of OmpR/EnvZ TCS, plays an important role in E. coli K-12. 
However, whether OmpR correlates with APEC pathogenesis has not been 
established. In this study, we constructed an ompR gene mutant and complement 
strains by using the CRISPR-Cas9 system and found that the inactivation of the 
ompR gene attenuated bacterial motility, biofilm formation, and the production 
of curli. The resistance to environmental stress, serum sensitivity, adhesion, 
and invasion of DF-1 cells, and pathogenicity in chicks were all significantly 
reduced in the mutant strain AE17ΔompR. These phenotypes were restored in the 
complement strain AE17C-ompR. The qRT-PCR results showed that OmpR influences 
the expression of genes associated with the flagellum, biofilm formation, and 
virulence. These findings indicate that the regulator OmpR contributes to APEC 
pathogenicity by affecting the expression and function of virulence factors.

Antibiotic killing does not occur at a single, precise time for all cells within 
a population. Variability in time to death can be caused by stochastic 
expression of genes, resulting in differences in endogenous stress-resistance 
levels between individual cells in a population. Here we investigate whether 
single-cell differences in gene expression prior to antibiotic exposure are 
related to cell survival times after antibiotic exposure for a range of genes of 
diverse function. We quantified the time to death of single cells under 
antibiotic exposure in combination with expression of reporters. For some 
reporters, including genes involved in stress response and cellular processes 
like metabolism, the time to cell death had a strong relationship with the 
initial expression level of the genes. Our results highlight the single-cell 
level non-uniformity of antibiotic killing and also provide examples of key 
genes where cell-to-cell variation in expression is strongly linked to extended 
durations of antibiotic survival.

Acid-adapted strains of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 were obtained by serial 
culture in medium buffered at pH 4.6 (M. M. Harden, A. He, K. Creamer, M. W. 
Clark, I. Hamdallah, K. A. Martinez, R. L. Kresslein, S. P. Bush, and J. L. 
Slonczewski, Appl Environ Microbiol 81:1932-1941, 2015, 
https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.03494-14). Revised genomic analysis of these strains 
revealed insertion sequence (IS)-driven insertions and deletions that knocked 
out regulators CadC (acid induction of lysine decarboxylase), GadX (acid 
induction of glutamate decarboxylase), and FNR (anaerobic regulator). Each 
acid-evolved strain showed loss of one or more amino acid decarboxylase systems, 
which normally help neutralize external acid (pH 5 to 6) and increase survival 
in extreme acid (pH 2). Strains from populations B11, H9, and F11 had an IS5 
insertion or IS-mediated deletion in cadC, while population B11 had a point 
mutation affecting the arginine activator adiY The cadC and adiY mutants failed 
to neutralize acid in the presence of exogenous lysine or arginine. In strain 
B11-1, reversion of an rpoC (RNA polymerase) mutation partly restored 
arginine-dependent neutralization. All eight strains showed deletion or 
downregulation of the Gad acid fitness island. Strains with the Gad deletion 
lost the ability to produce GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and failed to survive 
extreme acid. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of strain B11-1 showed 
upregulated genes for catabolism of diverse substrates but downregulated acid 
stress genes (the biofilm regulator ariR, yhiM, and Gad). Other strains showed 
downregulation of H2 consumption mediated by hydrogenases (hya and hyb) which 
release acid. Strains F9-2 and F9-3 had a deletion of fnr and showed 
downregulation of FNR-dependent genes (dmsABC, frdABCD, hybABO, nikABCDE, and 
nrfAC). Overall, strains that had evolved in buffered acid showed loss or 
downregulation of systems that neutralize unbuffered acid and showed altered 
regulation of catabolism.IMPORTANCE Experimental evolution of an enteric 
bacterium under a narrow buffered range of acid pH leads to loss of genes that 
enhance fitness above or below the buffered pH range, including loss of enzymes 
that may raise external pH in the absence of buffer. Prominent modes of 
evolutionary change involve IS-mediated insertions and deletions that knock out 
key regulators. Over generations of acid stress, catabolism undergoes 
reregulation in ways that differ for each evolving strain.

Benzoic acid, a partial uncoupler of the proton motive force (PMF), selects for 
sensitivity to chloramphenicol and tetracycline during the experimental 
evolution of Escherichia coli K-12. Transcriptomes of E. coli isolates evolved 
with benzoate showed the reversal of benzoate-dependent regulation, including 
the downregulation of multidrug efflux pump genes, the gene for the Gad acid 
resistance regulon, the nitrate reductase genes narHJ, and the gene for the 
acid-consuming hydrogenase Hyd-3. However, the benzoate-evolved strains had 
increased expression of OmpF and other large-hole porins that admit fermentable 
substrates and antibiotics. Candidate genes identified from benzoate-evolved 
strains were tested for their roles in benzoate tolerance and in chloramphenicol 
sensitivity. Benzoate or salicylate tolerance was increased by deletion of the 
Gad activator ariR or of the acid fitness island from slp to the end of the gadX 
gene encoding Gad regulators and the multidrug pump genes mdtEF Benzoate 
tolerance was also increased by deletion of multidrug component gene emrA, RpoS 
posttranscriptional regulator gene cspC, adenosine deaminase gene add, 
hydrogenase gene hyc (Hyd-3), and the RNA chaperone/DNA-binding regulator gene 
hfq Chloramphenicol resistance was decreased by mutations in genes for global 
regulators, such as RNA polymerase alpha subunit gene rpoA, the Mar activator 
gene rob, and hfq Deletion of lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic kinase gene rfaY 
decreased the rate of growth in chloramphenicol. Isolates from experimental 
evolution with benzoate had many mutations affecting aromatic biosynthesis and 
catabolism, such as aroF (encoding tyrosine biosynthesis) and apt (encoding 
adenine phosphoribosyltransferase). Overall, benzoate or salicylate exposure 
selects for the loss of multidrug efflux pumps and of hydrogenases that generate 
a futile cycle of PMF and upregulates porins that admit fermentable nutrients 
and antibiotics.IMPORTANCE Benzoic acid is a common food preservative, and 
salicylic acid (2-hydroxybenzoic acid) is the active form of aspirin. At high 
concentrations, benzoic acid conducts a proton across the membrane, depleting 
the proton motive force. In the absence of antibiotics, benzoate exposure 
selects against proton-driven multidrug efflux pumps and upregulates porins that 
admit fermentable substrates but that also allow the entry of antibiotics. Thus, 
evolution with benzoate and related molecules, such as salicylates, requires a 
trade-off for antibiotic sensitivity, a trade-off that could help define a 
stable gut microbiome. Benzoate and salicylate are naturally occurring plant 
signal molecules that may modulate the microbiomes of plants and animal 
digestive tracts so as to favor fermenters and exclude drug-resistant pathogens.

Drug exporters contribute to the intrinsic drug resistance in many organisms. 
Although there are at least 20 exporter genes in Escherichia coli, most of them 
apparently do not confer drug resistance in complex laboratory media except for 
the AcrAB, EmrE, and MdfA efflux systems. In this study, we comprehensively 
investigated the growth phase-dependent expression of drug exporter genes. The 
expression of acrAB, emrAB, emrD, emrE, emrKY, mdfA, and ydgFE is stable at 
moderate levels during any growth phase, whereas mdtEF promoter activity greatly 
increased with cell growth and reached the maximum level at the late stationary 
phase. The growth phase-dependent increase in mdtEF expression was also observed 
on quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. As expected from the 
transporter expression, the stationary-phase cells actually showed 
MdtEF-dependent tolerance to drugs and toxic dyes. Growth phase-dependent 
elevation of mdtEF expression was found to be mediated by the stationary-phase 
sigma factor rpoS and the RpoS-dependent signaling pathway, Hfq, GadY, and GadX. 
The induction level was decreased by tnaAB deletion, suggesting that indole 
sensing stimulates this process.

A previous bioinformatics-based search for small RNAs in Escherichia coli 
identified a novel RNA named IS183. The gene encoding this small RNA is located 
between and on the opposite strand of genes encoding two transcriptional 
regulators of the acid response, gadX (yhiX) and gadW (yhiW). Given that IS183 
is encoded in the gad gene cluster and because of its role in regulating acid 
response genes reported here, this RNA has been renamed GadY. We show that GadY 
exists in three forms, a long form consisting of 105 nucleotides and two 
processed forms, consisting of 90 and 59 nucleotides. The expression of this 
small RNA is highly induced during stationary phase in a manner that is 
dependent on the alternative sigma factor sigmaS. Overexpression of the three 
GadY RNA forms resulted in increased levels of the mRNA encoding the GadX 
transcriptional activator, which in turn caused increased levels of the GadA and 
GadB glutamate decarboxylases. A promoter mutation which abolished gadY 
expression resulted in a reduction in the amount of gadX mRNA during stationary 
phase. The gadY gene was shown to overlap the 3' end of the gadX gene, and this 
overlap region was found to be necessary for the GadY-dependent accumulation of 
gadX mRNA. We suggest that during stationary phase, GadY forms base pairs with 
the 3'-untranslated region of the gadX mRNA and confers increased stability, 
allowing for gadX mRNA accumulation and the increased expression of downstream 
acid resistance genes.

The regulation of chromosomal replication is critical and the activation of DnaA 
by ATP binding is a key step in replication initiation. However, it remains 
unclear whether and how the process of ATP-binding to DnaA is regulated. Here, 
we show that DnaA can be acetylated, and its acetylation level varies with cell 
growth and correlates with DNA replication initiation frequencies in E. coli. 
Specifically, the conserved K178 in Walker A motif of DnaA can be acetylated and 
its acetylation level reaches the summit at the stationary phase, which prevents 
DnaA from binding to ATP or oriC and leads to inhibition of DNA replication 
initiation. The deacetylation process of DnaA is catalyzed by deacetylase CobB. 
The acetylation process of DnaA is mediated by acetyltransferase YfiQ, and 
nonenzymatically by acetyl-phosphate. These findings suggest that the reversible 
acetylation of DnaA ensures cells to respond promptly to environmental changes. 
Since Walker A motif is universally distributed across organisms, acetylation of 
Walker A motif may present a novel regulatory mechanism conserved from bacteria 
to eukaryotes.

The Burkholderia multivorans strain ATCC 17616 carries three circular 
chromosomes with sizes of 3.4, 2.5, and 0.9 Mb. To reveal the distribution and 
organization of the genes for fundamental cell functions on the genome of this 
bacterium, the dnaA and dnaK gene regions of ATCC 17616 were cloned and 
characterized. The gene organization of the dnaA region was 
rnpA-rmpH-dnaA-dnaN-gyrB with a single consensus DnaA-binding box (TTATCCACA) 
between the rmpH and dnaA genes. This intergenic region, however, did not work 
as an autonomously replicating sequence in ATCC 17616. On the other hand, the 
gene organization of the dnaK region was grpE-orf1 (gene for thioredoxin 
homologue)-dnaK-dnaJ-pabB (gene for p-aminobenzoate synthetase component 
homologue). A putative heat-shock promoter that showed good homology to the 
sigma32-dependent promoter consensus sequence in Escherichia coli was found 
upstream of the grpE gene, suggesting that these five genes constitute an 
operon. In M9 succinate minimal medium the dnaJ mutant grew more slowly than the 
wild-type strain, indicating that this operon is functional. Pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis and Southern blot analyses indicated that both the dnaA and dnaK 
gene regions exist as single copies on the 3.4 Mb chromosome.

A 13-kb DNA fragment containing oriC and the flanking genes thdF, orf900, yidC, 
rnpA, rpmH, oriC, dnaA, dnaN, recF, and gyrB was cloned from the gram-negative 
plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 17. These genes are 
conserved in order with other eubacterial oriC genes and code for proteins that 
share high degrees of identity with their homologues, except for orf900, which 
has a homologue only in Xylella fastidiosa. The dnaA/dnaN intergenic region (273 
bp) identified to be the minimal oriC region responsible for autonomous 
replication has 10 pure AT clusters of four to seven bases and only three 
consensus DnaA boxes. These findings are in disagreement with the notion that 
typical oriCs contain four or more DnaA boxes located upstream of the dnaA gene. 
The X. campestris pv. campestris 17 attB site required for site-specific 
integration of cloned fragments from filamentous phage phiLf replicative form 
DNA was identified to be a dif site on the basis of similarities in nucleotide 
sequence and function with the Escherichia coli dif site required for chromosome 
dimer resolution and whose deletion causes filamentation of the cells. The oriC 
and dif sites were located at 12:00 and 6:00, respectively, on the circular X. 
campestris pv. campestris 17 chromosome map, similar to the locations found for 
E. coli sites. Computer searches revealed the presence of both the dif site and 
XerC/XerD recombinase homologues in 16 of the 42 fully sequenced eubacterial 
genomes, but eight of the dif sites are located far away from the 6:00 point 
instead of being placed opposite the cognate oriC. The differences in the 
relative position suggest that mechanisms different from that of E. coli may 
participate in the control of chromosome replication.

Conserved promoter motif is required for cell cycle timing of dnaX transcription 
in Caulobacter.

Keiler KC(1), Shapiro L.

California 94305, USA.

Cells use highly regulated transcriptional networks to control temporally 
regulated events. In the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, many cellular 
processes are temporally regulated with respect to the cell cycle, and the genes 
required for these processes are expressed immediately before the products are 
needed. Genes encoding factors required for DNA replication, including dnaX, 
dnaA, dnaN, gyrB, and dnaK, are induced at the G(1)/S-phase transition. By 
analyzing mutations in the dnaX promoter, we identified a motif between the -10 
and -35 regions that is required for proper timing of gene expression. This 
motif, named RRF (for repression of replication factors), is conserved in the 
promoters of other coordinately induced replication factors. Because mutations 
in the RRF motif result in constitutive gene expression throughout the cell 
cycle, this sequence is likely to be the binding site for a cell cycle-regulated 
transcriptional repressor. Consistent with this hypothesis, Caulobacter extracts 
contain an activity that binds specifically to the RRF in vitro.

The key elements of the initiation of Helicobacter pylori chromosome 
replication, DnaA protein and putative oriC region, have been characterized. The 
gene arrangement in the H.pylori dnaA region differs from that found in many 
other eubacterial dnaA regions (rnpA-rmpH-dnaA-dnaN-recF-gyrB). Helicobacter 
pylori dnaA is flanked by two open reading frames with unknown function, while 
dnaN-gyrB and rnpA-rmpH loci are separated from the dnaA gene by 600 and 90 kb, 
respectively. We show that the dnaA gene encoding initiator protein DnaA is 
expressed in H.pylori cells. The H.pylori DnaA protein, like other DnaA 
proteins, can be divided into four domains. Here we demonstrate that the 
C-terminal domain of H.pylori DnaA protein is responsible for DNA binding. Using 
in silico and in vitro studies, the putative oriC region containing five DnaA 
boxes has been located upstream of the dnaA gene. DNase I and gel retardation 
analyses show that the C-terminal domain of H.pylori DnaA protein specifically 
binds each of five DnaA boxes.

An 18.5-kb DNA fragment containing the oriC region of the chromosome of the 
alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C-125 was obtained by PCR and sequenced. 
Sixteen open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in this region. A sequencing 
similarity search using the BSORF database found that ORF1 to 13 all had 
significant similarities to gene products of Bacillus subtilis. Three other ORFs 
(ORF14-16) of unknown function were positioned down-stream of gyrB instead of 
rrnO, which is found in the same region in the case of B. subtilis. The ORF 
organization from gidA to gyrA was the same as that of B. subtilis. The gene 
organization and the location of the DnaA-box region were also similar to those 
of the chromosomes of other bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas 
putida. There were two DnaA-box clusters (Box-region C and R) with a consensus 
sequence TTATCCACA on both sides of the dnaA gene but another DnaA box cluster 
(Box-region L) which is found in the region between thdF and jag in B. subtilis 
was not found in the corresponding region in the case of alkaliphilic Bacillus 
halodurans C-125.

Sequence analysis of a 34.7-kb DNA segment from the genome of Buchnera 
aphidicola (endosymbiont of aphids) containing groEL, dnaA, the atp operon, 
gidA, and rho.

Buchnera aphidicola is a prokaryotic endosymbiont of the aphid Schizaphis 
graminum. From past and present nucleotide sequence analyses of the B. 
aphidicola genome, we have assembled a 34. 7-kilobase (kb) DNA segment. This 
segment contains genes coding for 32 open reading frames (ORFs), which 
corresponded to 89.9% of the DNA. All of these ORFs could be identified with 
homologous regions of the Escherichia coli genome. The order of the genes with 
established functions was groELS-trmE-rnpA-rpmH-dnaA-dnaN-gyrB-atpCDGAH 
FEB-gidA-fdx-hscA- hscB-nifS-ilvDC-rep-trxA-rho. The order of genes in small DNA 
fragments was conserved in both B. aphidicola and E. coli. Most of these 
fragments were in approximately the same region of the E. coli genome. The 
latter organism, however, contained many additional inserted genes within and 
between the fragments. The results of the B. aphidicola genome analyses indicate 
that the endosymbiont has many properties of free-living bacteria.

Buchnera aphidicola is an intracellular prokaryote (endosymbiont) that lives in 
the body cavity of the aphid. Phylogenetic studies indicated that it is closely 
related to Escherichia coli and members of Enterobacteria. The gene order of the 
region containing the dnaA gene is well conserved in many bacteria. Seven genes 
of the endosymbiont of the aphid Schizaphis graminum, gyrB, dnaN, dnaA, rpmH, 
rnpA, yidD, and 60K. were found to be homologous in sequence and relative 
location to those of E. coli. We have further sequenced the region downstream of 
the 60K gene to elucidate the boundary of the conserved region, and found that 
one more gene, thdF, is conserved. The comparison of gene organizations of the 
dnaA region of the related bacteria supported the close phylogenetic 
relationship of B. aphidicola to E. coli. In addition, we have identified groES 
and groEL genes next to the thdF gene. GroEL protein was reported to be 
expressed at an elevated level in the endosymbionts of aphids, and is considered 
to play an important role in their association with the aphid host. Comparison 
of the structure of the groE operon with that of the endosymbiont of the aphid 
Acyrthosiphon pisum revealed the conservation of a sequence resembling the E. 
coli consensus heat shock promoter, and this sequence may be responsible for the 
high expression of the groEL gene in aphid endosymbionts.

The genus Mycobacterium is composed of species with widely differing growth 
rates ranging from approximately three hours in Mycobacterium smegmatis to two 
weeks in Mycobacterium leprae. As DNA replication is coupled to cell 
duplication, it may be regulated by common mechanisms. The chromosomal regions 
surrounding the origins of DNA replication from M. smegmatis, M. tuberculosis, 
and M. leprae have been sequenced, and show very few differences. The gene 
order, rnpA-rpmH-dnaA-dnaN-recF-orf-gyrB-gyrA, is the same as in other 
Gram-positive organisms. Although the general organization in M. smegmatis is 
very similar to that of Streptomyces spp., a closely related genus, M. 
tuberculosis and M. leprae differ as they lack an open reading frame, between 
dnaN and recF, which is similar to the gnd gene of Escherichia coli. Within the 
three mycobacterial species, there is extensive sequence conservation in the 
intergenic regions flanking dnaA, but more variation from the consensus DnaA box 
sequence was seen than in other bacteria. By means of subcloning experiments, 
the putative chromosomal origin of replication of M. smegmatis, containing the 
dnaA-dnaN region, was shown to promote autonomous replication in M. smegmatis, 
unlike the corresponding regions from M. tuberculosis or M. leprae.

We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 3.5 kb segment in the recF 
region of the Staphylococcus aureus chromosome. The gene order at this locus, 
dnaA-dnaN-recF-gyrB is similar to that found in the replication origin region of 
many other bacteria. S. aureus RecF protein (predicted molecular mass 42.3 kDa), 
has 57% amino acid sequence identity with the Bacillus subtilis RecF protein 
(42.2 kDa), but only 26% with the Escherichia coli RecF protein (40.5 kDa). We 
have shown that the S. aureus recF gene partially complements the defect of a B. 
subtilis recF mutant, but does not complement an E. coli recF strain. The amino 
acid sequence alignment of seven available RecF proteins (five of them from 
bacteria of gram-negative origin) allowed us to identify eight highly conserved 
regions (alpha to theta) and to predict five new conserved regions within the 
gram-positive group (a to f). We suggest that the basic mechanism of homologous 
recombination is conserved among free-living bacteria.

An improved vector system for constructing transcriptional lacZ fusions: 
analysis of regulation of the dnaA, dnaN, recF and gyrB genes of Escherichia 
coli.

Macián F(1), Pérez-Roger I, Armengod ME.

Author information:
(1)Instituto de Investigaciones Citológicas, Fundación Valenciana de 
Investigaciones Biomédicas, Valencia, Spain.

We describe a new vector system for the in vitro construction of transcriptional 
fusions to the lacZ gene, which is expressed from the translational start 
signals of galK. The galK ribosome-binding site (RBS) and its natural preceding 
region ensure a constant efficiency for lacZ translation and, thus, the 
beta-galactosidase (beta Gal) production of a given fusion is directly 
proportional to the in vivo transcriptional activity of the inserted DNA 
fragment. Single-copy lambda prophage versions of multicopy constructs can be 
made by in vivo recombination. We use this system to compare the transcriptional 
activities of the promoters present in the dnaA-dnaN-recF-gyrB cluster. The 
order of strength of these promoters is gyrB > dnaA > recF > dnaN. It is assumed 
that gyrB belongs to the dnaA-dnaN-recF operon, because the short recF-gyrB 
intercistronic region does not contain a terminator. By using this new vector 
system, we have detected strong termination signals within recF that are 
functional even when recF is translated at its normal rate. The low level of 
transcription coming to the end of recF, and the highest activity of the gyrB 
promoter, as well as results obtained with several gyrB::lacZ translational 
fusions, support the conclusion that gyrB is predominantly expressed from its 
own promoter under standard growth conditions. Finally, we have found that 
transcription from the dnaA promoters is constant at different growth rates. 
This supports the idea that autoregulation of the dnaA gene is responsible for 
the coupling of the DnaA protein synthesis to cell mass increase, and 
accumulation of DnaA protein governs the initiation of chromosome replication.

Regulation of the putative bglPH operon for aryl-beta-glucoside utilization in 
Bacillus subtilis.

Krüger S(1), Hecker M.

Author information:
(1)Institut für Mikrobiologie und Molekularbiologie, 
Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität, Greifswald, Germany.

The expression of the putative operon bglPH of Bacillus subtilis was studied by 
using bglP'-lacZ transcriptional fusions. The bglP gene encodes an 
aryl-beta-glucoside-specific enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate 
sugar:phosphotransferase system, whereas the bglH gene product functions as a 
phospho-beta-glucosidase. Expression of bglPH is regulated by at least two 
different mechanisms: (i) carbon catabolite repression and (ii) induction via an 
antitermination mechanism. Distinct deletions of the promoter region were 
created to determine cis-acting sites for regulation. An operatorlike structure 
partially overlapping the -35 box of the promoter of bglP appears to be the 
catabolite-responsive element of this operon. The motif is similar to that of 
amyO and shows no mismatches with respect to the consensus sequence established 
as the target of carbon catabolite repression in B. subtilis. Catabolite 
repression is abolished in both ccpA and ptsH1 mutants. The target of the 
induction by the substrate, salicin or arbutin, is a transcriptional terminator 
located downstream from the promoter of bglP. This structure is very similar to 
that of transcriptional terminators which regulate the induction of the B. 
subtilis sacB gene, the sacPA operon, and the Escherichia coli bgl operon. The 
licT gene product, a member of the BglG-SacY family of antitermination proteins, 
is essential for the induction process. Expression of bglP is under the negative 
control of its own gene product. The general proteins of the 
phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system are required for bglP 
expression. Furthermore, the region upstream from bglP, which reveals a high AT 
content, exerts a negative regulatory effect on bglP expression.

New beta-glucoside (bgl) genes in Bacillus subtilis: the bglP gene product has

The Bacillus subtilis sacY and sacT genes encode antiterminator proteins, 
similar to the Escherichia coli bglG gene product and required for transcription 
of sucrose metabolism genes. A Tn10 insertion into bglP (formerly sytA) has been 
previously identified as restoring sucrose utilization to a strain with 
deletions of both sacY and sacT. The nucleotide sequence of bglP showed a high 
degree of homology with the E. coli bglF gene (BglF is a beta-glucoside permease 
of the phosphotransferase system and also acts as a negative regulator of the 
BglG antiterminator). Complementation studies of an E. coli strain with a 
deletion of the bgl operon showed that BglP was a functional beta-glucoside 
permease. In B. subtilis, bglP complemented in trans both the bglP::Tn10 
original insertion and a phenotypically similar bglP deletion. Disruption of 
licT abolished the suppressor phenotype in a bglP mutant. LicT is a recently 
identified third B. subtilis antiterminator of the BglG/SacY family. These 
observations indicated that BglP was also a negative regulator of LicT. Both 
LicT and BglP seem to be involved in the induction by beta-glucosides of an 
operon containing at least two genes, bglP itself and bglH, encoding a 
phospho-beta-glucosidase. Other beta-glucoside genes homologous to bglP and bglH 
have been recently described in B. subtilis. Thus, B. subtilis possesses several 
sets of beta-glucoside genes, like E. coli, but these genes do not appear to be 
cryptic.

The gut of the termite Reticulitermes santonensis contains an interesting 
diversity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms not found elsewhere. 
These microorganisms produce many enzyme-digesting lignocellulosic compounds, 
probably in cooperation with endogenous enzymes. Regarding cellulose and 
hemicellulose digestion in the termite gut, much remains to be learned about the 
relative contributions of termite enzymes and enzymes produced by different 
microorganisms. Here we grew bacterial colonies from termite gut suspensions, 
identifying 11 of them after PCR amplification of their 16S rRNA genes. After 
constructing in Escherichia coli a genomic DNA library corresponding to all of 
the colonies obtained, we performed functional screening for α-amylase, 
xylanase, β-glucosidase, and endoglucanase activities. This screen revealed a 
clone producing β-glucosidase activity. Sequence analysis showed that the cloned 
genomic DNA fragment contained three complete ORFs (bglG, bglF, and bglB) 
organized in a putative bgl operon. The new β-glucosidase (BglB), identified 
with its regulators BglG and BglF, belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 1. The 
new β-glucosidase was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity 
chromatography. The purified enzyme shows maximal activity at pH 6.0 and 40 °C. 
It also displays β-xylosidase activity.

The beta-glucoside genes of Klebsiella aerogenes: conservation and divergence in 
relation to the cryptic bgl genes of Escherichia coli.

The ability to metabolize aromatic beta-glucosides such as salicin and arbutin 
varies among members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The ability of Escherichia coli 
to degrade salicin and arbutin appears to be cryptic, subject to activation of 
the bgl genes, whereas many members of the Klebsiella genus can metabolize these 
sugars. We have examined the genetic basis for beta-glucoside utilization in 
Klebsiella aerogenes. The Klebsiella equivalents of bglG, bglB and bglR have 
been cloned using the genome sequence database of Klebsiella pneumoniae. 
Nucleotide sequencing shows that the K. aerogenes bgl genes show substantial 
similarities to the E. coli counterparts. The K. aerogenes bgl genes in multiple 
copies can also complement E. coli mutants deficient in bglG encoding the 
antiterminator and bglB encoding the phospho-beta-glucosidase, suggesting that 
they are functional homologues. The regulatory region bglR of K. aerogenes shows 
a high degree of similarity of the sequences involved in BglG-mediated 
regulation. Interestingly, the regions corresponding to the negative elements 
present in the E. coli regulatory region show substantial divergence in K. 
aerogenes. The possible evolutionary implications of the results are discussed.

Phenotypic variability of beta-glucoside utilization and its correlation to 
pathogenesis process in a few enteric bacteria.

Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. aru@teacher.com

Utilization of beta-glucosides is markedly variable in the members of the family 
Enterobacteriaceae. The results presented here provide molecular clues for 
evolutionary events that resulted in the phenotypic variability seen amongst the 
members of these species. The genomic hybridization of selected 
Enterobacteriaceae members with the Escherichia coli bgl and cel genes resulted 
in detection of a complete homolog of the bgl and cel operons in Shigella 
sonnei, a member that is evolutionarily closest to E. coli. However, the 
Salmonella group of organisms have been shown to carry only a homolog of bglR 
and bglG regions and the deletions of the bglF and bglB genes. Similarly, 
Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and a non-enteric Gram-negative 
bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to carry a homolog of the bglR 
and bglG regions and deletions of the bglF and bglB genes. The homolog of the 
cel operon could be identified in S. sonnei and Salmonella groups of organisms. 
Possible implications of these observations, in connection with the phenotypic 
variability seen in beta-glucoside utilization amongst these members, are 
discussed.

Analysis of the beta-glucoside utilization (bgl) genes of Shigella sonnei: 
evolutionary implications for their maintenance in a cryptic state.

Kharat AS(1), Mahadevan S(1).

Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India1.

The pattern of expression of the genes involved in the utilization of aryl 
beta-glucosides such as arbutin and salicin is different in the genus Shigella 
compared to Escherichia coli. The results presented here indicate that the 
homologue of the cryptic bgl operon of E. coli is conserved in Shigella sonnei 
and is the primary system involved in beta-glucoside utilization in the 
organism. The organization of the bgl genes in S. sonnei is similar to that of 
E. coli; however there are three major differences in terms of their pattern of 
expression. (i) The bglB gene, encoding phospho-beta-glucosidase B, is 
insertionally inactivated in S. sonnei. As a result, mutational activation of 
the silent bgl promoter confers an Arbutin-positive (Arb(+)) phenotype to the 
cells in a single step; however, acquiring a Salicin-positive (Sal(+)) phenotype 
requires the reversion or suppression of the bglB mutation in addition. (ii) 
Unlike in E. coli, a majority of the activating mutations (conferring the Arb(+) 
phenotype) map within the unlinked hns locus, whereas activation of the E. coli 
bgl operon under the same conditions is predominantly due to insertions within 
the bglR locus. (iii) Although the bgl promoter is silent in the wild-type 
strain of S. sonnei (as in the case of E. coli), transcriptional and functional 
analyses indicated a higher basal level of transcription of the downstream 
genes. This was correlated with a 1 bp deletion within the putative 
Rho-independent terminator present in the leader sequence preceding the 
homologue of the bglG gene. The possible evolutionary implications of these 
differences for the maintenance of the genes in the cryptic state are discussed.

Effects of Global and Specific DNA-Binding Proteins on Transcriptional 
Regulation of the E. coli bgl Operon.

Using reporter gene (lacZ) transcriptional fusions, we examined the 
transcriptional dependencies of the bgl promoter (Pbgl) and the entire operon 
regulatory region (Pbgl-bglG) on eight transcription factors as well as the 
inducer, salicin, and an IS5 insertion upstream of Pbgl. Crp-cAMP is the primary 
activator of both Pbgl and the bgl operon, while H-NS is a strong dominant 
operon repressor but only a weak repressor of Pbgl. H-NS may exert its 
repressive effect by looping the DNA at two binding sites. StpA is a relatively 
weak repressor in the absence of H-NS, while Fis also has a weak repressive 
effect. Salicin has no effect on Pbgl activity but causes a 30-fold induction of 
bgl operon expression. Induction depends on the activity of the BglF 
transporter/kinase. IS5 insertion has only a moderate effect on Pbgl but causes 
a much greater activation of the bgl operon expression by preventing the full 
repressive effects of H-NS and StpA. While several other transcription factors 
(BglJ, RcsB, and LeuO) have been reported to influence bgl operon transcription 
when overexpressed, they had little or no effect when present at wild type 
levels. These results indicate the important transcriptional regulatory 
mechanisms operative on the bgl operon in E. coli.

The gut of the termite Reticulitermes santonensis contains an interesting 
diversity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms not found elsewhere. 
These microorganisms produce many enzyme-digesting lignocellulosic compounds, 
probably in cooperation with endogenous enzymes. Regarding cellulose and 
hemicellulose digestion in the termite gut, much remains to be learned about the 
relative contributions of termite enzymes and enzymes produced by different 
microorganisms. Here we grew bacterial colonies from termite gut suspensions, 
identifying 11 of them after PCR amplification of their 16S rRNA genes. After 
constructing in Escherichia coli a genomic DNA library corresponding to all of 
the colonies obtained, we performed functional screening for α-amylase, 
xylanase, β-glucosidase, and endoglucanase activities. This screen revealed a 
clone producing β-glucosidase activity. Sequence analysis showed that the cloned 
genomic DNA fragment contained three complete ORFs (bglG, bglF, and bglB) 
organized in a putative bgl operon. The new β-glucosidase (BglB), identified 
with its regulators BglG and BglF, belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 1. The 
new β-glucosidase was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity 
chromatography. The purified enzyme shows maximal activity at pH 6.0 and 40 °C. 
It also displays β-xylosidase activity.

The phosphotransferase system (PTS) controls preferential use of sugars in 
bacteria. It comprises of two general proteins, enzyme I (EI) and HPr, and 
various sugar-specific permeases. Using fluorescence microscopy, we show here 
that EI and HPr localize near the Escherichia coli cell poles. Polar 
localization of each protein occurs independently, but HPr is released from the 
poles in an EI- and sugar-dependent manner. Conversely, the β-glucoside-specific 
permease, BglF, localizes to the cell membrane. EI, HPr and BglF control the 
β-glucoside utilization (bgl) operon by modulating the activity of the BglG 
transcription factor; BglF inactivates BglG by membrane sequestration and 
phosphorylation, whereas EI and HPr activate it by an unknown mechanism in 
response to β-glucosides availability. Using biochemical, genetic and imaging 
methodologies, we show that EI and HPr interact with BglG and affect its 
subcellular localization in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Upon sugar 
stimulation, BglG migrates from the cell periphery to the cytoplasm through the 
poles. Hence, the PTS components appear to control bgl operon expression by 
ushering BglG between the cellular compartments. Our results reinforce the 
notion that signal transduction in bacteria involves dynamic localization of 
proteins.

coli by the PTS.

BglG, which regulates expression of the beta-glucoside utilization (bgl) operon 
in Escherichia coli, represents a family of RNA-binding transcriptional 
antiterminators that positively regulate transcription of sugar utilization 
genes in Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. BglG is negatively regulated 
by the beta-glucoside phosphotransferase, BglF, by means of phosphorylation and 
physical association, and it is positively regulated by the general 
phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) proteins, enzyme I (EI) and 
HPr. We studied the positive regulation of BglG both in vitro and in vivo. Here, 
we show that although EI and HPr are essential for BglG activity, this mode of 
activation does not require phosphorylation of BglG by HPr, as opposed to the 
phosphorylation-mediated activation of many BglG-like antiterminators in 
Gram-positive organisms. The effect of EI and HPr on BglG is not mediated by 
BglF. Nevertheless, the release of BglG from BglF, which is stimulated by the 
extracellular sugar in a sugar uptake-independent manner, is a prerequisite for 
BglG activation. Taken together, the results indicate that activation of BglG is 
a 2-stage process: a sugar-stimulated release from the membrane-bound sugar 
sensor followed by a phosphorylation-independent stimulatory effect exerted by 
the general PTS proteins.

BglF catalyzes beta-glucoside phosphotransfer across the cytoplasmic membrane in 
Escherichia coli. In addition, BglF acts as a sugar sensor that controls 
expression of beta-glucoside utilization genes by reversibly phosphorylating the 
transcriptional antiterminator BglG. Thus, BglF can exist in two opposed states: 
a nonstimulated state that inactivates BglG by phosphorylation and a 
sugar-stimulated state that activates BglG by dephosphorylation and 
phosphorylates the incoming sugar. Sugar phosphorylation and BglG 
(de)phosphorylation are both catalyzed by the same residue, Cys24. To 
investigate the coordination and the structural requirements of the opposing 
activities of BglF, we conducted a genetic screen that led to the isolation of 
mutations that shift the balance toward BglG phosphorylation. We show that some 
of the mutants that are impaired in dephosphorylation of BglG retained the 
ability to catalyze the concurrent activity of sugar phosphotransfer. These 
mutations map to two regions in the BglF membrane domain that, based on their 
predicted topology, were suggested to be implicated in activity. Using in vivo 
cross-linking, we show that a glycine in the membrane domain, whose substitution 
impaired the ability of BglF to dephosphorylate BglG, is spatially close to the 
active-site cysteine located in a hydrophilic domain. This residue is part of a 
newly identified motif conserved among beta-glucoside permeases associated with 
RNA-binding transcriptional antiterminators. The phenotype of the BglF mutants 
could be suppressed by BglG mutants that were isolated by a second genetic 
screen. In summary, we identified distinct sites in BglF that are involved in 
regulating phosphate flow via the common active-site residue in response to 
environmental cues.

The bgl sensory system: a transmembrane signaling pathway controlling 
transcriptional antitermination.

School, P.O.Box 12272, Jerusalem 91120, Israel. amster@cc.huji.ac.il

The bgl system represents a family of sensory systems composed of membrane-bound 
sugar-sensors and transcriptional antiterminators, which regulate expression of 
genes involved in sugar utilization in response to the presence of the 
corresponding sugar in the growth medium. The BglF sensor catalyzes different 
activities depending on its stimulation state: in its non-stimulated state, it 
phosphorylates the BglG transcriptional regulator, thus inactivating it; in the 
presence of the stimulating sugar, it transports the sugar and phosphorylates it 
and also activates BglG by dephosphorylation, leading to bgl operon expression. 
The sugar stimulates BglF by inducing a change in its membrane topology. BglG 
exists in several conformations: a dimer, which is active, and compact and 
non-compact monomers, which are inactive. BglF modulates the transition of BglG 
from one conformation to another, depending on sugar availability. The two Bgl 
proteins form a pre-complex at the membrane that dissociates upon stimulation, 
enabling BglG to exert its effect on transcription.

Dynamic membrane topology of the Escherichia coli beta-glucoside transporter 
BglF.

The Escherichia coli BglF protein, a permease of the 
phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, catalyzes transport and 
phosphorylation of beta-glucosides. In addition, BglF regulates bgl operon 
expression by controlling the activity of the transcriptional regulator BglG via 
reversible phosphorylation. BglF is composed of three domains; one is 
hydrophobic, which presumably forms the sugar translocation channel. We studied 
the topology of this domain by Cys-replacement mutagenesis and chemical 
modification by thiol reagents. Most Cys substitutions were well tolerated, as 
demonstrated by the ability of the mutant proteins to catalyze BglF activities. 
Our results suggest that the membrane domain contains eight transmembrane 
helices and an alleged cytoplasmic loop that contains two additional helices. 
The latter region forms a dynamic structure, as evidenced by the alternation of 
residues near its ends between faced-in and faced-out states. We suggest that 
this region, together with the two transmembrane helices encompassing it, forms 
the sugar translocation channel. BglF periplasmic loops are close to the 
membrane, the first being a reentrant loop. This is the first systematic 
topological study carried out with an intact phosphotransferase system permease 
and the first demonstration of a reentrant loop in this group of proteins.

Modulation of monomer conformation of the BglG transcriptional antiterminator 
from Escherichia coli.

School, P. O. Box 12272, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.

The BglG protein positively regulates expression of the bgl operon in 
Escherichia coli by binding as a dimer to the bgl transcript and preventing 
premature termination of transcription in the presence of beta-glucosides. BglG 
activity is negatively controlled by BglF, the beta-glucoside 
phosphotransferase, which reversibly phosphorylates BglG according to 
beta-glucoside availability, thus modulating its dimeric state. BglG consists of 
an RNA-binding domain and two homologous domains, PRD1 and PRD2. Based on 
structural studies of a BglG homologue, the two PRDs fold similarly, and the 
interactions within the dimer are PRD1-PRD1 and PRD2-PRD2. We have recently 
shown that the affinity between PRD1 and PRD2 of BglG is high, and a fraction of 
the BglG monomers folds in the cell into a compact conformation, in which PRD1 
and PRD2 are in close proximity. We show here that both BglG forms, the compact 
and noncompact, bind to the active site-containing domain of BglF, IIB(bgl), in 
vitro. The interaction of BglG with IIB(bgl) or BglF is mediated by PRD2. Both 
BglG forms are detected as phosphorylated proteins after in vitro 
phosphorylation with IIB(bgl) and are dephosphorylated by BglF in vitro in the 
presence of beta-glucosides. Nevertheless, genetic evidence indicates that the 
interaction of IIB(bgl) and BglF with the compact form is seemingly less 
favorable. Using in vivo cross-linking, we show that BglF enhances folding of 
BglG into a compact conformation, whereas the addition of beta-glucosides 
reduces the amount of this form. Based on these results we suggest a model for 
the modulation of BglG conformation and activity by BglF.

A fraction of the BglG transcriptional antiterminator from Escherichia coli

School, P. O. Box 12272, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.

Expression of the bgl operon in Escherichia coli, induced by beta-glucosides, is 
positively regulated by BglG, a transcriptional antiterminator. In the presence 
of inducer, BglG dimerizes and binds to the bgl transcript to prevent premature 
termination of transcription. The dimeric state of BglG is determined by BglF, a 
membrane-bound enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase 
system (PTS), which reversibly phosphorylates BglG according to beta-glucoside 
availability. BglG is composed of an RNA-binding domain followed by two 
homologous PTS regulation domains (PRD1 and PRD2). The predicted structure of 
dimeric LicT, a BglG homologue from Bacillus subtilis, suggests that the two 
PRDs adopt a similar structure and that the interactions within the dimer are 
PRD1-PRD1 and PRD2-PRD2. We have shown recently that the PRD1 and PRD2 domains 
of BglG can form a stable heterodimer. We report here, based on in vitro and in 
vivo cross-linking experiments, that a fraction of BglG is present in the cell 
in a compact form in which PRD1 and PRD2 are in close proximity. The compact 
form is present mainly in the BglG monomers. Our results imply that the 
monomer-dimer transition involves a conformational change. The possible role of 
the compact form in preventing untimely induction of the bgl operon is 
discussed.

Interactions between the PTS regulation domains of the BglG transcriptional 
antiterminator from Escherichia coli.

School, P. O. Box 12272, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.

The E. coli BglG protein inhibits transcription termination within the bgl 
operon in the presence of beta-glucosides. BglG represents a family of 
transcriptional antiterminators that bind to RNA sequences, which partially 
overlap rho-independent terminators, and prevent termination by stabilizing an 
alternative structure of the transcript. The activity of BglG is determined by 
its dimeric state, which is modulated by reversible phosphorylation catalyzed by 
BglF, a PTS permease. Only the non-phosphorylated BglG dimer binds to RNA and 
allows read-through of transcription. BglG is composed of three domains: an 
RNA-binding domain followed by two domains, PRD1 and PRD2 (PTS regulation 
domains), which are similar in their sequence and folding. Based on the 
three-dimensional structure of dimeric LicT, a BglG homologue from Bacillus 
subtilis, the interactions within the dimer are PRD1-PRD1 and PRD2-PRD2. We have 
shown before that PRD2 mediates homodimerization very efficiently. Using genetic 
systems and in vitro techniques that assay and characterize protein-protein 
interactions, we show here that the PRD1 dimerizes very slowly, but once it 
does, the homodimers are stable. These results support our model that formation 
of BglG dimers initiates with PRD2 dimerization followed by zipping up of two 
BglG monomers to create the active RNA-binding domain. Moreover, our results 
demonstrate that PRD1 and PRD2 heterodimerize efficiently in vitro and in vivo. 
The affinity among the PRDs is in the following order: PRD2-PRD2 > PRD1-PRD2 > 
PRD1-PRD1. The interaction between PRD1 and PRD2 offers an explanation for the 
requirement of conserved residues in PRD1 for the phosphorylation of PRD2 by 
BglF.

The binding sites of YihW, an uncharacterized DeoR-family transcription factor 
(TF) of Escherichia coli K-12, were identified using Genomic SELEX screening at 
two closely located sites, one inside the spacer between the bidirectional 
transcription units comprising the yihUTS operon and the yihV gene, and another 
one upstream of the yihW gene itself. Recently the YihUTS and YihV proteins were 
identified as catalysing the catabolism of sulfoquinovose (SQ), a hydrolysis 
product of sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG) derived from plants and other 
photosynthetic organisms. Gel shift assay in vitro and reporter assay in vivo 
indicated that YihW functions as a repressor for all three transcription units. 
De-repression of the yih operons was found to be under the control of SQ as 
inducer, but not of lactose, glucose or galactose. Furthermore, a mode of its 
cooperative DNA binding was suggested for YihW by atomic force microscopy. 
Hence, as a regulator of the catabolism of SQ, we renamed YihW as CsqR.

Comparative genomics analysis of conserved gene cassettes demonstrated 
resemblance between a recently described cassette of genes involved in 
sulphoquinovose degradation in Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and a Bacilli 
cassette linked with lactose degradation. Six genes from both cassettes had 
similar functions related to carbohydrate metabolism, namely, hydrolase, 
aldolase, kinase, isomerase, transporter, and transcription factor. The 
Escherichia coli sulphoglycolysis cassette was thus predicted to be associated 
with lactose degradation. This prediction was confirmed experimentally: 
expression of genes coding for aldolase (yihT), isomerase (yihS), and kinase 
(yihV) was dramatically increased during growth on lactose. These genes were 
previously shown to be activated during growth on sulphoquinovose, so our 
observation may indicate multi-functional capabilities of the respective 
proteins. Transcription starts for yihT, yihV and yihW were mapped in silico, in 
vitro and in vivo. Out of three promoters for yihT, one was active only during 
growth on lactose. We further showed that switches in yihT transcription are 
controlled by YihW, a DeoR-family transcription factor in the Escherichia coli 
cassette. YihW acted as a carbon source-dependent dual regulator involved in 
sustaining the baseline growth in the absence of lac-operon, with function 
either complementary, or opposite to a global regulator of carbohydrate 
metabolism, cAMP-CRP.

Escherichia coli K-12 Suppressor-free Mutants Lacking Early Glycosyltransferases

envelope stress response.

To elucidate the minimal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure needed for the 
viability of Escherichia coli, suppressor-free strains lacking either the 
3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid transferase waaA gene or derivatives of the 
heptosyltransferase I waaC deletion with lack of one or all late 
acyltransferases (lpxL/M/P) and/or various outer membrane biogenesis factors 
were constructed. Delta(waaC lpxL lpxM lpxP) and waaA mutants exhibited highly 
attenuated growth, whereas simultaneous deletion of waaC and surA was lethal. 
Analyses of LPS of suppressor-free waaA mutants grown at 21 degrees C, besides 
showing accumulation of free lipid IV(A) precursor, also revealed the presence 
of its pentaacylated and hexaacylated derivatives, indicating in vivo late 
acylation can occur without Kdo. In contrast, LPS of Delta(waaC lpxL lpxM lpxP) 
strains showed primarily Kdo(2)-lipid IV(A), indicating that these minimal LPS 
structures are sufficient to support growth of E. coli under slow-growth 
conditions at 21/23 degrees C. These lipid IV(A) derivatives could be modified 
biosynthetically by phosphoethanolamine, but not by 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose, 
indicating export defects of such minimal LPS. DeltawaaA and Delta(waaC lpxL 
lpxM lpxP) exhibited cell-division defects with a decrease in the levels of FtsZ 
and OMP-folding factor PpiD. These mutations led to strong constitutive additive 
induction of envelope responsive CpxR/A and sigma(E) signal transduction 
pathways. Delta(lpxL lpxM lpxP) mutant, with intact waaC, synthesized 
tetraacylated lipid A and constitutively incorporated a third Kdo in growth 
medium inducing synthesis of P-EtN and l-Ara4N. Overexpression of msbA restored 
growth of Delta(lpxL lpxM lpxP) under fast-growing conditions, but only 
partially that of the Delta(waaC lpxL lpxM lpxP) mutant. This suppression could 
be alleviated by overexpression of certain mutant msbA alleles or the 
single-copy chromosomal MsbA-498V variant in the vicinity of Walker-box II.

In Escherichia coli, certain mutations in the cpxA gene (encoding a sensor 
kinase of a two-component signal transduction system) randomize the location of 
FtsZ ring assembly and dramatically affect cell division. However, deletion of 
the cpxRA operon, encoding the sensor kinase and its cognate regulator CpxR, has 
no effect on division site biogenesis. It appears that certain mutant sensor 
kinases (CpxA*) either exhibit hyperactivity on CpxR or extend their signalling 
activity to one or more noncognate response regulators involved in cell 
division.

MzrA-EnvZ interactions in the periplasm influence the EnvZ/OmpR two-component 
regulon.

MzrA was identified as a modulator of the EnvZ/OmpR two-component signal 
transduction system. Previous evidence indicated that MzrA interacts with EnvZ 
and modulates its enzymatic activities to influence OmpR phosphate (OmpR∼P) 
levels. Moreover, MzrA was shown to connect the bacterial envelope stress 
response systems CpxA/CpxR and σ(E) to EnvZ/OmpR to widen the defensive response 
regulatory network. In this study, experiments were carried out to establish 
whether the membrane or periplasmic domain of MzrA is critical for MzrA-EnvZ 
interactions and to reveal MzrA residues that play an important role in these 
interactions. Data obtained from chimeric constructs, in which the transmembrane 
domain of MzrA was replaced with the unrelated transmembrane domain of NarX or 
signal sequence of PhoA, showed that the transmembrane domain residues of MzrA 
do not play a critical role in MzrA-EnvZ interactions. The importance of the 
periplasmic domain of MzrA in MzrA-EnvZ interactions was revealed by 
characterizing bifunctional, fully soluble, and periplasmically localized 
MalE::MzrA chimeras. This was further corroborated through the isolation of 
loss-of-function, single-amino-acid substitutions in the conserved periplasmic 
domain of MzrA that interfered with MzrA-EnvZ binding in a bacterial two-hybrid 
system. Together, the data suggest that the binding of MzrA to EnvZ influences 
the ability of EnvZ to receive and/or respond to environmental signals in the 
periplasm and modulate its biochemical output to OmpR.

Escherichia coli uses two-component systems (TCSs) to respond to environmental 
signals. TCSs affect gene expression and are parts of E. coli's global 
transcriptional regulatory network (TRN). Here, we identified the regulons of 
five TCSs in E. coli MG1655: BaeSR and CpxAR, which were stimulated by ethanol 
stress; KdpDE and PhoRB, induced by limiting potassium and phosphate, 
respectively; and ZraSR, stimulated by zinc. We analyzed RNA-seq data using 
independent component analysis (ICA). ChIP-exo data were used to validate 
condition-specific target gene binding sites. Based on these data, we do the 
following: (i) identify the target genes for each TCS; (ii) show how the target 
genes are transcribed in response to stimulus; and (iii) reveal novel 
relationships between TCSs, which indicate noncognate inducers for various 
response regulators, such as BaeR to iron starvation, CpxR to phosphate 
limitation, and PhoB and ZraR to cell envelope stress. Our understanding of the 
TRN in E. coli is thus notably expanded.IMPORTANCE E. coli is a common commensal 
microbe found in the human gut microenvironment; however, some strains cause 
diseases like diarrhea, urinary tract infections, and meningitis. E. coli's 
two-component systems (TCSs) modulate target gene expression, especially related 
to virulence, pathogenesis, and antimicrobial peptides, in response to 
environmental stimuli. Thus, it is of utmost importance to understand the 
transcriptional regulation of TCSs to infer bacterial environmental adaptation 
and disease pathogenicity. Utilizing a combinatorial approach integrating RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq), independent component analysis, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation coupled with exonuclease treatment (ChIP-exo), and data 
mining, we suggest five different modes of TCS transcriptional regulation. Our 
data further highlight noncognate inducers of TCSs, which emphasizes the 
cross-regulatory nature of TCSs in E. coli and suggests that TCSs may have a 
role beyond their cognate functionalities. In summary, these results can lead to 
an understanding of the metabolic capabilities of bacteria and correctly predict 
complex phenotype under diverse conditions, especially when further incorporated 
with genome-scale metabolic models.

The complexities of porin genetic regulation.

De la Cruz MA(1), Calva E.

Cuernavaca, México.

Our understanding of porin regulation has revealed not only increasing 
complexity in the regulatory mechanisms, but also that the porin repertoire is 
more extensive than previously conceived. Initially, the OmpR response regulator 
was described as the master regulator of porin genes, but many more regulators 
are involved such as CpxR, PhoB, Lrp, Rob, MarA, SoxS, CadC, CRP, Fnr, ToxR, 
H-NS, StpA, IHF, HU and LeuO. In addition to MicF, the first small RNA (sRNA) 
that was proposed to regulate porin expression, porins are 
post-transcriptionally regulated by a variety of other sRNAs, namely, MicC, 
MicA, IpeX, RseX, InvR, CyaR and RybB. Future challenges include the full 
integration of all the regulatory circuitries. Whether quiescent porins are 
merely replacements of the major porins or are part of novel metabolic programs 
has yet to be elucidated. The comprehensive exploration of the environmental 
determinants that affect porin gene expression should yield valuable new 
information about the functions of these important proteins.

Identification of UvrY as the cognate response regulator for the BarA sensor 
kinase in Escherichia coli.

BarA is a membrane-associated protein that belongs to a subclass of tripartite 
sensors of the two-component signal transduction system family. In this study, 
we report that UvrY is the cognate response regulator for BarA of Escherichia 
coli. This conclusion is based upon homologies with analogous two-component 
systems and demonstrated by both biochemical and genetic means. We show that the 
purified BarA protein is able to autophosphorylate when incubated with 
[gamma-(32)P]ATP but not with [alpha-(32)P]ATP or [gamma-(32)P]GTP. 
Phosphorylated BarA, in turn, acts as an efficient phosphoryl group donor to 
UvrY but not to the non-cognate response regulators ArcA, PhoB, or CpxR. The 
specificity of the transphosphorylation reaction is further supported by the 
fact that UvrY can receive the phosphoryl group from BarA-P but not from the 
non-cognate tripartite sensor ArcB-P or ATP. In addition, genetic evidence that 
BarA and UvrY mediate the same signal transduction pathway is provided by the 
finding that both uvrY and barA mutant strains exhibit the same hydrogen 
peroxide hypersensitive phenotype. These results provide the first biochemical 
evidence as well as genetic support for a link between BarA and UvrY, suggesting 
that the two proteins constitute a new two-component system for gene regulation 
in Escherichia coli.

Trimethoprim and Other Antimicrobial Drugs.

Although glutathione (GSH) has been shown to influence the antimicrobial effects 
of many kinds of antibiotics, little is known about its role in relation to 
trimethoprim (TMP), a widely used antifolate. In this study, several genes 
related to glutathione metabolism were deleted in different Escherichia coli 
strains (i.e., O157:H7 and ATCC 25922), and their effects on susceptibility to 
TMP were tested. The results showed that deleting gshA, gshB, grxA, and cydD 
caused TMP resistance, and deleting cydD also caused resistance to other drugs. 
Meanwhile, deleting gshA, grxA, and cydD resulted in a significant decrease of 
the periplasmic glutathione content. Supplementing exogenous GSH or further 
deleting glutathione importer genes (gsiB and ggt) restored TMP sensitivity to 
ΔcydD. Subsequently, the results of quantitative-reverse transcription PCR 
experiments showed that expression levels of acrA, acrB, and tolC were 
significantly upregulated in both ΔgrxA and ΔcydD. Correspondingly, deleting 
cydD led to a decreased accumulation of TMP within bacterial cells, and further 
deleting acrA, acrB, or tolC restored TMP sensitivity to ΔcydD. Inactivation of 
CpxR and SoxS, two transcriptional factors that modulate the transcription of 
acrAB-tolC, restored TMP sensitivity to ΔcydD. Furthermore, mutations of gshA, 
gshB, grxA, cydC, and cydD are highly prevalent in E. coli clinical strains. 
Collectively, these data suggest that reducing the periplasmic glutathione 
content of E. coli leads to increased expression of acrAB-tolC with the 
involvement of CpxR and SoxS, ultimately causing drug resistance. To the best of 
our knowledge, this is the first report showing a linkage between periplasmic 
GSH and drug resistance in bacteria. IMPORTANCE After being used extensively for 
decades, trimethoprim still remains one of the key accessible antimicrobials 
recommended by the World Health Organization. A better understanding of the 
mechanisms of resistance would be beneficial for the future utilization of this 
drug. It has been shown that the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump is associated with 
trimethoprim resistance in E. coli clinical strains. In this study, we show that 
E. coli can sense the periplasmic glutathione content with the involvement of 
the CpxAR two-component system. As a result, reducing the periplasmic 
glutathione content leads to increased expression of acrA, acrB, and tolC via 
CpxR and SoxS, causing resistance to antimicrobials, including trimethoprim. 
Meanwhile, mutations in the genes responsible for periplasmic glutathione 
content maintenance are highly prevalent in E. coli clinical isolates, 
indicating a potential correlation of the periplasmic glutathione content and 
clinical antimicrobial resistance, which merits further investigation.

The two-component signal transduction system CpxAR is especially widespread in 
Gram-negative bacteria. It has been reported that CpxAR contributes to the 
multidrug resistance (MDR) in Escherichia coli. CpxR is a response regulator in 
the two-component CpxAR system. The aim of this study was to explore the role of 
cpxR in the MDR of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The minimal inhibitory 
concentrations (MICs) of various antibiotics commonly used in veterinary 
medicine for strains JS (a multidrug-susceptible standard strain of S. enterica 
serovar Typhimurium), JSΔcpxR, JSΔcpxR/pcpxR, JSΔcpxR/pcpxR (*), JSΔcpxRΔacrB, 
JSΔcpxRΔacrB/pcpxR, JSΔcpxRΔacrB/pcpxR (*), 9 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 
isolates (SH1-9), and SH1-9ΔcpxR were determined by the 2-fold broth 
microdilution method. The relative mRNA expression levels of ompF, ompC, ompW, 
ompD, tolC, acrB, acrD, acrF, mdtA, marA, and soxS in strains JS, JSΔcpxR, and 
JSΔcpxR/pcpxR were detected by real-time PCR. The results showed 2- to 4-fold 
decreases in the MICs of amikacin (AMK), gentamycin (GEN), apramycin (APR), 
neomycin (NEO), ceftriaxone (CRO), ceftiofur (CEF), and cefquinome (CEQ) for 
strain JSΔcpxR, as compared to those for the parental strain JS. Likewise, 
SH1-9ΔcpxR were found to have 2- to 8-fold reduction in resistance to the above 
antibiotics, except for NEO, as compared to their parental strains SH1-9. 
Furthermore, 2- to 4-fold further decreases in the MICs of AMK, GEN, APR, and 
CEF for strain JSΔcpxRΔacrB were observed, as compared to those for strain 
JSΔacrB. In addition, CpxR overproduction in strain JSΔcpxR led to significant 
decreases in the mRNA expression levels of ompF, ompC, ompW, ompD, tolC, acrB, 
marA, and soxS, and significant increases in those of stm3031 and stm1530. 
Notably, after all strains were induced simultaneously by GEN to the 15th 
passage at subinhibitory concentrations, strain JSΔcpxR/pcpxR showed significant 
increases in mRNA expression levels of the efflux pump acrD and mdtA genes, as 
compared to strain JSΔcpxR. Our results indicate that the two-component 
regulator CpxR contributes to resistance of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium to 
aminoglycosides and β-lactams by influencing the expression level of the 
MDR-related genes.

OBJECTIVES: In Escherichia coli, there are 32 open reading frames assumed, on 
the basis of sequence similarities, to be response regulator genes of 
two-component signal transduction systems. We cloned all 32 response regulators 
and examined whether or not response regulator-overexpressing cells confer 
resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in E. coli.
METHODS: E. coli KAM3 (acrB), a drug-hypersusceptible mutant, was used as a host 
strain for the overproduction of response regulators. MICs were determined by 
the agar dilution method.
RESULTS: Thirteen response regulators out of 32 genes, namely baeR, cheY, cpxR, 
creB, evgA, fimZ, narL, ompR, rcsB, rstA, yedW, yehT and dcuR, conferred 
increased beta-lactam resistance. Among them, overexpression of baeR, evgA, rcsB 
and dcuR conferred high-level resistance. The baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance 
is due to up-regulation of the expression of multidrug exporter genes, acrD and 
mdtABC for baeR, and yhiUV for evgA, because baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance 
was completely absent in strains lacking these exporter genes. The fimZ-mediated 
cefalothin resistance is due to the chromosomal ampC gene, because the ampC 
deletion strain did not show fimZ-mediated resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-component signal transduction systems contribute to beta-lactam 
resistance in E. coli. Multidrug exporters play roles in two-component signal 
transduction system-mediated beta-lactam resistance.

Transcriptional response of Escherichia coli to external copper.

(1)Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Kinki University, Nakamachi 3327-204, 
Nara 631-8505, Japan.

Transcriptional response of Escherichia coli upon exposure to external copper 
was studied using DNA microarray and in vivo and in vitro transcription assays. 
Transcription of three hitherto-identified copper-responsive genes, copA (copper 
efflux transporter), cueO (multicopper oxidase) and cusC (tripartite copper pump 
component) became maximum at 5 min after addition of copper sulphate, and 
thereafter decreased to the preshift levels within 30 min. Microarray analysis 
at 5 min after addition of copper indicated that a total of at least 29 genes 
including these three known genes were markedly and specifically affected (28 
upregulated and one downregulated). Transcription of the divergent operons, 
cusCFB and cusRS, was found to be activated by CusR, which bound to a CusR box 
between the cusC and cusR promoters. Except for this site, the CusR box was not 
identified in the entire E. coli genome. On the other hand, transcription of 
copA and cueO was found to be activated by another copper-responsive factor 
CueR, which bound to a conserved inverted repeat sequence, CueR box. A total of 
197 CueR boxes were identified on the E. coli genome, including the CueR box 
associated with the moa operon for molybdenum cofactor synthesis. At least 10 
copper-induced genes were found to be under the control of CpxAR two-component 
system, indicating that copper is one of the signals for activation of the CpxAR 
system. In addition, transcription of yedWV, a putative two-component system, 
was activated by copper in CusR-dependent manner. Taken together we conclude 
that the copper-responsive genes are organized into a hierarchy of the 
regulation network, forming at least four regulons, i.e. CueR, CusR, CpxR and 
YedW regulons. These copper-responsive regulons appear to sense and respond to 
different concentrations of external copper.

Escherichia coli adapts its lifestyle to the variations of environmental growth 
conditions, swapping between swimming motility or biofilm formation. The 
stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS is an important regulator of this switch, 
since it stimulates adhesion and represses flagellar biosynthesis. By measuring 
the dynamics of gene expression, we show that RpoS inhibits the transcription of 
the flagellar sigma factor, FliA, in exponential growth phase. RpoS also 
partially controls the expression of CsgD and CpxR, two transcription factors 
important for bacterial adhesion. We demonstrate that these two regulators 
repress the transcription of fliA, flgM, and tar and that this regulation is 
dependent on the growth medium. CsgD binds to the flgM and fliA promoters around 
their -10 promoter element, strongly suggesting direct repression. We show that 
CsgD and CpxR also affect the expression of other known modulators of cell 
motility. We propose an updated structure of the regulatory network controlling 
the choice between adhesion and motility.

Although fosfomycin is an old antibiotic, it has resurfaced with particular 
interest. The antibiotic is still effective against many pathogens that are 
resistant to other commonly used antibiotics. We have found that fosfomycin 
resistance of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is controlled by 
the bacterial two-component signal transduction system CpxAR. A cpxA mutant 
lacking its phosphatase activity results in constitutive activation of its 
cognate response regulator, CpxR, and fosfomycin resistance. We have shown that 
fosfomycin resistance requires CpxR because deletion of the cpxR gene in the 
cpxA mutant restores fosfomycin sensitivity. We have also shown that CpxR 
directly represses the expression of two genes, glpT and uhpT, which encode 
transporters that cotransport fosfomycin with their native substrates 
glycerol-3-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate, and repression of these genes 
leads to a decrease in fosfomycin transport into the cpxA mutant. However, the 
cpxA mutant had an impaired growth phenotype when cultured with 
glycerol-3-phosphate or glucose-6-phosphate as a sole carbon substrate and was 
outcompeted by the parent strain, even in nutrient-rich medium. This suggests a 
trade-off between fosfomycin resistance and the biological fitness associated 
with carbon substrate uptake. We propose a role for the CpxAR system in the 
reversible control of fosfomycin resistance. This may be a beneficial strategy 
for bacteria to relieve the fitness burden that results from fosfomycin 
resistance in the absence of fosfomycin.

In this study, we characterized the CpxRA two-component signal transduction 
system of the rumen bacterium Mannheimia succiniciproducens. The truncated form 
of the CpxA sensor kinase protein without its transmembrane domain was able to 
autophosphorylate and transphosphorylate the CpxR response regulator protein in 
vitro. We identified 152 putative target genes for the Cpx system in M. 
succiniciproducens, which were differentially expressed by more than twofold 
upon overexpression of the CpxR protein. Genes of a putative 16-gene operon 
related to the cell wall and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis were induced 
strongly upon CpxR overexpression. The promoter region of the first gene of this 
operon, wecC encoding UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronate dehydrogenase, was 
analyzed and found to contain a sequence homologous to the CpxR box of 
Escherichia coli. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the 
phosphorylated CpxR proteins were able to bind specifically to PCR-amplified DNA 
fragments containing the promoter sequence of wecC. Furthermore, a 
cpxR-disrupted mutant strain exhibited increased envelope permeability compared 
with a wild-type strain. These results suggest that the Cpx system of M. 
succiniciproducens is involved in the maintenance of the integrity of the cell 
envelope.

The malX malY operon of Escherichia coli encodes a novel enzyme II of the 
phosphotransferase system recognizing glucose and maltose and an enzyme 
abolishing the endogenous induction of the maltose system.

Mutants lacking MalK, a subunit of the binding protein-dependent 
maltose-maltodextrin transport system, constitutively express the maltose genes. 
A second site mutation in malI abolishes the constitutive expression. The malI 
gene (at 36 min on the linkage map) codes for a typical repressor protein that 
is homologous to the Escherichia coli LacI, GalR, or CytR repressor (J. Reidl, 
K. Römisch, M. Ehrmann, and W. Boos, J. Bacteriol. 171:4888-4899, 1989). We now 
report that MalI regulates an adjacent and divergently oriented operon 
containing malX and malY. MalX encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 
56,654, and the deduced amino acid sequence of MalX exhibits 34.9% identity to 
the enzyme II of the phosphototransferase system for glucose (ptsG) and 32.1% 
identity to the enzyme II for N-acetylglucosamine (nagE). When constitutively 
expressed, malX can complement a ptsG ptsM double mutant for growth on glucose. 
Also, a delta malE malT(Con) strain that is unable to grow on maltose due to its 
maltose transport defect becomes Mal+ after introduction of malI::Tn10 and the 
plasmid carrying malX. MalX-mediated transport of glucose and maltose is likely 
to occur by facilitated diffusion. We conclude that malX encodes a 
phosphotransferase system enzyme II that can recognize glucose and maltose as 
substrates even though these sugars may not represent the natural substrates of 
the system. The second gene in the operon, malY, encodes a protein of 43,500 
daltons. Its deduced amino acid sequence exhibits weak homology to 
aminotransferase sequences. The presence of plasmid-encoded MalX alone was 
sufficient for complementing growth on glucose in a ptsM ptsG glk mutant, and 
the plasmid-encoded MalY alone was sufficient to abolish the constitutivity of 
the mal genes in a malK mutant. The overexpression of malY in a strain that is 
wild type with respect to the maltose genes strongly interferes with growth on 
maltose. This is not the case in a malT(Con) strain that expresses the mal genes 
constitutively. We conclude that malY encodes an enzyme that degrades the 
inducer of the maltose system or prevents its synthesis.

Quorum sensing (QS) regulates many natural phenotypes (e.q. virulence, biofilm 
formation, antibiotic resistance), and its components, when incorporated into 
synthetic genetic circuits, enable user-directed phenotypes. We created a 
library of Escherichia coli lsr operon promoters using error-prone PCR (ePCR) 
and selected for promoters that provided E. coli with higher tetracycline 
resistance over the native promoter when placed upstream of the tet(C) gene. 
Among the fourteen clones identified, we found several mutations in the binding 
sites of QS repressor, LsrR. Using site-directed mutagenesis we restored all 
p-lsrR-box sites to the native sequence in order to maintain LsrR repression of 
the promoter, preserving the other mutations for analysis. Two promoter 
variants, EP01rec and EP14rec, were discovered exhibiting enhanced protein 
expression. In turn, these variants retained their ability to exhibit the 
LsrR-mediated QS switching activity. Their sequences suggest regulatory linkage 
between CytR (CRP repressor) and LsrR. These promoters improve upon the native 
system and exhibit advantages over synthetic QS promoters previously reported. 
Incorporation of these promoters will facilitate future applications of 
QS-regulation in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.

Members of the genus Vibrio are important marine and aquaculture pathogens. 
Hemolytic activity has been identified as a virulence factor in many pathogenic 
vibrios including V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, V. harveyi 
and V. vulnificus. We have used transposon mutagenesis to identify genes 
involved in the hemolytic activity of shrimp-pathogenic V. harveyi strain 
PSU3316. Out of 1,764 mutants screened, five mutants showed reduced hemolytic 
activity on sheep blood agar and exhibited virulence attenuation in shrimp 
(Litopenaeus vannamei). Mutants were identified by comparing transposon junction 
sequences to a draft of assembly of the PSU3316 genome. Surprisingly none of the 
disrupted open reading frames or gene neighborhoods contained genes annotated as 
hemolysins. The gene encoding RseB, a negative regulator of the sigma factor 
(σ(E)), was interrupted in 2 out of 5 transposon mutants, in addition, the 
transcription factor CytR, a threonine synthetase, and an efflux-associated 
cytoplasmic protein were also identified. Knockout mutations introduced into the 
rpoE operon at the rseB gene exhibited low hemolytic activity in sheep blood 
agar, and were 3-to 7-fold attenuated for colonization in shrimp. Comparison of 
whole cell extracted proteins in the rseB mutant (PSU4030) to the wild-type by 
2-D gel electrophoresis revealed 6 differentially expressed proteins, including 
two down-regulated porins (OmpC-like and OmpN) and an upregulated protease 
(DegQ) which have been associated with σ(E) in other organisms. Our study is the 
first report linking hemolytic activity to the σ(E) regulators in pathogenic 
Vibrio species and suggests expression of this virulence-linked phenotype is 
governed by multiple regulatory pathways within the V. harveyi.

DNA-binding characteristics of the Escherichia coli CytR regulator: a relaxed 
spacing requirement between operator half-sites is provided by a flexible, 
unstructured interdomain linker.

The Escherichia coli CytR regulator belongs to the LacI family of 
sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins and prevents CRP-mediated transcription 
in the CytR regulon. Unlike the other members of this protein family, CytR binds 
with only modest affinity to its operators and transcription repression thus 
relies on the formation of nucleoprotein complexes with the cAMP-CRP complex. 
Moreover, CytR exhibits a rotational and translational flexibility in operator 
binding that is unprecedented in the LacI family. In this report we examined the 
effect of changing the spacing between CytR half-operators on CytR regulation in 
vivo and on CytR binding in vitro. Maximum repression was seen with the short 
spacing variants: repression peaks when the half-operators lie on the same face 
of the DNA helix. Repression was retained for most spacing variants with centre 
separations of half-operators < or = 3 helical turns. Our data confirm and 
extend the view that CytR is a highly flexible DNA binder that can adapt many 
different conformations for co-operative binding with CRP. Furthermore, limited 
proteolysis of radiolabelled CytR protein showed that the interdomain linker 
connecting the DNA binding domains and the core part of CytR does not become 
structured upon DNA binding. We conclude that CytR does not use hinge 
alpha-helices for minor groove recognition. Rather, CytR possesses a highly 
flexible interdomain linker that allows it to form complexes with CRP at 
promoters with quite different architecture.

Menaquinone (vitamin K2) biosynthesis: localization and characterization of the

A key reaction in the biosynthesis of menaquinone involves the conversion of the 
soluble bicyclic naphthalenoid compound 1, 4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA) 
to the membrane-bound demethylmenaquinone. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction, 
DHNA-octaprenyltransferase, attaches a 40-carbon side chain to DHNA. The menA 
gene encoding this enzyme has been cloned and localized to a 2.0-kb region of 
the Escherichia coli genome between cytR and glpK. DNA sequence analysis of the 
cloned insert revealed a 308-codon open reading frame (ORF), which by deletion 
analyses was shown to restore anaerobic growth of a menA mutant. Reverse-phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of quinones extracted from the 
orf-complemented cells independently confirmed the restoration of menaquinone 
biosynthesis, and similarly, analyses of isolated cell membranes for DHNA 
octaprenyltransferase activity confirmed the introduction of the menA product 
into the orf-complemented menA mutant. The validity of an ORF-associated 
putative promoter sequence was confirmed by primer extension analyses.

The diffusion of KPC-2 carbapenemase is closely related to the spread of 
Klebsiella pneumoniae of the clonal-group 258 and linked to IncFIIK plasmids. 
Little is known about the biology of multi-drug resistant plasmids and the 
reasons of their successful dissemination. Using E. coli TOP10 strain harboring 
a multi-replicon IncFIIK-IncFIB bla KPC-2-gene carrying plasmid pBIC1a from K. 
pneumoniae ST-258 clinical isolate BIC-1, we aimed to identify basal gene 
expression and the effects of imipenem exposure using whole transcriptome 
approach by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Independently of the antibiotic pressure, 
most of the plasmid-backbone genes were expressed at low levels. The most 
expressed pBIC1a genes were involved in antibiotic resistance (bla KPC-2, bla 
TEM and aph(3')-I), in plasmid replication and conjugation, or associated to 
mobile elements. After antibiotic exposure, 34% of E. coli (pBIC1a) genome was 
differentially expressed. Induction of oxidative stress response was evidenced, 
with numerous upregulated genes of the SoxRS/OxyR oxydative stress regulons, the 
Fur regulon (for iron uptake machinery), and IscR regulon (for iron sulfur 
cluster synthesis). Nine genes carried by pBIC1a were up-regulated, including 
the murein DD-endopeptidase mepM and the copper resistance operon. Despite the 
presence of a carbapenemase, we observed a major impact on E. coli (pBIC1a) 
whole transcriptome after imipenem exposure, but no effect on the level of 
transcription of antimicrobial resistance genes. We describe adaptive responses 
of E. coli to imipenem-induced stress, and identified plasmid-encoded genes that 
could be involved in resistance to stressful environments.

Unlike stable RNAs that require processing for maturation, prokaryotic cellular 
mRNAs generally follow an 'all-or-none' pattern. Herein, we used a 5΄ 
monophosphate transcript sequencing (5΄P-seq) that specifically captured the 
5΄-end of processed transcripts and mapped the genome-wide RNA processing sites 
(PSSs) in a methanogenic archaeon. Following statistical analysis and stringent 
filtration, we identified 1429 PSSs, among which 23.5% and 5.4% were located in 
5΄ untranslated region (uPSS) and intergenic region (iPSS), respectively. A 
predominant uridine downstream PSSs served as a processing signature. 
Remarkably, 5΄P-seq detected overrepresented uPSS and iPSS in the polycistronic 
operons encoding ribosomal proteins, and the majority upstream and proximal 
ribosome binding sites, suggesting a regulatory role of processing on 
translation initiation. The processed transcripts showed increased stability and 
translation efficiency. Particularly, processing within the tricistronic 
transcript of rplA-rplJ-rplL enhanced the translation of rplL, which can provide 
a driving force for the 1:4 stoichiometry of L10 to L12 in the ribosome. 
Growth-associated mRNA processing intensities were also correlated with the 
cellular ribosomal protein levels, thereby suggesting that mRNA processing is 
involved in tuning growth-dependent ribosome synthesis. In conclusion, our 
findings suggest that mRNA processing-mediated post-transcriptional regulation 
is a potential mechanism of ribosomal protein synthesis and stoichiometry.

Measurement of the rates of synthesis of three components of ribosomes of 
Mycobacterium fortuitum: a theoretical approach to qRT-PCR experimentation.

Autónoma, Madrid, Spain.

BACKGROUND: Except for the ribosomal protein L12 (rplL), ribosomal proteins are 
present as one copy per ribosome; L12 (rplL) is unusual because it is present as 
four copies per ribosome. Thus, the strategies used by Mycobacterium fortuitum 
to regulate ribosomal protein synthesis were investigated, including evaluations 
of the rates of chain elongations of 16S rRNA, rplL and ribosomal protein S12 
(rpsL).
METHODOLOGY: RNA was isolated from cell cultures and cDNA was prepared. The 
numbers of cDNA copies of 16S rRNA, precursor-16S rRNA and transcripts of rpsL 
and rplL were quantified by qRT-PCR and then related to the rates of 16S rRNA, 
rpsL and rplL chain elongations by means of a mathematical framework for coupled 
transcription/translation.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The rates of synthesis of 16S rRNA, rpsL and rplL 
respectively were found to be approximately 50 x 10(3) nucleotides h(-1), 1.6 x 
10(3) amino acid residues h(-1) and 3.4 x 10(3) amino acid residues h(-1). The 
number of transcripts of rplL was approximately twice that of rpsL. These data 
account for the presence of one copy of rpsL and four copies of rplL per 
ribosome, and reveal that the rate of M. fortuitum ribosome synthesis was closer 
to that of M. tuberculosis than to E. coli. Except for rplJ, the elongation rate 
obtained for rpsL was inferred to be appropriate for all other proteins present 
as one copy per ribosome.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results obtained provide the basis for a comprehensive view of 
the kinetics of ribosome synthesis, and of the ways that bacterial cells utilize 
genes encoding ribosomal proteins. The methodology also applies to proteins 
involved in transcription, energy generation and to bacterial proteins in 
general. The method proposed for measuring the fidelity of cDNA preparations is 
intrinsically much more sensitive than procedures that measure the integrity of 
16S rRNA.

Identification of a growth phase-dependent promoter in the rplJL operon of 
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).

Spain.

A single promoter, rplJp (P(L10)), has been identified in the rplJL operon from 
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) by promoter probe and primer extension analyses. 
P(L10) is located upstream of the rplL gene and of the DNA encoding the mRNA 
leader region that contains the putative L10 (or L10.L12(4)) binding site for 
translational autogenous regulation. The potential start point for transcription 
was found 239 nucleotides upstream of the predicted translational start codon of 
rplJ. The promoter sequence shows -35 and -10 hexamers that resemble those of 
Streptomyces consensus Escherichia coli sigma(70)-like promoters and the rplJp 
from Streptomyces griseus. The amount of the transcript detected by primer 
extension analysis decreases during growth immediately after the transition 
phase, a slowdown in growth occurring during exponential phase associated with 
increases in ppGpp level. The temporal pattern of transcripts shows a clear 
correlation with the temporal pattern of L10 and L7/L12 protein synthesis 
reported in previous kinetic studies. This indicates that P(L10) is a growth 
phase-dependent promoter which may contribute, together with translational 
regulation, to the decrease in the synthesis of L10 and L7/L12 observed in 
liquid minimal medium. This is supported by results of promoter probe 
experiments. Although no significant promoter activity has been found by 
promoter probing in the rplJ and rplL intergenic region, an additional 
5'-transcript end was detected by primer extension, probably as a result of mRNA 
processing event from a longer transcript. This may be required to maintain the 
1:4 ratio observed for L10 and L7/L12 in the ribosomes.

Molecular cloning and characterization of Borrelia burgdorferi rpoB.

Valhalla 10595, USA.

Borrelia burgdorferi rpoB, the gene encoding the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase, 
has been cloned and sequenced. The full-length gene encodes a protein of 1154 
amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 129.8 kDa. The amino-acid 
sequence is 49% identical to the corresponding protein from Escherichia coli. B. 
burgdorferi rpoB is a component of a gene cluster, which includes rplJ, rplL and 
rpoC. A temperature-sensitive E. coli rpoB mutant could be complemented by 
introduction of the B. burgdorferi gene, indicating that the B. burgdorferi rpoB 
is expressed in E. coli and the beta-subunit can be assembled into functional 
holoenzyme. The wild-type amino-acid sequence of the B. burgdorferi beta-subunit 
is consistent with those of spontaneously arising rifampicin-resistant mutants 
of E. coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis at certain critical residues. This 
suggests that the natural resistance of B. burgdorferi to rifampicin may be due 
to the primary amino-acid sequence of its beta-subunit.

Synthesis of ribosomal proteins during growth of Streptomyces coelicolor.

(1)Departamento de Biología Funcional, Universidad de Oviedo, Spain.

Changes in expression of ribosomal protein genes during growth and stationary 
phase of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) in liquid medium were studied. Proteins 
being synthesized were pulse-labelled with [35S]-methionine, separated by 
two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and quantified using the 
BioImage computer software. Most of the ribosomal proteins were synthesized 
throughout the life cycle. Exceptions were two proteins whose synthesis 
drastically decreased at the approach of stationary phase. These two proteins 
were identified in purified ribosomes as homologues of Escherichia coli 
ribosomal proteins L10 and L7/L12, using antibodies raised against fusion 
proteins between these ribosomal proteins and Escherichia coli 
beta-galactosidase. The genes (rplJ and rplL) encoding the L10 and L7/L12 
proteins were contained in a 1.2 kb BamHI fragment that was cloned and 
sequenced. The linkage and order of the genes coincide with other L10-L7/L12 
operons. However, L11 and L1 genes were not present immediately upstream of the 
L10 gene, as is the case for E. coli and other bacteria. Instead, two open 
reading frames of unknown function were found immediately upstream of the L10 
gene, in an adjacent 1.9 kb BamHI fragment.

Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L10 is rapidly degraded when synthesized in 
excess of ribosomal protein L7/L12.

Petersen C(1).

Author information:
(1)Institute of Microbiology, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

In Escherichia coli the genes encoding ribosomal proteins L10 and L7/12, rplJ 
and rplL, respectively, are cotranscribed and subject to translational coupling. 
Synthesis of both proteins is coordinately regulated at the translational level 
by binding of L10 or a complex of L10 and L7/L12 to a single target in the mRNA 
leader region upstream of rplJ. Unexpectedly, small deletions that inactivated 
the ribosome-binding site of the rplL gene carried on multicopy plasmids exerted 
a negative effect on expression of the upstream rplJ gene. This effect could be 
overcome by overproduction of L7/L12 in trans from another plasmid. This 
apparent stimulation resulted from stabilization of the overproduced L10 protein 
by L7/L12, presumably because free L10, in contrast to L10 complexed with 
L7/L12, is subject to rapid proteolytic decay. The contribution of this decay 
mechanism to the regulation of the rplJL operon is evaluated.

Long-range translational coupling in the rplJL-rpoBC operon of Escherichia coli.

Petersen C(1).

Author information:
(1)Institute of Microbiology, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

In Escherichia coli the genes encoding ribosomal proteins L10 and L7/L12, rplJ 
and rplL, are cotranscribed, and translation of both cistrons is regulated by 
binding of L10 or a complex of L10 and L7/L12 to a single target in the mRNA 
leader region. Co-ordinated regulation is assured by some kind of translational 
coupling, the mechanism of which was investigated here by deletion analysis of 
plasmids carrying either the intact rplL gene or rplL-lacZ gene fusions. Unless 
the rplL ribosome binding site was modified by deletion, efficient initiation of 
translation required translation of a region located more than 500 nucleotides 
upstream on the transcript within the rplJ cistron. It is proposed that the 
wild-type rplL ribosome binding site is blocked by long-range RNA base-pairing 
to this region, when translation of the rplJ sequence is inhibited.

Mutants of Bacillus subtilis with electrophoretic variants of ribosomal protein 
L1, L5, L9, or L11 were used to determine the order of the genes for these

Escherichia coli proteins L1, L10, L12, and L11, respectively; using the gene 
locus designations based on this correspondence, we determined the order of the 
loci to be cysA-rplK-rplA-rplJ-rplL-rpoB. The order of the last five loci was 
identical to that of E. coli.

Relative activities of the transcriptional regulatory sites in the rplKAJLrpoBC 
gene cluster of Escherichia coli.

Ralling G, Linn T.

The pattern of transcription of the rplKAJLrpoBC gene cluster of Escherichia 
coli appears to be complex. At least four different promoters and a 
transcriptional attenuator have been identified. To compare the relative effect 
of each of the putative promoters and the attenuator on transcription of these 
genes, we fused these regulatory sites to lacZ. These transcriptional fusions 
were constructed on lambda transducing phages so a single copy of each could be 
stably integrated into the chromosome. The level of beta-galactosidase in a 
lysogen of each phage reflects the activity of the transcriptional regulatory 
site. We find that the promoters preceding rplK (rplKp) and rplJ (rplJp) are 
indeed the major promoters of this gene cluster. The minor promoter before rplL 
(rplLp) is much weaker and contributes little to the transcription of the 
downstream genes. Under these conditions, we find no evidence of a promoter 
(rpoBp) in the rplL-rpoB intercistronic region. The attenuator (atn) terminates 
ca. 70% of the transcripts initiated at the promoters preceding it. Although we 
cannot rule out that some transcripts from rplKp may read through into 
rplJLrpoBC, we find that rplJp alone is sufficient for high-level expression of 
these genes.

Unlike stable RNAs that require processing for maturation, prokaryotic cellular 
mRNAs generally follow an 'all-or-none' pattern. Herein, we used a 5΄ 
monophosphate transcript sequencing (5΄P-seq) that specifically captured the 
5΄-end of processed transcripts and mapped the genome-wide RNA processing sites 
(PSSs) in a methanogenic archaeon. Following statistical analysis and stringent 
filtration, we identified 1429 PSSs, among which 23.5% and 5.4% were located in 
5΄ untranslated region (uPSS) and intergenic region (iPSS), respectively. A 
predominant uridine downstream PSSs served as a processing signature. 
Remarkably, 5΄P-seq detected overrepresented uPSS and iPSS in the polycistronic 
operons encoding ribosomal proteins, and the majority upstream and proximal 
ribosome binding sites, suggesting a regulatory role of processing on 
translation initiation. The processed transcripts showed increased stability and 
translation efficiency. Particularly, processing within the tricistronic 
transcript of rplA-rplJ-rplL enhanced the translation of rplL, which can provide 
a driving force for the 1:4 stoichiometry of L10 to L12 in the ribosome. 
Growth-associated mRNA processing intensities were also correlated with the 
cellular ribosomal protein levels, thereby suggesting that mRNA processing is 
involved in tuning growth-dependent ribosome synthesis. In conclusion, our 
findings suggest that mRNA processing-mediated post-transcriptional regulation 
is a potential mechanism of ribosomal protein synthesis and stoichiometry.

Measurement of the rates of synthesis of three components of ribosomes of 
Mycobacterium fortuitum: a theoretical approach to qRT-PCR experimentation.

Autónoma, Madrid, Spain.

BACKGROUND: Except for the ribosomal protein L12 (rplL), ribosomal proteins are 
present as one copy per ribosome; L12 (rplL) is unusual because it is present as 
four copies per ribosome. Thus, the strategies used by Mycobacterium fortuitum 
to regulate ribosomal protein synthesis were investigated, including evaluations 
of the rates of chain elongations of 16S rRNA, rplL and ribosomal protein S12 
(rpsL).
METHODOLOGY: RNA was isolated from cell cultures and cDNA was prepared. The 
numbers of cDNA copies of 16S rRNA, precursor-16S rRNA and transcripts of rpsL 
and rplL were quantified by qRT-PCR and then related to the rates of 16S rRNA, 
rpsL and rplL chain elongations by means of a mathematical framework for coupled 
transcription/translation.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The rates of synthesis of 16S rRNA, rpsL and rplL 
respectively were found to be approximately 50 x 10(3) nucleotides h(-1), 1.6 x 
10(3) amino acid residues h(-1) and 3.4 x 10(3) amino acid residues h(-1). The 
number of transcripts of rplL was approximately twice that of rpsL. These data 
account for the presence of one copy of rpsL and four copies of rplL per 
ribosome, and reveal that the rate of M. fortuitum ribosome synthesis was closer 
to that of M. tuberculosis than to E. coli. Except for rplJ, the elongation rate 
obtained for rpsL was inferred to be appropriate for all other proteins present 
as one copy per ribosome.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results obtained provide the basis for a comprehensive view of 
the kinetics of ribosome synthesis, and of the ways that bacterial cells utilize 
genes encoding ribosomal proteins. The methodology also applies to proteins 
involved in transcription, energy generation and to bacterial proteins in 
general. The method proposed for measuring the fidelity of cDNA preparations is 
intrinsically much more sensitive than procedures that measure the integrity of 
16S rRNA.

Relative activities of the transcriptional regulatory sites in the rplKAJLrpoBC 
gene cluster of Escherichia coli.

Ralling G, Linn T.

The pattern of transcription of the rplKAJLrpoBC gene cluster of Escherichia 
coli appears to be complex. At least four different promoters and a 
transcriptional attenuator have been identified. To compare the relative effect 
of each of the putative promoters and the attenuator on transcription of these 
genes, we fused these regulatory sites to lacZ. These transcriptional fusions 
were constructed on lambda transducing phages so a single copy of each could be 
stably integrated into the chromosome. The level of beta-galactosidase in a 
lysogen of each phage reflects the activity of the transcriptional regulatory 
site. We find that the promoters preceding rplK (rplKp) and rplJ (rplJp) are 
indeed the major promoters of this gene cluster. The minor promoter before rplL 
(rplLp) is much weaker and contributes little to the transcription of the 
downstream genes. Under these conditions, we find no evidence of a promoter 
(rpoBp) in the rplL-rpoB intercistronic region. The attenuator (atn) terminates 
ca. 70% of the transcripts initiated at the promoters preceding it. Although we 
cannot rule out that some transcripts from rplKp may read through into 
rplJLrpoBC, we find that rplJp alone is sufficient for high-level expression of 
these genes.

In the process of Escherichia coli K-12 growth from exponential phase to 
stationary, marked alteration takes place in the pattern of overall genome 
expression through modulation of both parts of the transcriptional and 
translational apparatus. In transcription, the sigma subunit with promoter 
recognition properties is replaced from the growth-related factor RpoD by the 
stationary-phase-specific factor RpoS. The unused RpoD is stored by binding with 
the anti-sigma factor Rsd. In translation, the functional 70S ribosome is 
converted to inactive 100S dimers through binding with the ribosome modulation 
factor (RMF). Up to the present time, the regulatory mechanisms of expression of 
these two critical proteins, Rsd and RMF, have remained totally unsolved. In 
this study, attempts were made to identify the whole set of transcription 
factors involved in transcription regulation of the rsd and rmf genes using the 
newly developed promoter-specific transcription factor (PS-TF) screening system. 
In the first screening, 74 candidate TFs with binding activity to both of the 
rsd and rmf promoters were selected from a total of 194 purified TFs. After 6 
cycles of screening, we selected 5 stress response TFs, ArcA, McbR, RcdA, SdiA, 
and SlyA, for detailed analysis in vitro and in vivo of their regulatory roles. 
Results indicated that both rsd and rmf promoters are repressed by ArcA and 
activated by McbR, RcdA, SdiA, and SlyA. We propose the involvement of a number 
of TFs in simultaneous and coordinated regulation of the transcriptional and 
translational apparatus. By using genomic SELEX (gSELEX) screening, each of the 
five TFs was found to regulate not only the rsd and rmf genes but also a variety 
of genes for growth and survival. IMPORTANCE During the growth transition of E. 
coli from exponential phase to stationary, the genome expression pattern is 
altered markedly. For this alteration, the transcription apparatus is altered by 
binding of anti-sigma factor Rsd to the RpoD sigma factor for sigma factor 
replacement, while the translation machinery is modulated by binding of RMF to 
70S ribosome to form inactive ribosome dimer. Using the PS-TF screening system, 
a number of TFs were found to bind to both the rsd and rmf promoters, of which 
the regulatory roles of 5 representative TFs (one repressor ArcA and the four 
activators McbR, RcdA, SdiA, and SlyA) were analyzed in detail. The results 
altogether indicated the involvement of a common set of TFs, each sensing a 
specific environmental condition, in coordinated hibernation of the 
transcriptional and translational apparatus for adaptation and survival under 
stress conditions.

Bacteria exposed to stress survive by regulating the expression of several genes 
at the transcriptional and translational levels. For instance, in Escherichia 
coli, when growth is arrested in response to stress, such as nutrient 
starvation, the anti-sigma factor Rsd is expressed to inactivate the global 
regulator RpoD and activate the sigma factor RpoS. However, ribosome modulation 
factor (RMF) expressed in response to growth arrest binds to 70S ribosomes to 
form inactive 100S ribosomes and inhibit translational activity. Moreover, 
stress due to fluctuations in the concentration of metal ions essential for 
various intracellular pathways is regulated by a homeostatic mechanism involving 
metal-responsive transcription factors (TFs). Therefore, in this study, we 
examined the binding of a few metal-responsive TFs to the promoter regions of 
rsd and rmf through promoter-specific TF screening and studied the effects of 
these TFs on the expression of rsd and rmf in each TF gene-deficient E. coli 
strain through quantitative PCR, Western blot imaging, and 100S ribosome 
formation analysis. Our results suggest that several metal-responsive TFs (CueR, 
Fur, KdpE, MntR, NhaR, PhoP, ZntR, and ZraR) and metal ions (Cu2+, Fe2+, K+, 
Mn2+, Na+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) influence rsd and rmf gene expression while 
regulating transcriptional and translational activities.

Transcription and translation in growing phase of Escherichia coli, the 
best-studied model prokaryote, are coupled and regulated in coordinate fashion. 
Accordingly, the growth rate-dependent control of the synthesis of RNA 
polymerase (RNAP) core enzyme (the core component of transcription apparatus) 
and ribosomes (the core component of translation machinery) is tightly 
coordinated to keep the relative level of transcription apparatus and 
translation machinery constant for effective and efficient utilization of 
resources and energy. Upon entry into the stationary phase, transcription 
apparatus is modulated by replacing RNAP core-associated sigma (promoter 
recognition subunit) from growth-related RpoD to stationary-phase-specific RpoS. 
The anti-sigma factor Rsd participates for the efficient replacement of sigma, 
and the unused RpoD is stored silent as Rsd-RpoD complex. On the other hand, 
functional 70S ribosome is transformed into inactive 100S dimer by two 
regulators, ribosome modulation factor (RMF) and hibernation promoting factor 
(HPF). In this review article, we overview how we found these factors and what 
we know about the molecular mechanisms for silencing transcription apparatus and 
translation machinery by these factors. In addition, we provide our recent 
findings of promoter-specific transcription factor (PS-TF) screening of the 
transcription factors involved in regulation of the rsd and rmf genes. Results 
altogether indicate the coordinated regulation of Rsd and RMF for simultaneous 
hibernation of transcription apparatus and translation machinery.

by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Alginate overproduction, or mucoidy, plays an important role in the pathogenesis 
of P. aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF). Mucoid strains with 
mucA mutations predominantly populate in chronically-infected patients. However, 
the mucoid strains can revert to nonmucoidy in vitro through suppressor 
mutations. We screened a mariner transposon library using CF149, a non-mucoid 
clinical isolate with a misssense mutation in algU (AlgU(A61V)). The wild type 
AlgU is a stress-related sigma factor that activates transcription of alginate 
biosynthesis. Three mucoid mutants were identified with transposon insertions 
that caused 1) an overexpression of AlgU(A61V), 2) an overexpression of the 
stringent starvation protein A (SspA), and 3) a reduced expression of the major 
sigma factor RpoD (σ(70)). Induction of AlgU(A61V) in trans caused conversion to 
mucoidy in CF149 and PAO1DalgU, suggesting that AlgU(A61V) is functional in 
activating alginate production. Furthermore, the level of AlgU(A61V) was 
increased in all three mutants relative to CF149. However, compared to the wild 
type AlgU, AlgU(A61V) had a reduced activity in promoting alginate production in 
PAO1ΔalgU. SspA and three other anti-σ(70) orthologues, P. aeruginosa AlgQ, E. 
coli Rsd, and T4 phage AsiA, all induced mucoidy, suggesting that reducing 
activity of RpoD is linked to mucoid conversion in CF149. Conversely, RpoD 
overexpression resulted in suppression of mucoidy in all mucoid strains tested, 
indicating that sigma factor competition can regulate mucoidy. Additionally, an 
RpoD-dependent promoter (PssrA ) was more active in non-mucoid strains than in 
isogenic mucoid variants. Altogether, our results indicate that the anti-σ(70) 
factors can induce conversion to mucoidy in P. aeruginosa CF149 with 
algU-suppressor mutation via modulation of RpoD.

Involvement of AlgQ in transcriptional regulation of pyoverdine genes in 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.

In response to iron limitation, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces the fluorescent 
siderophore pyoverdine. Transcription of pyoverdine biosynthetic (pvd) genes is 
driven by the iron starvation sigma factor PvdS, which is negatively regulated 
by the Fur-Fe(II) holorepressor. We studied the effect of AlgQ, the Escherichia 
coli Rsd orthologue, on pyoverdine production by P. aeruginosa PAO1. AlgQ is a 
global regulatory protein which activates alginate, ppGpp, and inorganic 
polyphosphate synthesis through a cascade involving nucleoside diphosphate 
kinase (Ndk). AlgQ is also capable of interacting with region 4 of RpoD. In a 
reconstituted E. coli system, PvdS-dependent transcription from the pvdA 
promoter was doubled by the multicopy algQ gene. The P. aeruginosa DeltaalgQ 
mutant exhibited a moderate but reproducible reduction in pyoverdine production 
compared with wild-type PAO1, as a result of a decline in transcription of pvd 
genes. PvdS expression was not affected by the algQ mutation. Single-copy algQ 
fully restored pyoverdine production and expression of pvd genes in the 
DeltaalgQ mutant, while ndk did not. An increased intracellular concentration of 
RpoD mimicked the DeltaalgQ phenotype, whereas PvdS overexpression suppressed 
the algQ mutation. E. coli rsd could partially substitute for algQ in 
transcriptional modulation of pvd genes. We propose that AlgQ acts as an 
anti-sigma factor for RpoD, eliciting core RNA polymerase recruitment by PvdS 
and transcription initiation at pvd promoters. AlgQ provides a link between the 
pyoverdine and alginate regulatory networks. These systems have similarities in 
responsiveness and physiological function: both depend on alternative sigma 
factors, respond to nutrient starvation, and act as virulence determinants for 
P. aeruginosa.

Many regulons controlled by alternative sigma factors, including sigma(S) and 
sigma(32), are poorly induced in cells lacking the alarmone ppGpp. We show that 
ppGpp is not absolutely required for the activity of sigma(S)-dependent 
promoters because underproduction of sigma(70), specific mutations in rpoD 
(rpoD40 and rpoD35), or overproduction of Rsd (anti-sigma(70)) restored 
expression from sigma(S)-dependent promoters in vivo in the absence of ppGpp 
accumulation. An in vitro transcription/competition assay with reconstituted RNA 
polymerase showed that addition of ppGpp reduces the ability of wild-type 
sigma(70) to compete with sigma(32) for core binding and the mutant sigma(70) 
proteins, encoded by rpoD40 and rpoD35, compete less efficiently than wild-type 
sigma(70). Similarly, an in vivo competition assay showed that the ability of 
both sigma(32) and sigma(S) to compete with sigma(70) is diminished in cells 
lacking ppGpp. Consistently, the fraction of sigma(S) and sigma(32) bound to 
core was drastically reduced in ppGpp-deficient cells. Thus, the stringent 
response encompasses a mechanism that alters the relative competitiveness of 
sigma factors in accordance with cellular demands during physiological stress.

The RecA protein is a key bacterial recombination enzyme that catalyzes pairing 
and strand exchange between homologous DNA duplexes. In Escherichia coli, RecA 
protein assembly on DNA is mediated either by the RecBCD or RecFOR protein 
complexes. Correspondingly, two recombination pathways, RecBCD and RecF (or 
RecFOR), are distinguished in E. coli. Inactivation of both pathways in recB(CD) 
recF(OR) mutants results in severe recombination deficiency. Here we describe a 
novel, RecBCD- RecFOR-independent (RecBFI) recombination pathway that is active 
in ΔrecBCD sbcB15 sbcC(D) ΔrecF(OR) mutants of E. coli. In transductional 
crosses, these mutants show only four-fold decrease of recombination frequency 
relative to the wild-type strain. At the same time they recombine 40- to 90-fold 
better than their sbcB+ sbcC+ and ΔsbcB sbcC counterparts. The RecBFI pathway 
strongly depends on recA, recJ and recQ gene functions, and moderately depends 
on recG and lexA functions. Inactivation of dinI, helD, recX, recN, radA, ruvABC 
and uvrD genes has a slight effect on RecBFI recombination. After exposure to UV 
and gamma irradiation, the ΔrecBCD sbcB15 sbcC ΔrecF mutants show moderately 
increased DNA repair proficiency relative to their sbcB+ sbcC+ and ΔsbcB sbcC 
counterparts. However, introduction of recA730 allele (encoding RecA protein 
with enhanced DNA binding properties) completely restores repair proficiency to 
ΔrecBCD sbcB15 sbcC ΔrecF mutants, but not to their sbcB+ sbcC+ and ΔsbcB sbcC 
derivatives. Fluorescence microscopy with UV-irradiated recA-gfp fusion mutants 
suggests that the kinetics of RecA filament formation might be slowed down in 
the RecBFI pathway. Inactivation of 3'-5' exonucleases ExoVII, ExoIX and ExoX 
cannot activate the RecBFI pathway in ΔrecBCD ΔsbcB sbcC ΔrecF mutants. Taken 
together, our results show that the product of the sbcB15 allele is crucial for 
RecBFI pathway. Besides protecting 3' overhangs, SbcB15 protein might play an 
additional, more active role in formation of the RecA filament.

In RecBCD(+) cells, a mutated single-strand DNA 3'-5' exonuclease ExoI (SbcB15) 
induced an increase in stationary-phase mutation. In sbcB15 cells, as in 
wild-type cells, these mutations partially required RecA, RecB, RecF, and

decreased stationary-phase mutation and induced an increase in the number of

not change significantly the stationary-phase mutation. Differences between the

and the generation of stationary-phase mutations.

The ability to recognize and repair abnormal DNA structures is common to all 
forms of life. Studies in a variety of species have identified an incredible 
diversity of DNA repair pathways. Documenting and characterizing the 
similarities and differences in repair between species has important value for 
understanding the origin and evolution of repair pathways as well as for 
improving our understanding of phenotypes affected by repair (e.g., mutation 
rates, lifespan, tumorigenesis, survival in extreme environments). 
Unfortunately, while repair processes have been studied in quite a few species, 
the ecological and evolutionary diversity of such studies has been limited. 
Complete genome sequences can provide potential sources of new information about 
repair in different species. In this paper, we present a global comparative 
analysis of DNA repair proteins and processes based upon the analysis of 
available complete genome sequences. We use a new form of analysis that combines 
genome sequence information and phylogenetic studies into a composite analysis 
we refer to as phylogenomics. We use this phylogenomic analysis to study the 
evolution of repair proteins and processes and to predict the repair phenotypes 
of those species for which we now know the complete genome sequence.

The ability to recognize and repair abnormal DNA structures is common to all 
forms of life. Studies in a variety of species have identified an incredible 
diversity of DNA repair pathways. Documenting and characterizing the 
similarities and differences in repair between species has important value for 
understanding the origin and evolution of repair pathways as well as for 
improving our understanding of phenotypes affected by repair (e.g., mutation 
rates, lifespan, tumorigenesis, survival in extreme environments). 
Unfortunately, while repair processes have been studied in quite a few species, 
the ecological and evolutionary diversity of such studies has been limited. 
Complete genome sequences can provide potential sources of new information about 
repair in different species. In this paper, we present a global comparative 
analysis of DNA repair proteins and processes based upon the analysis of 
available complete genome sequences. We use a new form of analysis that combines 
genome sequence information and phylogenetic studies into a composite analysis 
we refer to as phylogenomics. We use this phylogenomic analysis to study the 
evolution of repair proteins and processes and to predict the repair phenotypes 
of those species for which we now know the complete genome sequence.

Escherichia coli hupA hypB double mutants that lack HU protein have severe 
cellular defects in cell division, DNA folding, and DNA partitioning. Here we 
show that the sfiA11 mutation, which alters the SfiA cell division inhibitor, 
reduces filamentation and production of anucleate cells in AB1157 hupA hupB 
strains. However, lexA3(Ind-) and sfiB(ftsZ)114 mutations, which normally 
counteract the effect of the SfiA inhibitor, could not restore a normal 
morphology to hupA hupB mutant bacteria. The LexA repressor, which controls the 
expression of the sfiA gene, was present in hupA hupB mutant bacteria in 
concentrations half of those of the parent bacteria, but this decrease was 
independent of the specific cleavage of the LexA repressor by activated RecA 
protein. One possibility to account for the filamentous morphology of hupA hupB 
mutant bacteria is that the lack of HU protein alters the expression of specific 
genes, such as lexA and fts cell division genes.

DNA recombination and repair in Wolbachia: RecA and related proteins.

Paul, MN, 55108, USA. fallo002@umn.edu.

Wolbachia is an obligate intracellular bacterium that has undergone extensive 
genomic streamlining in its arthropod and nematode hosts. Because the gene 
encoding the bacterial DNA recombination/repair protein RecA is not essential in 
Escherichia coli, abundant expression of this protein in a mosquito cell line 
persistently infected with Wolbachia strain wStri was unexpected. However, 
RecA's role in the lytic cycle of bacteriophage lambda provides an explanation 
for retention of recA in strains known to encode lambda-like WO prophages. To 
examine DNA recombination/repair capacities in Wolbachia, a systematic 
examination of RecA and related proteins in complete or nearly complete 
Wolbachia genomes from supergroups A, B, C, D, E, F, J and S was undertaken. 
Genes encoding proteins including RecA, RecF, RecO, RecR, RecG and Holliday 
junction resolvases RuvA, RuvB and RuvC are uniformly absent from Wolbachia in 
supergroup C and have reduced representation in supergroups D and J, suggesting 
that recombination and repair activities are compromised in nematode-associated 
Wolbachia, relative to strains that infect arthropods. An exception is filarial 
Wolbachia strain wMhie, assigned to supergroup F, which occurs in a nematode 
host from a poikilothermic lizard. Genes encoding LexA and error-prone 
polymerases are absent from all Wolbachia genomes, suggesting that the SOS 
functions induced by RecA-mediated activation of LexA do not occur, despite 
retention of genes encoding a few proteins that respond to LexA induction in E. 
coli. Three independent E. coli accessions converge on a single Wolbachia UvrD 
helicase, which interacts with mismatch repair proteins MutS and MutL, encoded 
in nearly all Wolbachia genomes. With the exception of MutL, which has been 
mapped to a eukaryotic association module in Phage WO, proteins involved in 
recombination/repair are uniformly represented by single protein annotations. 
Putative phage-encoded MutL proteins are restricted to Wolbachia supergroups A 
and B and show higher amino acid identity than chromosomally encoded MutL 
orthologs. This analysis underscores differences between nematode and 
arthropod-associated Wolbachia and describes aspects of DNA metabolism that 
potentially impact development of procedures for transformation and genetic 
manipulation of Wolbachia.

Cyanobacteria are fascinating photosynthetic prokaryotes that are regarded as 
the ancestors of the plant chloroplast; the purveyors of oxygen and biomass for 
the food chain; and promising cell factories for an environmentally friendly 
production of chemicals. In colonizing most waters and soils of our planet, 
cyanobacteria are inevitably challenged by environmental stresses that generate 
DNA damages. Furthermore, many strains engineered for biotechnological purposes 
can use DNA recombination to stop synthesizing the biotechnological product. 
Hence, it is important to study DNA recombination and repair in cyanobacteria 
for both basic and applied research. This review reports what is known in a few 
widely studied model cyanobacteria and what can be inferred by mining the 
sequenced genomes of morphologically and physiologically diverse strains. We 
show that cyanobacteria possess many E. coli-like DNA recombination and repair 
genes, and possibly other genes not yet identified. E. coli-homolog genes are 
unevenly distributed in cyanobacteria, in agreement with their wide genome 
diversity. Many genes are extremely well conserved in cyanobacteria (mutMS, 
radA, recA, recFO, recG, recN, ruvABC, ssb, and uvrABCD), even in small genomes, 
suggesting that they encode the core DNA repair process. In addition to these 
core genes, the marine Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus strains harbor recBCD 
(DNA recombination), umuCD (mutational DNA replication), as well as the key SOS 
genes lexA (regulation of the SOS system) and sulA (postponing of cell division 
until completion of DNA reparation). Hence, these strains could possess an E. 
coli-type SOS system. In contrast, several cyanobacteria endowed with larger 
genomes lack typical SOS genes. For examples, the two studied Gloeobacter 
strains lack alkB, lexA, and sulA; and Synechococcus PCC7942 has neither lexA 
nor recCD. Furthermore, the Synechocystis PCC6803 lexA product does not regulate 
DNA repair genes. Collectively, these findings indicate that not all 
cyanobacteria have an E. coli-type SOS system. Also interestingly, several 
cyanobacteria possess multiple copies of E. coli-like DNA repair genes, such as 
Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017 (2 alkB, 3 ogt, 7 recA, 3 recD, 2 ssb, 3 umuC, 4 
umuD, and 8 xerC), Cyanothece ATCC51142 (2 lexA and 4 ruvC), and Nostoc PCC7120

A role for topoisomerase III in a recombination pathway alternative to RuvABC.

Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

The physiological role of topoisomerase III is unclear for any organism. We show 
here that the removal of topoisomerase III in temperature sensitive 
topoisomerase IV mutants in Escherichia coli results in inviability at the 
permissive temperature. The removal of topoisomerase III has no effect on the 
accumulation of catenated intermediates of DNA replication, even when 
topoisomerase IV activity is removed. Either recQ or recA null mutations, but 
not helD null or lexA3, partially rescued the synthetic lethality of the double 
topoisomerase III/IV mutant, indicating a role for topoisomerase III in 
recombination. We find a bias against deleting the gene encoding topoisomerase 
III in ruvC53 or DeltaruvABC backgrounds compared with the isogenic wild-type 
strains. The topoisomerase III RuvC double mutants that can be constructed are 
five- to 10-fold more sensitive to UV irradiation and mitomycin C treatment and 
are twofold less efficient in transduction efficiency than ruvC53 mutants. The 
overexpression of ruvABC allows the construction of the topoisomerase III/IV 
double mutant. These data are consistent with a role for topoisomerase III in 
disentangling recombination intermediates as an alternative to RuvABC to 
maintain the stability of the genome.

Mistranslation induced by streptomycin provokes a RecABC/RuvABC-dependent 
mutator phenotype in Escherichia coli cells.

Balashov S(1), Humayun MZ.

School, 185 South Orange Avenue, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.

Translational stress-induced mutagenesis (TSM) refers to the mutator phenotype 
observed in Escherichia coli cells expressing a mutant allele (mutA or mutC) of 
the glycine tRNA gene glyV (or glyW). Because of an anticodon mutation, 
expression of the mutA allele results in low levels of Asp-->Gly mistranslation. 
The mutA phenotype does not require lexA-regulated SOS mutagenesis functions, 
and appears to be suppressed in cells defective for RecABC-dependent homologous 
recombination functions. To test the hypothesis that the TSM response is 
mediated by non-specific mistranslation rather than specific Asp-->Gly 
misreading, we asked if streptomycin (Str), an aminoglycoside antibiotic known 
to promote mistranslation, can provoke a mutator phenotype. We report that Str 
induces a strong mutator phenotype in cells bearing certain alleles of rpsL, the 
gene encoding S12, an essential component of the ribosomal 30 S subunit. The 
phenotype is strikingly similar to that observed in mutA cells in its mutational 
specificity, as well as in its requirement for RecABC-mediated homologous 
recombination functions. Expression of Str-inducible mutator phenotype 
correlates with mistranslation efficiency in response to Str. Thus, 
mistranslation in general is able to induce the TSM response. The Str-inducible 
mutator phenotype described here defines a new functional class of rpsL alleles, 
and raises interesting questions on the mechanism of action of Str, and on 
bacterial response to antibiotic stress.

Identification of some DNA damage-inducible genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: 
apparent lack of correlation with LexA binding.

The repair of DNA damage is expected to be particularly important to 
intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and so it is of 
interest to examine the response of M. tuberculosis to DNA damage. The 
expression of recA, a key component in DNA repair and recombination, is induced 
by DNA damage in M. tuberculosis. In this study, we have analyzed the expression 
following DNA damage in M. tuberculosis of a number of other genes which are DNA 
damage inducible in Escherichia coli. While many of these genes were also 
induced by DNA damage in M. tuberculosis, some were not. In addition, one gene 
(ruvC) which is not induced by DNA damage in E. coli was induced in M. 
tuberculosis, a result likely linked to its different transcriptional 
arrangement in M. tuberculosis. We also searched the sequences upstream of the 
genes being studied for the mycobacterial SOS box (the binding site for LexA) 
and assessed LexA binding to potential sites identified. LexA is the repressor 
protein responsible for regulating expression of these SOS genes in E. coli. 
However, two of the genes which were DNA damage inducible in M. tuberculosis did 
not have identifiable sites to which LexA bound. The absence of binding sites 
for LexA upstream of these genes was confirmed by analysis of LexA binding to 
overlapping DNA fragments covering a region from 500 bp upstream of the coding 
sequence to 100 bp within it. Therefore, it appears most likely that an 
alternative mechanism of gene regulation in response to DNA damage exists in M. 
tuberculosis.

Recombination is essential for viability of an Escherichia coli dam (DNA adenine 
methyltransferase) mutant.

Double mutants of Escherichia coli dam (DNA adenine methyltransferase) strains 
with ruvA, ruvB, or ruvC could not be constructed, whereas dam derivatives with 
recD, recF, recJ, and recR were viable. The ruv gene products are required for 
Holliday junction translocation and resolution of recombination intermediates. A 
dam recG (Holliday junction translocation) mutant strain was isolated but at a 
very much lower frequency than expected. The inviability of a dam lexA (Ind(-)) 
host was abrogated by the simultaneous presence of plasmids encoding both recA 
and ruvAB. This result indicates that of more than 20 SOS genes, only recA and 
ruvAB need to be derepressed to allow for dam mutant survival. The presence of 
mutS or mutL mutations allowed the construction of dam lexA (Ind(-)) 
derivatives. The requirement for recA, recB, recC, ruvA, ruvB, ruvC, and 
possibly recG gene expression indicates that recombination is essential for 
viability of dam bacteria probably to repair DNA double-strand breaks. The 
effect of mutS and mutL mutations indicates that DNA mismatch repair is the 
ultimate source of most of these DNA breaks. The requirement for recombination 
also suggests an explanation for the sensitivity of dam cells to certain 
DNA-damaging agents.

The ultraviolet-sensitizing function of plasmid R391 interferes with a late step 
of postreplication repair in Escherichia coli.

Technology, Kwei-San, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.

The conjugative plasmid R391 increases the UV radiation sensitivity of 
wild-type, uvrA, and lexA cells of Escherichia coli, but not recA strains. To 
investigate the UV-sensitizing function of R391, we examined the effect of R391 
on the repair of DNA daughter-strand gaps and on the UV radiation sensitivities 
of various repair and/or recombination-deficient mutants. The presence of R391 
did not significantly inhibit the repair of DNA daughter-strand gaps in uvrB 
cells. The presence of R391 increased the UV radiation sensitivity of uvrA, uvrA 
recF, uvrB, uvrB recF, uvrB recB, and uvrB ssb-113 cells to UV irradiation, but 
did not significantly increase the UV radiation sensitivity of uvrA ruvA and 
uvrA ruvC strains. Based on these results, we propose that the UV-sensitizing 
activity of R391 acts by inhibiting or interfering with the ruvABC-mediated 
postsynapsis step of recombinational repair.

Bacteria provide a simple system for the genetic analysis of homologous 
recombination. More than twenty genes have been identified in Escherichia coli. 
The enzymatic activities associated with the products of many of these genes 
have been revealed by studies with model DNA substrates. It is now possible to 
pair homologous molecules in vitro and process these through defined 
intermediates into mature recombinants of the types predicted by genetic 
crosses.

Resolution of Holliday junctions in Escherichia coli: identification of the ruvC

The ruvC gene of Escherichia coli specifies a nuclease that resolves Holliday 
junction intermediates in genetic recombination (B. Connolly, C.A. Parsons, F.E. 
Benson, H.J. Dunderdale, G.J. Sharples, R.G. Lloyd, and S.C. West, Proc. Natl. 
Acad, Sci. USA 88:6063-6067, 1991). The gene was located between aspS and the 
ruvAB operon by DNA sequencing and deletion analysis of ruvC plasmids and was 
shown to encode a protein of 18,747 Da. Analysis of the DNA flanking ruvC 
indicated that the gene is transcribed independently of the LexA-regulated ruvAB 
operon and is not under direct SOS control. ruvC lies downstream of an open 
reading frame, orf-33, for a protein which migrates during sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a 33-kDa polypeptide. These two 
genes probably form an operon. However, expression of ruvC was found to be very 
poor relative to that of orf-33. A double ribosomal frameshift between these 
genes is proposed as a possible reason for the low level of RuvC. Two further 
open reading frames of unknown function were identified, one on either side of 
the orf-33-ruvC operon.

Many recombination, DNA repair and DNA replication mutants have high basal 
levels of SOS expression as determined by a sulAp-lacZ reporter gene system on a 
population of cells. Two opposing models to explain how the SOS expression is 
distributed in these cells are: (i) the 'Uniform Expression Model (UEM)' where 
expression is evenly distributed in all cells or (ii) the 'Two Population Model 
(TPM)' where some cells are highly induced while others are not at all. To 
distinguish between these two models, a method to quantify SOS expression in 
individual bacterial cells was developed by fusing an SOS promoter (sulAp) to 
the green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter gene and inserting it at attlambda 
on the Escherichia coli chromosome. It is shown that the fluorescence in 
sulAp-gfp cells is regulated by RecA and LexA. This system was then used to 
distinguish between the two models for several mutants. The patterns displayed 
by priA, dnaT, recG, uvrD, dam, ftsK, rnhA, polA and xerC mutants were explained 
best by the TPM while only lexA (def), lexA3 (ind-) and recA defective mutants 
were explained best by the UEM. These results are discussed in a context of how 
the processes of DNA replication and recombination may affect cells in a 
population differentially.

Collisions between DNA replication complexes (replisomes) and impediments such 
as damaged DNA or proteins tightly bound to the chromosome lead to premature 
dissociation of replisomes at least once per cell cycle in Escherichia coli. 
Left unrepaired, these events produce incompletely replicated chromosomes that 
cannot be properly partitioned into daughter cells. DNA replication restart, the 
process that reloads replisomes at prematurely terminated sites, is therefore 
essential in E. coli and other bacteria. Three replication restart pathways have 
been identified in E. coli: PriA/PriB, PriA/PriC, and PriC/Rep. A limited number 
of genetic interactions between replication restart and other genome maintenance 
pathways have been defined, but a systematic study placing replication restart 
reactions in a broader cellular context has not been performed. We have utilized 
transposon-insertion sequencing to identify new genetic interactions between DNA 
replication restart pathways and other cellular systems. Known genetic 
interactors with the priB replication restart gene (uniquely involved in the 
PriA/PriB pathway) were confirmed and several novel priB interactions were 
discovered. Targeted genetic and imaging-based experiments with priB and its 
genetic partners revealed significant double-strand DNA break accumulation in 
strains with mutations in dam, rep, rdgC, lexA, or polA. Modulating the activity 
of the RecA recombinase partially suppressed the detrimental effects of rdgC or 
lexA mutations in ΔpriB cells. Taken together, our results highlight roles for

Engineering microbial hosts for the production of fungible fuels requires 
mitigation of limitations posed on the production capacity. One such limitation 
arises from the inherent toxicity of solvent-like biofuel compounds to 
production strains, such as Escherichia coli. Here we show the importance of 
host engineering for the production of short-chain alcohols by studying the 
overexpression of genes upregulated in response to exogenous isopentenol. Using 
systems biology data, we selected 40 genes that were upregulated following 
isopentenol exposure and subsequently overexpressed them in E. coli. 
Overexpression of several of these candidates improved tolerance to exogenously 
added isopentenol. Genes conferring isopentenol tolerance phenotypes belonged to 
diverse functional groups, such as oxidative stress response (soxS, fpr, and 
nrdH), general stress response (metR, yqhD, and gidB), heat shock-related 
response (ibpA), and transport (mdlB). To determine if these genes could also 
improve isopentenol production, we coexpressed the tolerance-enhancing genes 
individually with an isopentenol production pathway. Our data show that 
expression of 6 of the 8 candidates improved the production of isopentenol in E. 
coli, with the methionine biosynthesis regulator MetR improving the titer for 
isopentenol production by 55%. Additionally, expression of MdlB, an ABC 
transporter, facilitated a 12% improvement in isopentenol production. To our 
knowledge, MdlB is the first example of a transporter that can be used to 
improve production of a short-chain alcohol and provides a valuable new avenue 
for host engineering in biogasoline production.
IMPORTANCE: The use of microbial host platforms for the production of bulk 
commodities, such as chemicals and fuels, is now a focus of many biotechnology 
efforts. Many of these compounds are inherently toxic to the host microbe, which 
in turn places a limit on production despite efforts to optimize the 
bioconversion pathways. In order to achieve economically viable production 
levels, it is also necessary to engineer production strains with improved 
tolerance to these compounds. We demonstrate that microbial tolerance 
engineering using transcriptomics data can also identify targets that improve 
production. Our results include an exporter and a methionine biosynthesis 
regulator that improve isopentenol production, providing a starting point to 
further engineer the host for biogasoline production.

Iron plays a central role at the interface of pathogen and host. The ability to 
sequester iron from a host not only reduces host immune defenses but also 
promotes pathogen virulence, leading to the occurrence of infectious disease. 
Recently, outer membrane protein OmpW was shown to protect bacteria against 
harsh environmental conditions and to play a role in infectious disease. The 
expression of this versatile protein is controlled by iron, but the underlying 
mechanism of iron regulation has not been elucidated. In this study, the 
relation between OmpW expression and iron was investigated. Our results 
demonstrated that expression of OmpW is responsive to iron. Iron uptake analysis 
showed that an ompW mutant strain has a strong requirement for iron as compared 
to wild type and the ompW complemented strain. Moreover, ferric uptake 
regulation protein Fur, an iron binding transcriptional factor, was 
downregulated under iron limitation conditions and had a similar expression 
profile to OmpW in the presence or absence of iron. Based on these results, we 
suggest that iron regulates OmpW by binding to Fur. Furthermore, SoxS, a 
transcriptional factor involved in oxidative stress, was found to negatively 
regulate OmpW. We found that downregulating or knocking out OmpW results in 
bacterial resistance to oxidative stress. These findings provide new insight 
into the regulation of OmpW expression by iron, and may represent a new 
mechanism contributing to iron-mediated infectious disease.

The two-component signal transduction system CpxAR is especially widespread in 
Gram-negative bacteria. It has been reported that CpxAR contributes to the 
multidrug resistance (MDR) in Escherichia coli. CpxR is a response regulator in 
the two-component CpxAR system. The aim of this study was to explore the role of 
cpxR in the MDR of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The minimal inhibitory 
concentrations (MICs) of various antibiotics commonly used in veterinary 
medicine for strains JS (a multidrug-susceptible standard strain of S. enterica 
serovar Typhimurium), JSΔcpxR, JSΔcpxR/pcpxR, JSΔcpxR/pcpxR (*), JSΔcpxRΔacrB, 
JSΔcpxRΔacrB/pcpxR, JSΔcpxRΔacrB/pcpxR (*), 9 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 
isolates (SH1-9), and SH1-9ΔcpxR were determined by the 2-fold broth 
microdilution method. The relative mRNA expression levels of ompF, ompC, ompW, 
ompD, tolC, acrB, acrD, acrF, mdtA, marA, and soxS in strains JS, JSΔcpxR, and 
JSΔcpxR/pcpxR were detected by real-time PCR. The results showed 2- to 4-fold 
decreases in the MICs of amikacin (AMK), gentamycin (GEN), apramycin (APR), 
neomycin (NEO), ceftriaxone (CRO), ceftiofur (CEF), and cefquinome (CEQ) for 
strain JSΔcpxR, as compared to those for the parental strain JS. Likewise, 
SH1-9ΔcpxR were found to have 2- to 8-fold reduction in resistance to the above 
antibiotics, except for NEO, as compared to their parental strains SH1-9. 
Furthermore, 2- to 4-fold further decreases in the MICs of AMK, GEN, APR, and 
CEF for strain JSΔcpxRΔacrB were observed, as compared to those for strain 
JSΔacrB. In addition, CpxR overproduction in strain JSΔcpxR led to significant 
decreases in the mRNA expression levels of ompF, ompC, ompW, ompD, tolC, acrB, 
marA, and soxS, and significant increases in those of stm3031 and stm1530. 
Notably, after all strains were induced simultaneously by GEN to the 15th 
passage at subinhibitory concentrations, strain JSΔcpxR/pcpxR showed significant 
increases in mRNA expression levels of the efflux pump acrD and mdtA genes, as 
compared to strain JSΔcpxR. Our results indicate that the two-component 
regulator CpxR contributes to resistance of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium to 
aminoglycosides and β-lactams by influencing the expression level of the 
MDR-related genes.

Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, 136

OBJECTIVES: Multidrug efflux pumps mediate resistance to antibiotics and other 
toxic compounds. We studied the role of AcrAB-TolC, the main efflux pump in 
Escherichia coli, in regulating gene expression.
METHODS: Deletion mutants, an acrABp-lacZ fusion and reverse 
transcription-real-time quantitative PCR experiments were used to study the role 
of AcrAB-TolC and metabolism in regulating gene expression of the acrAB operon 
and its transcriptional regulators.
RESULTS: Deletion of the acrB gene increased the expression of the acrAB operon. 
A similar induction of acrAB was found when acrA or tolC was deleted, and when 
the pump function was inhibited using phenylalanine-arginine-β-naphthylamide. 
The induction of acrAB in the ΔacrB strain was totally (AcrR or SoxS) or 
partially (SoxR or MarA) prevented when the genes for these acrAB regulators 
were also deleted. The expression of soxS and marA, but not of acrR, was 
increased in the ΔacrB strain, which also showed altered expression of many 
other genes related to different cellular processes, including motility. 
Deletion of the metabolic genes entA and entE (enterobactin biosysnthesis), glpX 
(gluconeogenesis), cysH (cysteine biosynthesis) and purA (purine biosynthesis) 
also prevented activation of the acrAB promoter in the ΔacrB strain. Addition of 
the enterobactin biosynthesis intermediate metabolite 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate 
induced the expression of acrAB.
CONCLUSIONS: These results together suggest a model in which the AcrAB-TolC pump 
effluxes cellular metabolites that are toxic and/or have a signalling role. If 
the pump is inactivated or inhibited, these metabolites would accumulate, 
inactivating AcrR and/or up-regulating soxS and marA expression, ultimately 
triggering the up-regulation of acrAB expression to restore homeostasis.

The D-allose operon of Escherichia coli K-12.

Technology, Taejon.

Escherichia coli K-12 can utilize D-allose, an all-cis hexose, as a sole carbon 
source. The operon responsible for D-allose metabolism was localized at 92.8 min 
of the E. coli linkage map. It consists of six genes, alsRBACEK, which are 
inducible by D-allose and are under the control of the repressor gene alsR. This 
operon is also subject to catabolite repression. Three genes, alsB, alsA, and 
alsC, appear to be necessary for transport of D-allose. D-Allose-binding 
protein, encoded by alsB, is a periplasmic protein that has an affinity for 
D-allose, with a Kd of 0.33 microM. As was found for other 
binding-protein-mediated ABC transporters, the allose transport system includes 
an ATP-binding component (AlsA) and a transmembrane protein (AlsC). It was found 
that AlsE (a putative D-allulose-6-phosphate 3-epimerase), but not AlsK (a 
putative D-allose kinase), is necessary for allose metabolism. During this 
study, we observed that the D-allose transporter is partially responsible for 
the low-affinity transport of D-ribose and that strain W3110, an E. coli 
prototroph, has a defect in the transport of D-allose mediated by the allose 
permease.

Novel members of the two-component signal transduction genes in Escherichia 
coli.

University, Aichi.

A variety of adaptive response systems in prokaryotes often involve two families 
(two components) of signal transduction proteins, namely, sensory kinases and 
response-regulators. To extend the list of such sensor/regulator genes for 
Escherichia coli, we adopted a random screening method in this study. In 
particular, we isolated a series of recombinant plasmids that are able 
phenotypically to suppress mutational lesions of both the envZ and phoR/creC 
genes, each of which encodes a well-characterized sensory-kinase. Among the 
recombinant plasmids thus isolated, two clones (named pSN11 and pSN25) were 
subjected to characterization in detail. These analyses allowed us to identify 
the genetic loci specifying novel members of the sensor/regulator families. One 
(pSN11) is located around 45 min on the E. coli genetic map, that contains two 
adjacent coding-sequences (baeS and baeR). The other (pSN25) is located around 
93 min of the genetic map, that also comprises two adjacent coding-sequences 
(basS and basR). These two pairs of gene-products, thus newly identified, were 
revealed to belong to typical members of the sensor/regulator families. 
Furthermore, they were demonstrated to exhibit the in vitro phosphotransfer 
reaction in the presence of ATP, that is also a characteristic of the 
sensory-kinase and response-regulator proteins.

Research, Osaka University, Ibaraki, Osaka 567-0047, Japan.

OBJECTIVES: In Escherichia coli, there are 32 open reading frames assumed, on 
the basis of sequence similarities, to be response regulator genes of 
two-component signal transduction systems. We cloned all 32 response regulators 
and examined whether or not response regulator-overexpressing cells confer 
resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in E. coli.
METHODS: E. coli KAM3 (acrB), a drug-hypersusceptible mutant, was used as a host 
strain for the overproduction of response regulators. MICs were determined by 
the agar dilution method.
RESULTS: Thirteen response regulators out of 32 genes, namely baeR, cheY, cpxR, 
creB, evgA, fimZ, narL, ompR, rcsB, rstA, yedW, yehT and dcuR, conferred 
increased beta-lactam resistance. Among them, overexpression of baeR, evgA, rcsB 
and dcuR conferred high-level resistance. The baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance 
is due to up-regulation of the expression of multidrug exporter genes, acrD and 
mdtABC for baeR, and yhiUV for evgA, because baeR- and evgA-mediated resistance 
was completely absent in strains lacking these exporter genes. The fimZ-mediated 
cefalothin resistance is due to the chromosomal ampC gene, because the ampC 
deletion strain did not show fimZ-mediated resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-component signal transduction systems contribute to beta-lactam 
resistance in E. coli. Multidrug exporters play roles in two-component signal 
transduction system-mediated beta-lactam resistance.

SigmaE regulates and is regulated by a small RNA in Escherichia coli.

Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

RybB is a small, Hfq-binding noncoding RNA originally identified in a screen of 
conserved intergenic regions in Escherichia coli. Fusions of the rybB promoter 
to lacZ were used to screen plasmid genomic libraries and genomic transposon 
mutants for regulators of rybB expression. A number of plasmids, including some 
carrying rybB, negatively regulated the fusion. An insertion in the rep helicase 
and one upstream of dnaK decreased expression of the fusion. Multicopy 
suppressors of these insertions led to identification of two plasmids that 
stimulated the fusion. One contained the gene for the response regulator OmpR; 
the second contained mipA, encoding a murein hydrolase. The involvement of MipA 
and OmpR in cell surface synthesis suggested that the rybB promoter might be 
dependent on sigma(E). The sequence upstream of the +1 of rybB contains a 
consensus sigma(E) promoter. The activity of rybB-lacZ was increased in cells 
lacking the RseA anti-sigma factor and when sigma(E) was overproduced from a 
heterologous promoter. The activity of rybB-lacZ and the detection of RybB were 
totally abolished in an rpoE-null strain. In vitro, sigma(E) efficiently 
transcribes from this promoter. Both a rybB mutation and an hfq mutation 
significantly increased expression of both rybB-lacZ and rpoE-lacZ fusions, 
consistent with negative regulation of the sigma(E) response by RybB and other 
small RNAs. Based on the plasmid screens, NsrR, a repressor sensitive to nitric 
oxide, was also found to negatively regulate sigma(E)-dependent promoters in an 
RseA-independent fashion.

NsrR-dependent method for detecting nitric oxide accumulation in the Escherichia 
coli cytoplasm and enzymes involved in NO production.

Vine CE(1), Purewal SK, Cole JA.

Author information:
(1)School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.

A β-galactosidase assay for detecting the accumulation of NO in the Escherichia 
coli cytoplasm has been developed based on the sensitive response of the 
transcription repressor, NsrR, to NO. The hcp promoter is repressed by NsrR in 
the absence of nitric oxide, but repression is relieved when NO accumulates in 
the cytoplasm. Most, but not all, of this NO is formed by the interaction of the 
membrane-associated nitrate reductase, NarG, with nitrite. External NO at 
physiologically relevant concentrations does not equilibrate across the E. coli 
membrane with NsrR in the cytoplasm. The periplasmic nitrite reductase, NrfAB, 
is not required to prevent equilibration of NO across the membrane. External NO 
supplied at the highest concentration reported to occur in vivo does not damage 
FNR sufficiently to affect transcription from the hcp or hmp promoters or from a 
synthetic promoter. We suggest that the capacity of E. coli to reduce NO is 
sufficient to prevent its accumulation from external sources in the cytoplasm.

Nitric oxide homeostasis in Salmonella typhimurium: roles of respiratory nitrate 
reductase and flavohemoglobin.

Gilberthorpe NJ(1), Poole RK.

Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, United Kingdom.

Nitric oxide (NO) is generated in biological systems primarily via the activity 
of NO synthases and nitrate and nitrite reductases. Here we show that Salmonella 
enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) grown anaerobically with nitrate 
is capable of generating polarographically detectable NO after nitrite 
(NO(2)(-)) addition. NO accumulation is sensitive to the NO scavenger 
2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide. Neither an 
fnr mutant nor an fnr hmp double mutant produces NO, indicating the involvement 
in NO evolution from NO(2)(-) of protein(s) positively regulated by FNR. 
Contrary to previous findings in Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that neither 
the periplasmic nitrite reductase (NrfA) nor the cytoplasmic nitrite reductase 
(NirB) is involved in NO production in S. typhimurium. However, mutant cells 
lacking the membrane-bound nitrate reductase, NarGHI, and membranes derived from 
these cells are unable to produce NO, demonstrating that, in wild-type S. 
typhimurium, this enzyme is responsible for NO production. Membrane terminal 
oxidases cannot account for the NO levels measured. The nitrate reductase 
inhibitor, azide, abrogates NO evolution by Salmonella, and production of NO 
occurs only in the absence from the assays of nitrate; both features reveal a 
marked similarity between the NO-generating activities of this bacterium and 
plants. Unlike the situation in E. coli, an S. typhimurium hmp mutant produces 
NO both aerobically and anaerobically. Under aerobic conditions, when a 
functional flavohemoglobin is present, no NO is detectable. We propose a 
homeostatic mechanism in S. typhimurium, in which NO produced from NO(2)(-) by 
nitrate reductase derepresses Hmp expression (via FNR and NsrR) and NorV 
expression (via NorR) and thus limits NO toxicity.

Novel two-component transmembrane transcription control: regulation of iron 
dicitrate transport in Escherichia coli K-12.

Van Hove B(1), Staudenmaier H, Braun V.

Author information:
(1)Mikrobiologie II, Universität Tübingen, Federal Republic of Germany.

Citrate and iron have to enter only the periplasmic space in order to induce the 
citrate-dependent iron(III) transport system of Escherichia coli. The five 
transport genes fecABCDE form an operon and are transcribed from fecA to fecE. 
Two genes, termed fecI and fecR, that mediate induction by iron(III) dicitrate 
have been identified upstream of fecA. The fecI gene encodes a protein of 173 
amino acids (molecular weight, 19,478); the fecR gene encodes a protein of 317 
amino acids (molecular weight, 35,529). Chromosomal fecI::Mu d1 mutants were 
unable to grow with iron(III) dicitrate as the sole iron source and synthesized 
no FecA outer membrane receptor protein. Growth was restored by transformation 
with plasmids encoding fecI or fecI and fecR. FecA and beta-galactosidase 
syntheses under transcription control of the fecB gene (fecB::Mu d1) were 
constitutive in fecI transformants and were regulated by iron(III) dicitrate in 
fecI fecR transformants. The amino acid sequence of the FecI protein contains a 
region close to the carboxy-terminal end for which a helix-turn-helix motif is 
predicted, which is typical for DNA-binding regulatory proteins. The FecI 
protein was found in the membrane, and the FecR protein was found in the 
periplasmic fraction. It is proposed that the FecR protein is the sensor that 
recognizes iron(III) dicitrate in the periplasm. The FecI protein activates fec 
gene expression by binding to the fec operator region. In the absence of 
citrate, FecR inactivates FecI. The lack of sequence homologies to other 
transmembrane signaling proteins and the location of the two proteins suggest a 
new type of transmembrane control mechanism.

Functional interaction of region 4 of the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor 
FecI with the cytoplasmic portion of the FecR transmembrane protein of the 
Escherichia coli ferric citrate transport system.

Germany.

Transcriptional regulation of the ferric citrate transport genes of Escherichia 
coli is initiated by the binding of ferric citrate to the outer membrane protein 
FecA. This binding elicits a signal that is transmitted by FecR across the 
cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the sigma factor FecI directs the 
RNA polymerase to the promoter upstream of the fecABCDE genes. An in vivo 
deletion analysis using a bacterial two-hybrid system assigned the interaction 
of the FecR and FecI proteins to the cytoplasmic portion of the FecR 
transmembrane protein and region 4 of FecI. Missense mutations randomly 
generated by PCR were localized to region 4 of FecI, and the mutants were 
impaired with regard to the interaction of FecR with FecI and fecB-lacZ 
transcription. The cloned region 4 of FecI interfered with fecB-lacZ 
transcription. Interaction of N-proximal regions of predicted FecR homologs with 
region 4 of predicted FecI homologs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was demonstrated. 
The interaction was specific in that only cognate protein pairs interacted with 
each other; no interactions occurred between heterologous combinations of the P. 
aeruginosa proteins and between a P. aeruginosa FecI homolog and E. coli FecR. 
The results demonstrate that region 4 of FecI specifically binds FecR and that 
this binding is necessary for FecI to function as a sigma factor.

Transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes is initiated by binding of 
ferric citrate to the FecA protein in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli 
K-12. Bound ferric citrate does not have to be transported but initiates a 
signal that is transmitted by FecA across the outer membrane and by FecR across 
the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the FecI 
extracytoplasmic-function (ECF) sigma factor becomes active. In this study, we 
isolated transcription initiation-negative missense mutants in the cytoplasmic 
region of FecR that were located at four sites, L13Q, W19R, W39R, and W50R, 
which are highly conserved in FecR-like open reading frames of the Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, 
and Caulobacter crescentus genomes. The cytoplasmic portion of the FecR mutant 
proteins, FecR(1-85), did not interact with wild-type FecI, in contrast to 
wild-type FecR(1-85), which induced FecI-mediated fecB transport gene 
transcription. Two missense mutations in region 2.1 of FecI, S15A and H20E, 
partially restored induction of ferric citrate transport gene induction of the 
fecR mutants by ferric citrate. Region 2.1 of sigma(70) is thought to bind RNA 
polymerase core enzyme; the residual activity of mutated FecI in the absence of 
FecR, however, was not higher than that of wild-type FecI. In addition, missense 
mutations in the fecI promoter region resulted in a twofold increased 
transcription in fecR wild-type cells and a partial restoration of fec transport 
gene transcription in the fecR mutants. The mutations reduced binding of the 
Fe(2+) Fur repressor and as a consequence enhanced fecI transcription. The data 
reveal properties of the FecI ECF factor distinct from those of sigma(70) and 
further support the novel transcription initiation model in which the 
cytoplasmic portion of FecR is important for FecI activity.

SigX of Bacillus subtilis replaces the ECF sigma factor fecI of Escherichia coli 
and is inhibited by RsiX.

Brutsche S(1), Braun V.

Author information:

Analysis of the Bacillus subtilis genome sequence revealed two open reading 
frames, designated sigX and ypuN (now termed rsiX), that are homologous to fecI 
and fecR, respectively, of Escherichia coli. fecI encodes a sigma 70-type factor 
that is necessary for transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes 
fecABCDE. fecR encodes a cytoplasmic transmembrane protein that is required for 
the induction of fec transport gene transcription by ferric citrate binding to 
the FecA outer membrane receptor protein. Investigation of the SigX and RsiX 
activities disclosed that they are not involved in ferric citrate 
utilization--since ferric citrate did not serve as an iron source for B. 
subtilis SG64--or in the regulation of any other ferric siderophore transport 
system tested. Strains deleted for sigX or rsiX displayed no phenotype under 
aerobic or anoxic conditions. However, cloned sigX complemented an E. coli fecI 
mutant, and the Fur box upstream of sigX responded to the E. coli iron 
regulatory protein Fur. The purified SigX protein was required for in vitro 
transcription of a sigX-containing DNA fragment by the E. coli RNA polymerase 
core enzyme. Autoregulation of sigX was also found in vivo using a sigX'-lacZ 
gene fusion. RsiX inhibited SigX activity in vivo and in vitro and stabilized 
the SigX protein. RsiX was localized in the membrane fraction. When RsiX is 
present, SigX is found in the membrane fraction; in the absence of RsiX, some 
SigX is detectable in the cytoplasm. We conclude that SigX is a sigma factor 
that belongs to the ECF (extracytoplasmic function) sigma 70-factor family. It 
is not known which promoters are recognized by SigX in B. subtilis. SigX may be 
involved in the regulation of iron metabolism, as evidenced by its activity in 
E. coli.

Surface signaling in transcriptional regulation of the ferric citrate transport 
system of Escherichia coli: mutational analysis of the alternative sigma factor 
FecI supports its essential role in fec transport gene transcription.

Ferric citrate induces transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes (fec) 
in escherichia coli by binding to the outer membrane receptor protein FecA 
without entering the cell. The signal elicited by ferric citrate crosses the 
outer membrane via TonB, ExbB, and ExbD. FecR transmits the signal across the 
cytoplasmic membrane and activates FecI located in the cytoplasm. FecI belongs 
to a subgroup of sigma factors that respond to extracytoplasmic stimuli. 
Chromosomal insertion and deletion mutations were generated in fecI; the 
resulting mutants were totally devoid of FecA production and fecB-lacZ 
expression. Iron starvation did not derepress fec transport gene transcription 
in fecI mutants. Missense point mutations were generated in the predicted 
helix-turn-helix motif of FecI to examine its role in transcription initiation. 
Replacement of glutamate by alanine (E141A) at the third position in the first 
helix reduced the residual activity of FecI in the absence of ferric citrate to 
30% of the wild-type level, but induced fec transcription almost normally n the 
presence of ferric citrate. Mutant FecI(K145E) displayed 156% of the activity of 
wild-type FecI in the absence of ferric citrate and conferred full induction by 
ferric citrate. Mutant FecI(K155E), which has a mutation in the second helix, 
showed 9% of the wild-type activity in the presence of ferric citrate and 78% in 
the absence of ferric citrate. The reduced activity of FecI(K155E) was also 
shown in vitro by DNA binding assays with cell lysates; in gel retardation 
experiments FecI(K155E) reduced the electrophoretic mobility of fecA 
promoter-containing DNA less than did wild-type FecI. fecI is not autoregulated, 
as demonstrated by the lack of FecI-induced fecI-lacZ expression in vivo and by 
the lack of specific fecI transcription in vitro. Instead, formation of fecI 
mRNA requires sigma 70. We conclude that transcription of the fec transport 
genes is regulated by FecI, which responds to ferric citrate via FecR. fecI and 
fecR co-transcription is inhibited by the iron-loaded Fur repressor, which then 
results in a low level of transcription of the fec transport genes.

Transcriptional regulation of ferric citrate transport in Escherichia coli K-12. 
Fecl belongs to a new subfamily of sigma 70-type factors that respond to 
extracytoplasmic stimuli.

Transcription of the ferric citrate transport system of Escherichia coli K-12 is 
repressed by Fe(2+)-Fur and activated by ferric citrate. Ferric citrate does not 
have to enter the cytoplasm; it initiates a signal transduction mechanism by 
binding to the outer membrane receptor FecA. Presumably, a conformational change 
is transmitted in a TonB-dependent manner to the FecR protein. FecR activates 
FecI, and FecI activates transcription of the fecABCDE transport genes. In this 
communication, FecI was isolated after cloning fecI downstream of an ideal 
ribosome-binding site. Overexpressed FecI formed inclusion bodies which were 
solubilized and purified in active form using a mild detergent. FecI, in 
conjunction with RNA polymerase core enzyme, directed transcription from the 
fecA promoter in an in vitro run-off transcription assay. Furthermore, FecI 
retarded the electrophoretic mobility of a specific 75 bp DNA fragment located 
upstream of fecA. An in vivo competition experiment between the fecA promoters 
of wild-type and mutant strains identified the nucleotide positions 2747, 2749, 
2751 and 2753, located within the 75 bp fragment, as important for FecI-induced 
transcription. Mobility band shift of fecA promoter DNA caused by cell lysates 
required growth of cells in the presence of ferric citrate and expression of 
FecA, FecI and FecR. These data support the previous assignment of FecI, based 
on sequence homologies, to a new subfamily of eubacterial RNA polymerase sigma 
70 factors that respond to extra-cytoplasmic stimuli and regulate 
extracytoplasmic functions.

Regulation of citrate-dependent iron transport of Escherichia coli: fecR is 
required for transcription activation by FecI.

Citrate-dependent Fe3+ transport into Escherichia coli K-12 is induced by iron 
and citrate. The inducer is probably ferric dicitrate which does not have to be 
taken up into the cytoplasm to induce transcription of the fec transport genes. 
Two regulatory genes, fecI and fecR, located upstream of the fecABCDE transport 
genes, are required for induction. We report that in vivo the chromosomally 
encoded FecI protein activates transcription of the fecA and fecB transport 
genes in response to ferric citrate and the FecR protein. Cells expressing 
chromosomally and plasmid-encoded truncated FecR derivatives no longer responded 
to ferric citrate and expressed the fec transport genes constitutively. The 
smallest active FecR derivative contained 59 amino acid residues as compared to 
the 317 residues of wild-type FecR. Constitutive induction was lower than 
induction of the FecR wild-type strain by ferric citrate. It is concluded that 
the N-terminal portion of FecR activates FecI and that the C-terminal portion of 
FecR responds to ferric citrate. Transcription of the fec transport genes is 
positively regulated by FecI and FecR and negatively regulated by the Fe2(+)-Fur 
repressor. Transcription activation and repression may occur independently of 
each other.

Novel two-component transmembrane transcription control: regulation of iron 
dicitrate transport in Escherichia coli K-12.

Citrate and iron have to enter only the periplasmic space in order to induce the 
citrate-dependent iron(III) transport system of Escherichia coli. The five 
transport genes fecABCDE form an operon and are transcribed from fecA to fecE. 
Two genes, termed fecI and fecR, that mediate induction by iron(III) dicitrate 
have been identified upstream of fecA. The fecI gene encodes a protein of 173 
amino acids (molecular weight, 19,478); the fecR gene encodes a protein of 317 
amino acids (molecular weight, 35,529). Chromosomal fecI::Mu d1 mutants were 
unable to grow with iron(III) dicitrate as the sole iron source and synthesized 
no FecA outer membrane receptor protein. Growth was restored by transformation 
with plasmids encoding fecI or fecI and fecR. FecA and beta-galactosidase 
syntheses under transcription control of the fecB gene (fecB::Mu d1) were 
constitutive in fecI transformants and were regulated by iron(III) dicitrate in 
fecI fecR transformants. The amino acid sequence of the FecI protein contains a 
region close to the carboxy-terminal end for which a helix-turn-helix motif is 
predicted, which is typical for DNA-binding regulatory proteins. The FecI 
protein was found in the membrane, and the FecR protein was found in the 
periplasmic fraction. It is proposed that the FecR protein is the sensor that 
recognizes iron(III) dicitrate in the periplasm. The FecI protein activates fec 
gene expression by binding to the fec operator region. In the absence of 
citrate, FecR inactivates FecI. The lack of sequence homologies to other 
transmembrane signaling proteins and the location of the two proteins suggest a 
new type of transmembrane control mechanism.

In Escherichia coli, citrate-mediated iron transport is a key nonheme pathway 
for the acquisition of iron. Binding of ferric citrate to the outer membrane 
protein FecA induces a signal cascade that ultimately activates the cytoplasmic 
sigma factor FecI, resulting in transcription of the fecABCDE ferric citrate 
transport genes. Central to this process is signal transduction mediated by the 
inner membrane protein FecR. FecR spans the inner membrane through a single 
transmembrane helix, which is flanked by cytoplasm- and periplasm-orientated 
moieties at the N and C termini. The transmembrane helix of FecR resembles a 
twin-arginine signal sequence, and the substitution of the paired arginine 
residues of the consensus motif decouples the FecR-FecI signal cascade, 
rendering the cells unable to activate transcription of the fec operon when 
grown on ferric citrate. Furthermore, the fusion of beta-lactamase C-terminal to 
the FecR transmembrane helix results in translocation of the C-terminal domain 
that is dependent on the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system. Our findings 
demonstrate that FecR belongs to a select group of bitopic inner membrane 
proteins that contain an internal twin-arginine signal sequence.IMPORTANCE Iron 
is essential for nearly all living organisms due to its role in metabolic 
processes and as a cofactor for many enzymes. The FecRI signal transduction 
pathway regulates citrate-mediated iron import in many Gram-negative bacteria, 
including Escherichia coli The interactions of FecR with the outer membrane 
protein FecA and cytoplasmic anti-sigma factor FecI have been extensively 
studied. However, the mechanism by which FecR inserts into the membrane has not 
previously been reported. In this study, we demonstrate that the targeting of 
FecR to the cytoplasmic membrane is dependent on the Tat system. As such, FecR 
represents a new class of bitopic Tat-dependent membrane proteins with an 
internal twin-arginine signal sequence.

The transcription initiation signal elicited by the binding of ferric citrate to 
the outer membrane FecA protein is transmitted by the FecR protein across the 
cytoplasmic membrane to the FecI extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor.

the twin-arginine signal motif and the secretory (Sec) avoidance motif typical 
of proteins secreted by the twin-arginine translocation (TAT) system. The same 
study shows that FecR is indeed secreted by Tat and represents a new class of 
bitopic Tat-dependent membrane proteins.

Outer-membrane TonB-dependent transporters, such as the Escherichia coli ferric 
citrate transporter FecA, interact with the inner-membrane protein TonB through 
an energy-coupling segment termed the Ton box. In FecA, which regulates its own 
transcription, the Ton box is preceded by an N-terminal extension that interacts 
with the inner-membrane protein FecR. Here, site-directed spin labeling was used 
to examine the structural basis for transcriptional signaling and Ton box 
regulation in FecA. EPR spectroscopy indicates that regions of the N-terminal 
domain are in conformational exchange, consistent with its role as a protein 
binding element; however, the local fold and dynamics of the domain are not 
altered by substrate or TonB. Distance restraints derived from pulse EPR were 
used to generate models for the position of the extension in the apo, 
substrate-, and TonB-bound states. In the apo state, this domain is positioned 
at the periplasmic surface of FecA, where it interacts with the Ton box and 
blocks access of the Ton box to the periplasm. Substrate addition rotates the 
transcriptional domain and exposes the Ton box, leading to a disorder transition 
in the Ton box that may facilitate interactions with TonB. When a soluble 
fragment of TonB is bound to FecA, the transcriptional domain is displaced to 
one edge of the barrel, consistent with a proposed β-strand exchange mechanism. 
However, neither substrate nor TonB displaces the N-terminus further into the 
periplasm. This result suggests that the intact TonB system mediates both 
signaling and transport by unfolding portions of the transporter.

Energy-coupled outer membrane transport proteins and regulatory proteins.

FhuA and FecA are two examples of energy-coupled outer membrane import proteins 
of gram-negative bacteria. FhuA transports iron complexed by the siderophore 
ferrichrome and serves as a receptor for phages, a toxic bacterial peptide, and 
a toxic protein. FecA transports diferric dicitrate and regulates transcription 
of an operon encoding five ferric citrate (Fec) transport genes. Properties of 
FhuA mutants selected according to the FhuA crystal structure are described. 
FhuA mutants in the TonB box, the hatch, and the beta-barrel are rather robust. 
TonB box mutants in FhuA FecA, FepA, Cir, and BtuB are compared; some mutations 
are suppressed by mutations in TonB. Mutant studies have not revealed a 
ferrichrome diffusion pathway, and tolerance to mutations in the region linking 
the TonB box to the hatch does not disclose a mechanism for how energy transfer 
from the cytoplasmic membrane to FhuA changes the conformation of FhuA such that 
bound substrates are released, the pore is opened, and substrates enter the 
periplasm, or how surface loops change their conformation such that 
TonB-dependent phages bind irreversibly and release their DNA into the cells. 
The FhuA and FecA crystal structures do not disclose the mechanism of these 
proteins, but they provide important information for specific functional 
studies. FecA is also a regulatory protein that transduces a signal from the 
cell surface into the cytoplasm. The interacting subdomains of the proteins in 
the FecA --> FecR --> FecI --> RNA polymerase signal transduction pathway 
resulting in fecABCDE transcription have been determined. Energy-coupled 
transporters transport not only iron and vitamin B12, but also other substrates 
of very low abundance such as sugars across the outer membrane; transcription 
regulation of the transport genes may occur similarly to that of the Fec 
transport genes.

Ferric citrate transport in Escherichia coli involves proteins encoded by the 
fec genes, including the transport and signaling protein FecA and the signal 
transducing protein FecR. Randomly isolated FecA point mutants showed a reduced 
interaction with FecR and a reduced transcription initiation of the ferric 
citrate transport genes. The mutations were localized on one side of the FecA 
signaling domain, which might form the interface to FecR. Some of the mutants 
showed strongly reduced iron transport rates, which suggests that the signaling 
domain affects the structure of the FecA transporter domain.

Studies of the ferric citrate transport genes in Escherichia coli K-12 have 
revealed a novel type of transcriptional regulation. The inducer, ferric 
citrate, binds to an outer membrane protein and must not be transported into the 
cells to initiate transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes. Rather, a 
signaling cascade from the cell surface across the outer membrane, the 
periplasm, and the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm transmits information 
on the presence of the inducer in the culture medium into the cytoplasm, where 
gene transcription occurs. The outer membrane protein FecA serves as a signal 
receiver and as a signal transmitter across the outer membrane. The FecR protein 
serves as a signal receiver in the periplasm and as a signal transmitter across 
the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the FecI sigma factor is 
activated to bind RNA polymerase and specifically initiate transcription of the 
fecABCDE transport genes by binding to the promoter upstream of the fecA gene. 
Transcription of the fecI fecR regulatory genes is repressed by Fe2+ bound to 
the Fur repressor protein. Under iron-limiting conditions, Fur is not loaded 
with Fe2+, the fecI and fecR genes are transcribed, and the FecI and FecR 
proteins are synthesized and respond to the presence of ferric citrate in the 
medium when ferric citrate binds to the FecA protein. Regulation of the fec 
genes represents the paradigm of a growing number of gene regulation systems 
involving transmembrane signaling across three cellular compartments.

Gram negative bacteria can detect environmental iron using outer membrane 
transporters (OMTs), and then regulate certain transport genes to take advantage 
of a readily available iron source. This process begins with an iron complex 
being bound by an OMT, and results in a signal being sent across the outer 
membrane, the periplasmic space, and the inner membrane, to a sigma factor that 
interacts with RNA polymerase and initiates transcription of relevant genes. 
Many of the interactions contributing to signalling have been observed by 
genetic and biochemical studies, but structural studies, which potentially show 
these interactions in molecular detail, have been limited. In this issue, 
Garcia-Herrero and Vogel describe an NMR structure of the periplasmic domain of 
an OMT, which had not been seen in previous X-ray crystal structures. This 
domain transmits the 'iron availability' signal to the next protein in the 
signal transduction cascade, which sits in the inner membrane and extends into 
the periplasm. The new structure extends our knowledge of transporter 
architecture and suggests how signalling may occur across the outer membrane.

In Escherichia coli K-12, transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes 
fecABCDE is initiated by binding of diferric dicitrate to the outer membrane 
protein FecA which elicits a signaling cascade from the cell surface to the 
cytoplasm. The FecI sigma factor is only active in the presence of FecR, which 
transfers the signal across the cytoplasmic membrane. In other bacteria, fecIRA 
homologues control iron transport gene transcription by siderophores other than 
citrate. However, in most cases, the FecI homologues are active in the absence 
of the FecR homologues, which might function as anti-sigma factors. Since not 
all E. coli strains contain a fec system, we determined the occurrence of fec 
genes in selected Enterobacteriaceae and the dependence of FecI activity on 
FecR. Incomplete FecIRA systems were chromosomally encoded in Enterobacter 
aerogenes strains and plasmid-encoded in K. pneumoniae. E. coli B, Photorhabdus 
luminescens and one of three Klebsiella pneumoniae strains had a functional 
FecIRA regulatory system as in E. coli K-12. The cytoplasmic N-terminal FecR 
fragments caused constitutive FecI activity in the absence of ferric citrate. 
The PCR-generated mutant FecI(D40G) was inactive and FecI(S15P) was partially 
active. FecR of E. coli K-12 activated FecI of all tested strains except FecI 
encoded on the virulence plasmid pLVPK of K. pneumoniae, which differed from E. 
coli K-12 FecI by having mutations in region 4, which is important for 
interaction with FecR. The C-terminally truncated FecR homologue of pLVPK was 
inactive. pLVPK-encoded FecA contains a 38-residue sequence in front of the 
signal sequence that did not prevent processing and proper integration of FecA 
into the outer membrane of E. coli and lacks the signaling sequence required for 
transcription initiation of the fec transport genes, making it 
induction-incompetent but transport-competent. The evidence indicates that 
fecIRABCDE genes are acquired by horizontal DNA transfer and can undergo 
debilitating mutations.

Transcription of the fecABCDE ferric citrate transport genes of Escherichia coli 
K-12 is initiated by a signaling cascade from the cell surface into the 
cytoplasm. FecR receives the signal in the periplasm from the outer membrane 
protein FecA loaded with ferric citrate, transmits the signal across the 
cytoplasmic membrane, and converts FecI in the cytoplasm to an active sigma 
factor. In this study, it was shown through the use of a bacterial two-hybrid 
system that, in the periplasm, the C-terminal FecR(237-317) fragment interacts 
with the N-terminal FecA(1-79) fragment. In the same C-terminal region, amino 
acid residues important for the interaction of FecR with FecA were identified by 
random and site-directed mutagenesis. They were preferentially located in and 
around a leucine motif (residues 247 to 268) which was found to be highly 
conserved in FecR-like proteins. The degree of residual binding of FecR mutant 
proteins to FecA was correlated with the degree of transcription initiation in 
response to ferric citrate in the culture medium. Three randomly generated 
inactive FecR mutants, FecR(L254E), FecR(L269G), and FecR(F284L), were 
suppressed to different degrees by the mutants FecA(G39R) and FecR(D43E). One 
FecR mutant, FecR (D138E, V197A), induced fecA promoter-directed transcription 
constitutively in the absence of ferric citrate and bound more strongly than 
wild-type FecR to FecA. The data showed that FecR interacts in the periplasm 
with FecA to confer ferric citrate-induced transcription of the fec transport 
genes and identified sites in FecR and FecA that are important for signal 
transduction.

Escherichia coli RseP, a member of the site-2 protease family of intramembrane 
proteases, is involved in the activation of the σE extracytoplasmic stress 
response and elimination of signal peptides from the cytoplasmic membrane. 
However, whether RseP has additional cellular functions is unclear. In this 
study, we used mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis to search 
for new substrates that might reveal unknown physiological roles for RseP. Our 
data showed that the levels of several Fec system proteins encoded by the 
fecABCDE operon (fec operon) were significantly decreased in an RseP-deficient 
strain. The Fec system is responsible for the uptake of ferric citrate, and the 
transcription of the fec operon is controlled by FecI, an alternative sigma 
factor, and its regulator FecR, a single-pass transmembrane protein. Assays with 
a fec operon expression reporter demonstrated that the proteolytic activity of 
RseP is essential for the ferric citrate-dependent upregulation of the fec 
operon. Analysis using the FecR protein and FecR-derived model proteins showed 
that FecR undergoes sequential processing at the membrane and that RseP 
participates in the last step of this sequential processing to generate the 
N-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of FecR that participates in the transcription 
of the fec operon with FecI. A shortened FecR construct was not dependent on 
RseP for activation, confirming this cleavage step is the essential and 
sufficient role of RseP. Our study unveiled that E. coli RseP performs the 
intramembrane proteolysis of FecR, a novel physiological role that is essential 
for regulating iron uptake by the ferric citrate transport system.

In Escherichia coli, citrate-mediated iron transport is a key nonheme pathway 
for the acquisition of iron. Binding of ferric citrate to the outer membrane 
protein FecA induces a signal cascade that ultimately activates the cytoplasmic 
sigma factor FecI, resulting in transcription of the fecABCDE ferric citrate 
transport genes. Central to this process is signal transduction mediated by the 
inner membrane protein FecR. FecR spans the inner membrane through a single 
transmembrane helix, which is flanked by cytoplasm- and periplasm-orientated 
moieties at the N and C termini. The transmembrane helix of FecR resembles a 
twin-arginine signal sequence, and the substitution of the paired arginine 
residues of the consensus motif decouples the FecR-FecI signal cascade, 
rendering the cells unable to activate transcription of the fec operon when 
grown on ferric citrate. Furthermore, the fusion of beta-lactamase C-terminal to 
the FecR transmembrane helix results in translocation of the C-terminal domain 
that is dependent on the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system. Our findings 
demonstrate that FecR belongs to a select group of bitopic inner membrane 
proteins that contain an internal twin-arginine signal sequence.IMPORTANCE Iron 
is essential for nearly all living organisms due to its role in metabolic 
processes and as a cofactor for many enzymes. The FecRI signal transduction 
pathway regulates citrate-mediated iron import in many Gram-negative bacteria, 
including Escherichia coli The interactions of FecR with the outer membrane 
protein FecA and cytoplasmic anti-sigma factor FecI have been extensively 
studied. However, the mechanism by which FecR inserts into the membrane has not 
previously been reported. In this study, we demonstrate that the targeting of 
FecR to the cytoplasmic membrane is dependent on the Tat system. As such, FecR 
represents a new class of bitopic Tat-dependent membrane proteins with an 
internal twin-arginine signal sequence.

the twin-arginine signal motif and the secretory (Sec) avoidance motif typical 
of proteins secreted by the twin-arginine translocation (TAT) system. The same 
study shows that FecR is indeed secreted by Tat and represents a new class of 
bitopic Tat-dependent membrane proteins.

Energy-coupled outer membrane transport proteins and regulatory proteins.

FhuA and FecA are two examples of energy-coupled outer membrane import proteins 
of gram-negative bacteria. FhuA transports iron complexed by the siderophore 
ferrichrome and serves as a receptor for phages, a toxic bacterial peptide, and 
a toxic protein. FecA transports diferric dicitrate and regulates transcription 
of an operon encoding five ferric citrate (Fec) transport genes. Properties of 
FhuA mutants selected according to the FhuA crystal structure are described. 
FhuA mutants in the TonB box, the hatch, and the beta-barrel are rather robust. 
TonB box mutants in FhuA FecA, FepA, Cir, and BtuB are compared; some mutations 
are suppressed by mutations in TonB. Mutant studies have not revealed a 
ferrichrome diffusion pathway, and tolerance to mutations in the region linking 
the TonB box to the hatch does not disclose a mechanism for how energy transfer 
from the cytoplasmic membrane to FhuA changes the conformation of FhuA such that 
bound substrates are released, the pore is opened, and substrates enter the 
periplasm, or how surface loops change their conformation such that 
TonB-dependent phages bind irreversibly and release their DNA into the cells. 
The FhuA and FecA crystal structures do not disclose the mechanism of these 
proteins, but they provide important information for specific functional 
studies. FecA is also a regulatory protein that transduces a signal from the 
cell surface into the cytoplasm. The interacting subdomains of the proteins in 
the FecA --> FecR --> FecI --> RNA polymerase signal transduction pathway 
resulting in fecABCDE transcription have been determined. Energy-coupled 
transporters transport not only iron and vitamin B12, but also other substrates 
of very low abundance such as sugars across the outer membrane; transcription 
regulation of the transport genes may occur similarly to that of the Fec 
transport genes.

Studies of the ferric citrate transport genes in Escherichia coli K-12 have 
revealed a novel type of transcriptional regulation. The inducer, ferric 
citrate, binds to an outer membrane protein and must not be transported into the 
cells to initiate transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes. Rather, a 
signaling cascade from the cell surface across the outer membrane, the 
periplasm, and the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm transmits information 
on the presence of the inducer in the culture medium into the cytoplasm, where 
gene transcription occurs. The outer membrane protein FecA serves as a signal 
receiver and as a signal transmitter across the outer membrane. The FecR protein 
serves as a signal receiver in the periplasm and as a signal transmitter across 
the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the FecI sigma factor is 
activated to bind RNA polymerase and specifically initiate transcription of the 
fecABCDE transport genes by binding to the promoter upstream of the fecA gene. 
Transcription of the fecI fecR regulatory genes is repressed by Fe2+ bound to 
the Fur repressor protein. Under iron-limiting conditions, Fur is not loaded 
with Fe2+, the fecI and fecR genes are transcribed, and the FecI and FecR 
proteins are synthesized and respond to the presence of ferric citrate in the 
medium when ferric citrate binds to the FecA protein. Regulation of the fec 
genes represents the paradigm of a growing number of gene regulation systems 
involving transmembrane signaling across three cellular compartments.

The ferric citrate transport system of Escherichia coli is the first example of 
a transcription initiation mechanism that starts at the cell surface. The 
inducer, ferric citrate, binds to an outer membrane transport protein, and 
without further transport elicits a signal that is transmitted across the outer 
membrane, the periplasm, and the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm. Signal 
transfer across the three subcellular compartments is mediated by the outer 
membrane transport protein that interacts in the periplasm with a cytoplasmic 
transmembrane protein. The latter is required for activation of a sigma factor 
which belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor family. A similar 
kind of transcription regulation has been demonstrated in Pseudomonas putida, P. 
aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aerobacter aerogenes, 
Bordetella pertussis, B. bronchseptica, B. avium, and Ralstonia solanacearum. 
The genomes of P. putida, P. aeruginosa, Nitrosomonas europaea, Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron and Caulobacter crescentus predict the existence of many more 
such transcriptional regulatory devices.

Regulation of the FecI-type ECF sigma factor by transmembrane signalling.

Induction of the ferric citrate transport genes of Escherichia coli K-12 
involves a signalling cascade that starts at the cell surface and proceeds to 
the cytoplasm. Three specific proteins are involved: FecA in the outer membrane, 
FecR in the cytoplasmic membrane, and FecI in the cytoplasm. The binding of 
dinuclear ferric citrate to FecA causes substantial structural changes in FecA, 
triggering the signal cascade. The amino-proximal end of FecA interacts with the 
carboxy-proximal end of FecR in the periplasm. FecR then transmits the signal 
across the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm and activates the FecI sigma 
factor, which binds to the RNA polymerase core enzyme and directs the RNA 
polymerase to the promoter upstream of the fecABCDE transport genes to initiate 
transcription. Transcription of the fecIR regulatory genes and the fec transport 
genes is repressed by the Fur protein loaded with Fe(2+). Therefore, 
transcription of the fec transport genes is subjected to double control: cells 
first detect iron deficiency and respond by synthesis of the regulatory proteins 
FecI and FecR, which initiate transcription of the fec transport genes, provided 
ferric citrate is available. FecI belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma 
factors, which are widespread among bacteria. With the recent sequencing of 
complete microbial genomes, it has become apparent that the FecIRA cascade is 
now a paradigm for the regulatory control of FecI family sigmas in Gram-negative 
bacteria.

FhuA and FecA are two examples of energy-coupled outer membrane import proteins 
of gram-negative bacteria. FhuA transports iron complexed by the siderophore 
ferrichrome and serves as a receptor for phages, a toxic bacterial peptide, and 
a toxic protein. FecA transports diferric dicitrate and regulates transcription 
of an operon encoding five ferric citrate (Fec) transport genes. Properties of 
FhuA mutants selected according to the FhuA crystal structure are described. 
FhuA mutants in the TonB box, the hatch, and the beta-barrel are rather robust. 
TonB box mutants in FhuA FecA, FepA, Cir, and BtuB are compared; some mutations 
are suppressed by mutations in TonB. Mutant studies have not revealed a 
ferrichrome diffusion pathway, and tolerance to mutations in the region linking 
the TonB box to the hatch does not disclose a mechanism for how energy transfer 
from the cytoplasmic membrane to FhuA changes the conformation of FhuA such that 
bound substrates are released, the pore is opened, and substrates enter the 
periplasm, or how surface loops change their conformation such that 
TonB-dependent phages bind irreversibly and release their DNA into the cells. 
The FhuA and FecA crystal structures do not disclose the mechanism of these 
proteins, but they provide important information for specific functional 
studies. FecA is also a regulatory protein that transduces a signal from the 
cell surface into the cytoplasm. The interacting subdomains of the proteins in 
the FecA --> FecR --> FecI --> RNA polymerase signal transduction pathway 
resulting in fecABCDE transcription have been determined. Energy-coupled 
transporters transport not only iron and vitamin B12, but also other substrates 
of very low abundance such as sugars across the outer membrane; transcription 
regulation of the transport genes may occur similarly to that of the Fec 
transport genes.

Citrate and iron have to enter only the periplasmic space in order to induce the 
citrate-dependent iron(III) transport system of Escherichia coli. The five 
transport genes fecABCDE form an operon and are transcribed from fecA to fecE. 
Two genes, termed fecI and fecR, that mediate induction by iron(III) dicitrate 
have been identified upstream of fecA. The fecI gene encodes a protein of 173 
amino acids (molecular weight, 19,478); the fecR gene encodes a protein of 317 
amino acids (molecular weight, 35,529). Chromosomal fecI::Mu d1 mutants were 
unable to grow with iron(III) dicitrate as the sole iron source and synthesized 
no FecA outer membrane receptor protein. Growth was restored by transformation 
with plasmids encoding fecI or fecI and fecR. FecA and beta-galactosidase 
syntheses under transcription control of the fecB gene (fecB::Mu d1) were 
constitutive in fecI transformants and were regulated by iron(III) dicitrate in 
fecI fecR transformants. The amino acid sequence of the FecI protein contains a 
region close to the carboxy-terminal end for which a helix-turn-helix motif is 
predicted, which is typical for DNA-binding regulatory proteins. The FecI 
protein was found in the membrane, and the FecR protein was found in the 
periplasmic fraction. It is proposed that the FecR protein is the sensor that 
recognizes iron(III) dicitrate in the periplasm. The FecI protein activates fec 
gene expression by binding to the fec operator region. In the absence of 
citrate, FecR inactivates FecI. The lack of sequence homologies to other 
transmembrane signaling proteins and the location of the two proteins suggest a 
new type of transmembrane control mechanism.

Escherichia coli B and K-12 express a citrate-dependent iron(III) transport 
system for which three structural genes and their arrangement and products have 
been determined. The fecA gene of E. coli B consists of 2,322 nucleotides and 
encodes a polypeptide containing a signal sequence of 33 amino acids. The 
cleavage site was determined by amino acid sequence analysis of the unprocessed 
protein and the mature protein. For the processed form a length of 741 amino 
acids was calculated. The mature FecA protein in the outer membrane contains at 
the N terminus the "TonB box," a pentapeptide, which has hitherto been found in 
all receptors and colicins which functionally require the TonB protein. In 
addition, the dyad repeat sequence GAAAATAATTCTTATTTCG is proposed to serve as 
the binding site of the Fur iron repressor protein. The fecB gene was mapped 
downstream of fecA and encodes a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 
30,000. It was synthesized as a precursor, and the mature form was found in the 
periplasm. The fecD gene follows fecB and was related to a membrane-bound 
protein with an apparent molecular weight of 28,000. In Mu d1 insertion mutants 
upstream of fecA, the fec genes were not inducible by iron limitation and 
citrate, indicating a regulatory region, termed fecI, which controls fec gene 
expression.

Functional interaction of region 4 of the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor 
FecI with the cytoplasmic portion of the FecR transmembrane protein of the 
Escherichia coli ferric citrate transport system.

Transcriptional regulation of the ferric citrate transport genes of Escherichia 
coli is initiated by the binding of ferric citrate to the outer membrane protein 
FecA. This binding elicits a signal that is transmitted by FecR across the 
cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the sigma factor FecI directs the 
RNA polymerase to the promoter upstream of the fecABCDE genes. An in vivo 
deletion analysis using a bacterial two-hybrid system assigned the interaction 
of the FecR and FecI proteins to the cytoplasmic portion of the FecR 
transmembrane protein and region 4 of FecI. Missense mutations randomly 
generated by PCR were localized to region 4 of FecI, and the mutants were 
impaired with regard to the interaction of FecR with FecI and fecB-lacZ 
transcription. The cloned region 4 of FecI interfered with fecB-lacZ 
transcription. Interaction of N-proximal regions of predicted FecR homologs with 
region 4 of predicted FecI homologs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was demonstrated. 
The interaction was specific in that only cognate protein pairs interacted with 
each other; no interactions occurred between heterologous combinations of the P. 
aeruginosa proteins and between a P. aeruginosa FecI homolog and E. coli FecR. 
The results demonstrate that region 4 of FecI specifically binds FecR and that 
this binding is necessary for FecI to function as a sigma factor.

Control of the ferric citrate transport system of Escherichia coli: mutations in 
region 2.1 of the FecI extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor suppress mutations 
in the FecR transmembrane regulatory protein.

Transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes is initiated by binding of 
ferric citrate to the FecA protein in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli 
K-12. Bound ferric citrate does not have to be transported but initiates a 
signal that is transmitted by FecA across the outer membrane and by FecR across 
the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the FecI 
extracytoplasmic-function (ECF) sigma factor becomes active. In this study, we 
isolated transcription initiation-negative missense mutants in the cytoplasmic 
region of FecR that were located at four sites, L13Q, W19R, W39R, and W50R, 
which are highly conserved in FecR-like open reading frames of the Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, 
and Caulobacter crescentus genomes. The cytoplasmic portion of the FecR mutant 
proteins, FecR(1-85), did not interact with wild-type FecI, in contrast to 
wild-type FecR(1-85), which induced FecI-mediated fecB transport gene 
transcription. Two missense mutations in region 2.1 of FecI, S15A and H20E, 
partially restored induction of ferric citrate transport gene induction of the 
fecR mutants by ferric citrate. Region 2.1 of sigma(70) is thought to bind RNA 
polymerase core enzyme; the residual activity of mutated FecI in the absence of 
FecR, however, was not higher than that of wild-type FecI. In addition, missense 
mutations in the fecI promoter region resulted in a twofold increased 
transcription in fecR wild-type cells and a partial restoration of fec transport 
gene transcription in the fecR mutants. The mutations reduced binding of the 
Fe(2+) Fur repressor and as a consequence enhanced fecI transcription. The data 
reveal properties of the FecI ECF factor distinct from those of sigma(70) and 
further support the novel transcription initiation model in which the 
cytoplasmic portion of FecR is important for FecI activity.

Iron regulates transcription of the Escherichia coli ferric citrate transport

Ferric citrate induces transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes 
fecABCDE in Escherichia coli by binding to the outer-membrane receptor protein 
FecA without entering the cell. Replete iron concentrations inhibit 
transcription of the fec transport system via the iron-loaded Fur repressor. 
Here we show that the Fur repressor activated by Mn2+ (used instead of Fe2+) 
binds to the promoter of the regulatory genes fecIR and to the promoter of 
fecABCDE. DNase I footprint analysis revealed that Mn2+-Fur (50 nM) protected 30 
nucleotides of the coding strand and 24 nucleotides of the noncoding strand of 
the fecIR promoter. Higher amounts of Mn2+-Fur (100 nM) covered 41 nucleotides 
of the coding strand of the fecIR promoter and 38 nucleotides of the coding 
strand of the fecA promoter. The corresponding region of the noncoding strand of 
the fecA promoter was hypersensitive to DNase I. The results of a deletion 
analysis of the fecA promoter supported the previously assigned -35 and -10 
regions and nucleotide position +11 for FecI-RNA polymerase interaction. 
Induction of fecIR transcription by iron limitation increased fecB-lacZ 
transcription 3.5-fold, whereas under constitutive fecIR transcription, iron 
limitation increased fecB-lacZ transcription twofold. The two iron-regulated 
sites of fec transport gene transcription suggest a fast response to sufficient 
intracellular iron concentrations by repression of fecABCDE transcription and a 
slower adaptation as the result of fecIR transcription inhibition.

SigX of Bacillus subtilis replaces the ECF sigma factor fecI of Escherichia coli 
and is inhibited by RsiX.

Brutsche S(1), Braun V.

Author information:
(1)Mikrobiologie II, Universität Tübingen, Germany.

Analysis of the Bacillus subtilis genome sequence revealed two open reading 
frames, designated sigX and ypuN (now termed rsiX), that are homologous to fecI 
and fecR, respectively, of Escherichia coli. fecI encodes a sigma 70-type factor 
that is necessary for transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes 
fecABCDE. fecR encodes a cytoplasmic transmembrane protein that is required for 
the induction of fec transport gene transcription by ferric citrate binding to 
the FecA outer membrane receptor protein. Investigation of the SigX and RsiX 
activities disclosed that they are not involved in ferric citrate 
utilization--since ferric citrate did not serve as an iron source for B. 
subtilis SG64--or in the regulation of any other ferric siderophore transport 
system tested. Strains deleted for sigX or rsiX displayed no phenotype under 
aerobic or anoxic conditions. However, cloned sigX complemented an E. coli fecI 
mutant, and the Fur box upstream of sigX responded to the E. coli iron 
regulatory protein Fur. The purified SigX protein was required for in vitro 
transcription of a sigX-containing DNA fragment by the E. coli RNA polymerase 
core enzyme. Autoregulation of sigX was also found in vivo using a sigX'-lacZ 
gene fusion. RsiX inhibited SigX activity in vivo and in vitro and stabilized 
the SigX protein. RsiX was localized in the membrane fraction. When RsiX is 
present, SigX is found in the membrane fraction; in the absence of RsiX, some 
SigX is detectable in the cytoplasm. We conclude that SigX is a sigma factor 
that belongs to the ECF (extracytoplasmic function) sigma 70-factor family. It 
is not known which promoters are recognized by SigX in B. subtilis. SigX may be 
involved in the regulation of iron metabolism, as evidenced by its activity in 
E. coli.

Surface signaling in transcriptional regulation of the ferric citrate transport

FecI supports its essential role in fec transport gene transcription.

Ferric citrate induces transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes (fec) 
in escherichia coli by binding to the outer membrane receptor protein FecA 
without entering the cell. The signal elicited by ferric citrate crosses the 
outer membrane via TonB, ExbB, and ExbD. FecR transmits the signal across the 
cytoplasmic membrane and activates FecI located in the cytoplasm. FecI belongs 
to a subgroup of sigma factors that respond to extracytoplasmic stimuli. 
Chromosomal insertion and deletion mutations were generated in fecI; the 
resulting mutants were totally devoid of FecA production and fecB-lacZ 
expression. Iron starvation did not derepress fec transport gene transcription 
in fecI mutants. Missense point mutations were generated in the predicted 
helix-turn-helix motif of FecI to examine its role in transcription initiation. 
Replacement of glutamate by alanine (E141A) at the third position in the first 
helix reduced the residual activity of FecI in the absence of ferric citrate to 
30% of the wild-type level, but induced fec transcription almost normally n the 
presence of ferric citrate. Mutant FecI(K145E) displayed 156% of the activity of 
wild-type FecI in the absence of ferric citrate and conferred full induction by 
ferric citrate. Mutant FecI(K155E), which has a mutation in the second helix, 
showed 9% of the wild-type activity in the presence of ferric citrate and 78% in 
the absence of ferric citrate. The reduced activity of FecI(K155E) was also 
shown in vitro by DNA binding assays with cell lysates; in gel retardation 
experiments FecI(K155E) reduced the electrophoretic mobility of fecA 
promoter-containing DNA less than did wild-type FecI. fecI is not autoregulated, 
as demonstrated by the lack of FecI-induced fecI-lacZ expression in vivo and by 
the lack of specific fecI transcription in vitro. Instead, formation of fecI 
mRNA requires sigma 70. We conclude that transcription of the fec transport 
genes is regulated by FecI, which responds to ferric citrate via FecR. fecI and 
fecR co-transcription is inhibited by the iron-loaded Fur repressor, which then 
results in a low level of transcription of the fec transport genes.

Transcriptional regulation of ferric citrate transport in Escherichia coli K-12.

Transcription of the ferric citrate transport system of Escherichia coli K-12 is 
repressed by Fe(2+)-Fur and activated by ferric citrate. Ferric citrate does not 
have to enter the cytoplasm; it initiates a signal transduction mechanism by 
binding to the outer membrane receptor FecA. Presumably, a conformational change 
is transmitted in a TonB-dependent manner to the FecR protein. FecR activates 
FecI, and FecI activates transcription of the fecABCDE transport genes. In this 
communication, FecI was isolated after cloning fecI downstream of an ideal 
ribosome-binding site. Overexpressed FecI formed inclusion bodies which were 
solubilized and purified in active form using a mild detergent. FecI, in 
conjunction with RNA polymerase core enzyme, directed transcription from the 
fecA promoter in an in vitro run-off transcription assay. Furthermore, FecI 
retarded the electrophoretic mobility of a specific 75 bp DNA fragment located 
upstream of fecA. An in vivo competition experiment between the fecA promoters 
of wild-type and mutant strains identified the nucleotide positions 2747, 2749, 
2751 and 2753, located within the 75 bp fragment, as important for FecI-induced 
transcription. Mobility band shift of fecA promoter DNA caused by cell lysates 
required growth of cells in the presence of ferric citrate and expression of 
FecA, FecI and FecR. These data support the previous assignment of FecI, based 
on sequence homologies, to a new subfamily of eubacterial RNA polymerase sigma 
70 factors that respond to extra-cytoplasmic stimuli and regulate 
extracytoplasmic functions.

Transcription of the region encoding the ferric dicitrate-transport system in 
Escherichia coli: similarity between promoters for fecA and for extracytoplasmic 
function sigma factors.

We have analyzed the molecular mechanism of regulation of the ferric dicitrate 
transport system in Escherichia coli (Ec), by studying the transcription of the 
regulatory and structural genes under various environmental conditions, and by 
determining the location of their transcriptional start points and promoter 
regions. We report here that the main species observed in Northern hybridization 
analyses were a 2.5-kb mRNA, encoded by the outer membrane protein receptor gene 
fecA, and a 1.5-kb mRNA encoded by a region including the fecIR genes. The 
synthesis of the 2.5-kb fecA mRNA is regulated by both citrate and iron. 
Furthermore, transcription of fecA is dependent on the presence of FecI. The 
promoter region for the fecA mRNA, a likely site of action for FecI, is not 
related to the consensus promoter region for sigma 70 RNA polymerase in Ec K-12. 
However, it shows greatest similarity with promoters of genes regulated by a new 
sub-family of sigma factors, i.e., the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma 
factors, which are associated with the expression of genes involved in 
extracytoplasmic functions, suggesting that FecI may act as a specialized sigma 
factor. We also show that the fecB,C,D,E transport genes are linked in operon 
fashion to fecA. Since the levels of the fecB,C,D,E RNAs are extremely low, as 
compared to the level of fecA mRNA, it is likely that processing from the 3' end 
must occur and stop near the end of fecA where a hairpin structure is located.

Regulation of citrate-dependent iron transport of Escherichia coli: fecR is 
required for transcription activation by FecI.

Citrate-dependent Fe3+ transport into Escherichia coli K-12 is induced by iron 
and citrate. The inducer is probably ferric dicitrate which does not have to be 
taken up into the cytoplasm to induce transcription of the fec transport genes. 
Two regulatory genes, fecI and fecR, located upstream of the fecABCDE transport 
genes, are required for induction. We report that in vivo the chromosomally 
encoded FecI protein activates transcription of the fecA and fecB transport 
genes in response to ferric citrate and the FecR protein. Cells expressing 
chromosomally and plasmid-encoded truncated FecR derivatives no longer responded 
to ferric citrate and expressed the fec transport genes constitutively. The 
smallest active FecR derivative contained 59 amino acid residues as compared to 
the 317 residues of wild-type FecR. Constitutive induction was lower than 
induction of the FecR wild-type strain by ferric citrate. It is concluded that 
the N-terminal portion of FecR activates FecI and that the C-terminal portion of 
FecR responds to ferric citrate. Transcription of the fec transport genes is 
positively regulated by FecI and FecR and negatively regulated by the Fe2(+)-Fur 
repressor. Transcription activation and repression may occur independently of 
each other.

In Escherichia coli, citrate-mediated iron transport is a key nonheme pathway 
for the acquisition of iron. Binding of ferric citrate to the outer membrane 
protein FecA induces a signal cascade that ultimately activates the cytoplasmic 
sigma factor FecI, resulting in transcription of the fecABCDE ferric citrate 
transport genes. Central to this process is signal transduction mediated by the 
inner membrane protein FecR. FecR spans the inner membrane through a single 
transmembrane helix, which is flanked by cytoplasm- and periplasm-orientated 
moieties at the N and C termini. The transmembrane helix of FecR resembles a 
twin-arginine signal sequence, and the substitution of the paired arginine 
residues of the consensus motif decouples the FecR-FecI signal cascade, 
rendering the cells unable to activate transcription of the fec operon when 
grown on ferric citrate. Furthermore, the fusion of beta-lactamase C-terminal to 
the FecR transmembrane helix results in translocation of the C-terminal domain 
that is dependent on the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system. Our findings 
demonstrate that FecR belongs to a select group of bitopic inner membrane 
proteins that contain an internal twin-arginine signal sequence.IMPORTANCE Iron 
is essential for nearly all living organisms due to its role in metabolic 
processes and as a cofactor for many enzymes. The FecRI signal transduction 
pathway regulates citrate-mediated iron import in many Gram-negative bacteria, 
including Escherichia coli The interactions of FecR with the outer membrane 
protein FecA and cytoplasmic anti-sigma factor FecI have been extensively 
studied. However, the mechanism by which FecR inserts into the membrane has not 
previously been reported. In this study, we demonstrate that the targeting of 
FecR to the cytoplasmic membrane is dependent on the Tat system. As such, FecR 
represents a new class of bitopic Tat-dependent membrane proteins with an 
internal twin-arginine signal sequence.

Energy-coupled outer membrane transport proteins and regulatory proteins.

FhuA and FecA are two examples of energy-coupled outer membrane import proteins 
of gram-negative bacteria. FhuA transports iron complexed by the siderophore 
ferrichrome and serves as a receptor for phages, a toxic bacterial peptide, and 
a toxic protein. FecA transports diferric dicitrate and regulates transcription 
of an operon encoding five ferric citrate (Fec) transport genes. Properties of 
FhuA mutants selected according to the FhuA crystal structure are described. 
FhuA mutants in the TonB box, the hatch, and the beta-barrel are rather robust. 
TonB box mutants in FhuA FecA, FepA, Cir, and BtuB are compared; some mutations 
are suppressed by mutations in TonB. Mutant studies have not revealed a 
ferrichrome diffusion pathway, and tolerance to mutations in the region linking 
the TonB box to the hatch does not disclose a mechanism for how energy transfer 
from the cytoplasmic membrane to FhuA changes the conformation of FhuA such that 
bound substrates are released, the pore is opened, and substrates enter the 
periplasm, or how surface loops change their conformation such that 
TonB-dependent phages bind irreversibly and release their DNA into the cells. 
The FhuA and FecA crystal structures do not disclose the mechanism of these 
proteins, but they provide important information for specific functional 
studies. FecA is also a regulatory protein that transduces a signal from the 
cell surface into the cytoplasm. The interacting subdomains of the proteins in 
the FecA --> FecR --> FecI --> RNA polymerase signal transduction pathway 
resulting in fecABCDE transcription have been determined. Energy-coupled 
transporters transport not only iron and vitamin B12, but also other substrates 
of very low abundance such as sugars across the outer membrane; transcription 
regulation of the transport genes may occur similarly to that of the Fec 
transport genes.

Studies of the ferric citrate transport genes in Escherichia coli K-12 have 
revealed a novel type of transcriptional regulation. The inducer, ferric 
citrate, binds to an outer membrane protein and must not be transported into the 
cells to initiate transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes. Rather, a 
signaling cascade from the cell surface across the outer membrane, the 
periplasm, and the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm transmits information 
on the presence of the inducer in the culture medium into the cytoplasm, where 
gene transcription occurs. The outer membrane protein FecA serves as a signal 
receiver and as a signal transmitter across the outer membrane. The FecR protein 
serves as a signal receiver in the periplasm and as a signal transmitter across 
the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the FecI sigma factor is 
activated to bind RNA polymerase and specifically initiate transcription of the 
fecABCDE transport genes by binding to the promoter upstream of the fecA gene. 
Transcription of the fecI fecR regulatory genes is repressed by Fe2+ bound to 
the Fur repressor protein. Under iron-limiting conditions, Fur is not loaded 
with Fe2+, the fecI and fecR genes are transcribed, and the FecI and FecR 
proteins are synthesized and respond to the presence of ferric citrate in the 
medium when ferric citrate binds to the FecA protein. Regulation of the fec 
genes represents the paradigm of a growing number of gene regulation systems 
involving transmembrane signaling across three cellular compartments.

Occurrence and regulation of the ferric citrate transport system in Escherichia 
coli B, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Photorhabdus

In Escherichia coli K-12, transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes 
fecABCDE is initiated by binding of diferric dicitrate to the outer membrane 
protein FecA which elicits a signaling cascade from the cell surface to the 
cytoplasm. The FecI sigma factor is only active in the presence of FecR, which 
transfers the signal across the cytoplasmic membrane. In other bacteria, fecIRA 
homologues control iron transport gene transcription by siderophores other than 
citrate. However, in most cases, the FecI homologues are active in the absence 
of the FecR homologues, which might function as anti-sigma factors. Since not 
all E. coli strains contain a fec system, we determined the occurrence of fec 
genes in selected Enterobacteriaceae and the dependence of FecI activity on 
FecR. Incomplete FecIRA systems were chromosomally encoded in Enterobacter 
aerogenes strains and plasmid-encoded in K. pneumoniae. E. coli B, Photorhabdus 
luminescens and one of three Klebsiella pneumoniae strains had a functional 
FecIRA regulatory system as in E. coli K-12. The cytoplasmic N-terminal FecR 
fragments caused constitutive FecI activity in the absence of ferric citrate. 
The PCR-generated mutant FecI(D40G) was inactive and FecI(S15P) was partially 
active. FecR of E. coli K-12 activated FecI of all tested strains except FecI 
encoded on the virulence plasmid pLVPK of K. pneumoniae, which differed from E. 
coli K-12 FecI by having mutations in region 4, which is important for 
interaction with FecR. The C-terminally truncated FecR homologue of pLVPK was 
inactive. pLVPK-encoded FecA contains a 38-residue sequence in front of the 
signal sequence that did not prevent processing and proper integration of FecA 
into the outer membrane of E. coli and lacks the signaling sequence required for 
transcription initiation of the fec transport genes, making it 
induction-incompetent but transport-competent. The evidence indicates that 
fecIRABCDE genes are acquired by horizontal DNA transfer and can undergo 
debilitating mutations.

Transcription of the fecABCDE ferric citrate transport genes of Escherichia coli 
K-12 is initiated by a signaling cascade from the cell surface into the 
cytoplasm. FecR receives the signal in the periplasm from the outer membrane 
protein FecA loaded with ferric citrate, transmits the signal across the 
cytoplasmic membrane, and converts FecI in the cytoplasm to an active sigma 
factor. In this study, it was shown through the use of a bacterial two-hybrid 
system that, in the periplasm, the C-terminal FecR(237-317) fragment interacts 
with the N-terminal FecA(1-79) fragment. In the same C-terminal region, amino 
acid residues important for the interaction of FecR with FecA were identified by 
random and site-directed mutagenesis. They were preferentially located in and 
around a leucine motif (residues 247 to 268) which was found to be highly 
conserved in FecR-like proteins. The degree of residual binding of FecR mutant 
proteins to FecA was correlated with the degree of transcription initiation in 
response to ferric citrate in the culture medium. Three randomly generated 
inactive FecR mutants, FecR(L254E), FecR(L269G), and FecR(F284L), were 
suppressed to different degrees by the mutants FecA(G39R) and FecR(D43E). One 
FecR mutant, FecR (D138E, V197A), induced fecA promoter-directed transcription 
constitutively in the absence of ferric citrate and bound more strongly than 
wild-type FecR to FecA. The data showed that FecR interacts in the periplasm 
with FecA to confer ferric citrate-induced transcription of the fec transport 
genes and identified sites in FecR and FecA that are important for signal 
transduction.

Induction of the ferric citrate transport genes of Escherichia coli K-12 
involves a signalling cascade that starts at the cell surface and proceeds to 
the cytoplasm. Three specific proteins are involved: FecA in the outer membrane, 
FecR in the cytoplasmic membrane, and FecI in the cytoplasm. The binding of 
dinuclear ferric citrate to FecA causes substantial structural changes in FecA, 
triggering the signal cascade. The amino-proximal end of FecA interacts with the 
carboxy-proximal end of FecR in the periplasm. FecR then transmits the signal 
across the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm and activates the FecI sigma 
factor, which binds to the RNA polymerase core enzyme and directs the RNA 
polymerase to the promoter upstream of the fecABCDE transport genes to initiate 
transcription. Transcription of the fecIR regulatory genes and the fec transport 
genes is repressed by the Fur protein loaded with Fe(2+). Therefore, 
transcription of the fec transport genes is subjected to double control: cells 
first detect iron deficiency and respond by synthesis of the regulatory proteins 
FecI and FecR, which initiate transcription of the fec transport genes, provided 
ferric citrate is available. FecI belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma 
factors, which are widespread among bacteria. With the recent sequencing of 
complete microbial genomes, it has become apparent that the FecIRA cascade is 
now a paradigm for the regulatory control of FecI family sigmas in Gram-negative 
bacteria.

Analysis of the ferric citrate transport gene promoter of Escherichia coli.

FecI, an extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor, is required for initiation of 
transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes. A mutational analysis of 
the fecA promoter revealed that the nonconserved -10 region and a downstream 
regulatory element are important for fecA promoter activity. However, nucleotide 
substitutions in the well-conserved -35 region also have an effect on the fecA 
promoter activity. Titration of FecI suggests that the FecI-RNA polymerase 
holoenzyme does not bind strongly to the downstream regulatory element, which is 
therefore probably involved in a subsequent step of transcription initiation.

Functional interaction of region 4 of the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor

Escherichia coli ferric citrate transport system.

Transcriptional regulation of the ferric citrate transport genes of Escherichia 
coli is initiated by the binding of ferric citrate to the outer membrane protein 
FecA. This binding elicits a signal that is transmitted by FecR across the 
cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the sigma factor FecI directs the 
RNA polymerase to the promoter upstream of the fecABCDE genes. An in vivo 
deletion analysis using a bacterial two-hybrid system assigned the interaction 
of the FecR and FecI proteins to the cytoplasmic portion of the FecR 
transmembrane protein and region 4 of FecI. Missense mutations randomly 
generated by PCR were localized to region 4 of FecI, and the mutants were 
impaired with regard to the interaction of FecR with FecI and fecB-lacZ 
transcription. The cloned region 4 of FecI interfered with fecB-lacZ 
transcription. Interaction of N-proximal regions of predicted FecR homologs with 
region 4 of predicted FecI homologs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was demonstrated. 
The interaction was specific in that only cognate protein pairs interacted with 
each other; no interactions occurred between heterologous combinations of the P. 
aeruginosa proteins and between a P. aeruginosa FecI homolog and E. coli FecR. 
The results demonstrate that region 4 of FecI specifically binds FecR and that 
this binding is necessary for FecI to function as a sigma factor.

Escherichia coli RseP, a member of the site-2 protease family of intramembrane 
proteases, is involved in the activation of the σE extracytoplasmic stress 
response and elimination of signal peptides from the cytoplasmic membrane. 
However, whether RseP has additional cellular functions is unclear. In this 
study, we used mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis to search 
for new substrates that might reveal unknown physiological roles for RseP. Our 
data showed that the levels of several Fec system proteins encoded by the 
fecABCDE operon (fec operon) were significantly decreased in an RseP-deficient 
strain. The Fec system is responsible for the uptake of ferric citrate, and the 
transcription of the fec operon is controlled by FecI, an alternative sigma 
factor, and its regulator FecR, a single-pass transmembrane protein. Assays with 
a fec operon expression reporter demonstrated that the proteolytic activity of 
RseP is essential for the ferric citrate-dependent upregulation of the fec 
operon. Analysis using the FecR protein and FecR-derived model proteins showed 
that FecR undergoes sequential processing at the membrane and that RseP 
participates in the last step of this sequential processing to generate the 
N-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of FecR that participates in the transcription 
of the fec operon with FecI. A shortened FecR construct was not dependent on 
RseP for activation, confirming this cleavage step is the essential and 
sufficient role of RseP. Our study unveiled that E. coli RseP performs the 
intramembrane proteolysis of FecR, a novel physiological role that is essential 
for regulating iron uptake by the ferric citrate transport system.

FhuA and FecA are two examples of energy-coupled outer membrane import proteins 
of gram-negative bacteria. FhuA transports iron complexed by the siderophore 
ferrichrome and serves as a receptor for phages, a toxic bacterial peptide, and 
a toxic protein. FecA transports diferric dicitrate and regulates transcription 
of an operon encoding five ferric citrate (Fec) transport genes. Properties of 
FhuA mutants selected according to the FhuA crystal structure are described. 
FhuA mutants in the TonB box, the hatch, and the beta-barrel are rather robust. 
TonB box mutants in FhuA FecA, FepA, Cir, and BtuB are compared; some mutations 
are suppressed by mutations in TonB. Mutant studies have not revealed a 
ferrichrome diffusion pathway, and tolerance to mutations in the region linking 
the TonB box to the hatch does not disclose a mechanism for how energy transfer 
from the cytoplasmic membrane to FhuA changes the conformation of FhuA such that 
bound substrates are released, the pore is opened, and substrates enter the 
periplasm, or how surface loops change their conformation such that 
TonB-dependent phages bind irreversibly and release their DNA into the cells. 
The FhuA and FecA crystal structures do not disclose the mechanism of these 
proteins, but they provide important information for specific functional 
studies. FecA is also a regulatory protein that transduces a signal from the 
cell surface into the cytoplasm. The interacting subdomains of the proteins in 
the FecA --> FecR --> FecI --> RNA polymerase signal transduction pathway 
resulting in fecABCDE transcription have been determined. Energy-coupled 
transporters transport not only iron and vitamin B12, but also other substrates 
of very low abundance such as sugars across the outer membrane; transcription 
regulation of the transport genes may occur similarly to that of the Fec 
transport genes.

Studies of the ferric citrate transport genes in Escherichia coli K-12 have 
revealed a novel type of transcriptional regulation. The inducer, ferric 
citrate, binds to an outer membrane protein and must not be transported into the 
cells to initiate transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes. Rather, a 
signaling cascade from the cell surface across the outer membrane, the 
periplasm, and the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm transmits information 
on the presence of the inducer in the culture medium into the cytoplasm, where 
gene transcription occurs. The outer membrane protein FecA serves as a signal 
receiver and as a signal transmitter across the outer membrane. The FecR protein 
serves as a signal receiver in the periplasm and as a signal transmitter across 
the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, where the FecI sigma factor is 
activated to bind RNA polymerase and specifically initiate transcription of the 
fecABCDE transport genes by binding to the promoter upstream of the fecA gene. 
Transcription of the fecI fecR regulatory genes is repressed by Fe2+ bound to 
the Fur repressor protein. Under iron-limiting conditions, Fur is not loaded 
with Fe2+, the fecI and fecR genes are transcribed, and the FecI and FecR 
proteins are synthesized and respond to the presence of ferric citrate in the 
medium when ferric citrate binds to the FecA protein. Regulation of the fec 
genes represents the paradigm of a growing number of gene regulation systems 
involving transmembrane signaling across three cellular compartments.

Occurrence and regulation of the ferric citrate transport system in Escherichia 
coli B, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Photorhabdus

In Escherichia coli K-12, transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes 
fecABCDE is initiated by binding of diferric dicitrate to the outer membrane 
protein FecA which elicits a signaling cascade from the cell surface to the 
cytoplasm. The FecI sigma factor is only active in the presence of FecR, which 
transfers the signal across the cytoplasmic membrane. In other bacteria, fecIRA 
homologues control iron transport gene transcription by siderophores other than 
citrate. However, in most cases, the FecI homologues are active in the absence 
of the FecR homologues, which might function as anti-sigma factors. Since not 
all E. coli strains contain a fec system, we determined the occurrence of fec 
genes in selected Enterobacteriaceae and the dependence of FecI activity on 
FecR. Incomplete FecIRA systems were chromosomally encoded in Enterobacter 
aerogenes strains and plasmid-encoded in K. pneumoniae. E. coli B, Photorhabdus 
luminescens and one of three Klebsiella pneumoniae strains had a functional 
FecIRA regulatory system as in E. coli K-12. The cytoplasmic N-terminal FecR 
fragments caused constitutive FecI activity in the absence of ferric citrate. 
The PCR-generated mutant FecI(D40G) was inactive and FecI(S15P) was partially 
active. FecR of E. coli K-12 activated FecI of all tested strains except FecI 
encoded on the virulence plasmid pLVPK of K. pneumoniae, which differed from E. 
coli K-12 FecI by having mutations in region 4, which is important for 
interaction with FecR. The C-terminally truncated FecR homologue of pLVPK was 
inactive. pLVPK-encoded FecA contains a 38-residue sequence in front of the 
signal sequence that did not prevent processing and proper integration of FecA 
into the outer membrane of E. coli and lacks the signaling sequence required for 
transcription initiation of the fec transport genes, making it 
induction-incompetent but transport-competent. The evidence indicates that 
fecIRABCDE genes are acquired by horizontal DNA transfer and can undergo 
debilitating mutations.

Transmembrane transcriptional control (surface signalling) of the Escherichia 
coli Fec type.

The ferric citrate transport system of Escherichia coli is the first example of 
a transcription initiation mechanism that starts at the cell surface. The 
inducer, ferric citrate, binds to an outer membrane transport protein, and 
without further transport elicits a signal that is transmitted across the outer 
membrane, the periplasm, and the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm. Signal 
transfer across the three subcellular compartments is mediated by the outer 
membrane transport protein that interacts in the periplasm with a cytoplasmic 
transmembrane protein. The latter is required for activation of a sigma factor 
which belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor family. A similar 
kind of transcription regulation has been demonstrated in Pseudomonas putida, P. 
aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aerobacter aerogenes, 
Bordetella pertussis, B. bronchseptica, B. avium, and Ralstonia solanacearum. 
The genomes of P. putida, P. aeruginosa, Nitrosomonas europaea, Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron and Caulobacter crescentus predict the existence of many more 
such transcriptional regulatory devices.

Transcription of the fecABCDE ferric citrate transport genes of Escherichia coli 
K-12 is initiated by a signaling cascade from the cell surface into the 
cytoplasm. FecR receives the signal in the periplasm from the outer membrane 
protein FecA loaded with ferric citrate, transmits the signal across the 
cytoplasmic membrane, and converts FecI in the cytoplasm to an active sigma 
factor. In this study, it was shown through the use of a bacterial two-hybrid 
system that, in the periplasm, the C-terminal FecR(237-317) fragment interacts 
with the N-terminal FecA(1-79) fragment. In the same C-terminal region, amino 
acid residues important for the interaction of FecR with FecA were identified by 
random and site-directed mutagenesis. They were preferentially located in and 
around a leucine motif (residues 247 to 268) which was found to be highly 
conserved in FecR-like proteins. The degree of residual binding of FecR mutant 
proteins to FecA was correlated with the degree of transcription initiation in 
response to ferric citrate in the culture medium. Three randomly generated 
inactive FecR mutants, FecR(L254E), FecR(L269G), and FecR(F284L), were 
suppressed to different degrees by the mutants FecA(G39R) and FecR(D43E). One 
FecR mutant, FecR (D138E, V197A), induced fecA promoter-directed transcription 
constitutively in the absence of ferric citrate and bound more strongly than 
wild-type FecR to FecA. The data showed that FecR interacts in the periplasm 
with FecA to confer ferric citrate-induced transcription of the fec transport 
genes and identified sites in FecR and FecA that are important for signal 
transduction.

Induction of the ferric citrate transport genes of Escherichia coli K-12 
involves a signalling cascade that starts at the cell surface and proceeds to 
the cytoplasm. Three specific proteins are involved: FecA in the outer membrane, 
FecR in the cytoplasmic membrane, and FecI in the cytoplasm. The binding of 
dinuclear ferric citrate to FecA causes substantial structural changes in FecA, 
triggering the signal cascade. The amino-proximal end of FecA interacts with the 
carboxy-proximal end of FecR in the periplasm. FecR then transmits the signal 
across the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm and activates the FecI sigma 
factor, which binds to the RNA polymerase core enzyme and directs the RNA 
polymerase to the promoter upstream of the fecABCDE transport genes to initiate 
transcription. Transcription of the fecIR regulatory genes and the fec transport 
genes is repressed by the Fur protein loaded with Fe(2+). Therefore, 
transcription of the fec transport genes is subjected to double control: cells 
first detect iron deficiency and respond by synthesis of the regulatory proteins 
FecI and FecR, which initiate transcription of the fec transport genes, provided 
ferric citrate is available. FecI belongs to the extracytoplasmic function sigma 
factors, which are widespread among bacteria. With the recent sequencing of 
complete microbial genomes, it has become apparent that the FecIRA cascade is 
now a paradigm for the regulatory control of FecI family sigmas in Gram-negative 
bacteria.

Quinolinic acid (QA) is a key intermediate of nicotinic acid (Niacin) which is 
an essential human nutrient and widely used in food and pharmaceutical 
industries. In this study, a quinolinic acid producer was constructed by 
employing comprehensive engineering strategies. Firstly, the quinolinic acid 
production was improved by deactivation of NadC (to block the consumption 
pathway), NadR (to eliminate the repression of L-aspartate oxidase and 
quinolinate synthase), and PtsG (to slow the glucose utilization rate and 
achieve a more balanced metabolism, and also to increase the availability of the 
precursor phosphoenolpyruvate). Further modifications to enhance quinolinic acid 
production were investigated by increasing the oxaloacetate pool through 
overproduction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and deactivation of 
acetate-producing pathway enzymes. Moreover, quinolinic acid production was 
accelerated by assembling NadB and NadA as an enzyme complex with the help of 
peptide-peptide interaction peptides RIAD and RIDD, which resulted in up to 
3.7 g/L quinolinic acid being produced from 40 g/L glucose in shake-flask 
cultures. A quinolinic acid producer was constructed in this study, and these 
results lay a foundation for further engineering of microbial cell factories to 
efficiently produce quinolinic acid and subsequently convert this product to 
nicotinic acid for industrial applications.

Murein-metabolizing enzymes from Escherichia coli: sequence analysis and

The complete nucleotide sequence of the slt gene encoding the soluble lytic 
transglycosylase (Slt; EC 3.2.1.-) from Escherichia coli has been determined. 
The largest open reading frame identified on a 2.5-kb PvuII-SalI fragment 
indicates that the enzyme is translated as a preprotein of either 654 or 645 
amino acids, depending on which of two potential start codons is used. The two 
possible translation products differ only in the lengths of their predicted 
signal peptides, 36 or 27 amino acids, respectively. In both cases, processing 
results in a soluble mature protein of 618 amino acids (Mr = 70,468). The 
deduced primary structure of the mature protein was confirmed by N-terminal 
sequencing and determination of the amino acid composition of the isolated 
transglycosylase. The slt gene contains a high percentage of rare codons, 
comparable to other low-expressed genes. A hairpin structure that could serve as 
a transcriptional terminator is located downstream of the slt coding region and 
precedes the trpR open reading frame at 99.7 min on the E. coli chromosomal map. 
A computer-assisted search did not reveal any significant sequence similarity to 
other known carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, including lysozymes. Interestingly, 
a stretch of 151 amino acids at the C terminus of the transglycosylase shows 
similarity to the N-terminal portion of the internal virion protein D from 
bacteriophage T7. Overexpression of the slt gene, under the control of the 
temperature-inducible phage lambda pR promoter, results in a 250-fold 
overproduction of the mature transglycosylase, whereas after deletion of the 
signal peptide a 100-fold overproduction of the enzyme is observed in the 
cytoplasm.

CreBC is a two-component system that controls the expression of a number of 
genes in Escherichia coli (called the cre regulon) that encode diverse 
functions, including intermediary metabolic enzymes. Using a reporter construct, 
we have shown that cre regulon gene expression is activated during growth in 
minimal media when glycolytic carbon sources are being fermented. It also is 
activated during aerobic growth when fermentation products are being used as 
carbon sources. CreB and CreC are essential for the activation of cre regulon 
gene expression, but CreA and CreD, encoded as part of the creABCD gene cluster, 
are not. CreB binds to a TTCACnnnnnnTTCAC direct repeat (the cre tag) in vitro, 
and this sequence, which is associated with cre regulon gene promoters, is 
required for the control of gene expression in vivo. These observations support 
the hypothesis that CreBC is a functional two-component system involved in the 
metabolic control of transcription in E. coli and confirm that CreB is a DNA 
binding transcriptional regulator.

Analysis of the promoter region of the acetate-induced isocitrate lyase gene 
(acuD) of Aspergillus nidulans is described. Transcription start sites were 
detected at positions -163, -170 and approximately -281 upstream of the ATG. 
Transcription analysis showed that the acuD gene is transcribed during growth on 
acetate but not on hexoses or glycerol. Expression of the acuD gene was studied 
under inducing and repressing conditions in cre+, creA, creB and creC mutant 
strains, showing that the creA(d)-1 mutation led to slight derepression of 
isocitrate lyase. Regulation of expression of the acuD gene was also studied 
using an in-frame fusion with the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli. Several 
deletions were made in order to identify the regions responsible for acetate 
induction and repression. A deletion of the -412 to -200 bp upstream region 
resulted in loss of all promoter activity and a smaller deletion within this 
region abolished most of the acetate inducibility.

The CreBC two-component system (TCS) is a conserved regulatory system found in 
Escherichia coli, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas 
maltophilia. In this study, we determined how CreBC TCS regulates secreted 
protease activities and swimming motility using creB, creC, and creBC in-frame 
deletion mutants (KJΔCreB, KJΔCreC, and KJΔBC) of S. maltophilia KJ. Compared to 
wild-type KJ, KJΔCreB had a comparable secreted protease activity; however, the 
secreted protease activities were obviously reduced in KJΔCreC and KJΔBC, 
suggesting that CreC works together with another unidentified response regulator 
(not CreB) to regulate secreted protease activity. Single gene inactivation of 
creB or creC resulted in mutants with an enhanced swimming motility, and this 
phenotype was exacerbated in a double mutant KJΔBC. To elucidate the underlying 
mechanism responsible for the ΔcreBC-mediated swimming enhancement, flagella 
morphology observation, RNA-seq based transcriptome assay, qRT-PCR, and membrane 
integrity and potential assessment were performed. Flagella morphological 
observation ruled out the possibility that swimming enhancement was due to 
altered flagella morphology. CreBC inactivation upregulated the expression of 
creD and flagella-associated genes encoding the basal body- and motor-associated 
proteins. Furthermore, KJΔBC had an increased membrane susceptibility to Triton 
X-100 and CreD upregulation in KJΔBC partially alleviated the compromise of 
membrane integrity. The impact of creBC TCS on bacterial membrane potential was 
assessed by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP50) concentration at 
which 50% of bacterial swimming is inhibited. CCCP50 of wild-type KJ increased 
when creBC was deleted, indicating an association between the higher membrane 
potential of KJΔBC cells and enhanced motility. Upregulation of the basal body- 
and motor-associated genes of flagella in KJΔBC cells may explain the increased 
membrane potential. Collectively, inactivation of creBC increased swimming 
motility through membrane potential increase and creD upregulation in S. 
maltophilia. The increased membrane potential may supply more energy for 
flagella propelling and CreD upregulation supports membrane stability, providing 
a strong membrane for flagellum function.

shown that Lfcin B penetrates the cell membrane and has intracellular 
activities. To elucidate the intracellular behavior of Lfcin B, we first used 
Escherichia coli K12 proteome chips to identify the intracellular targets of 
Lfcin B. The results showed that Lfcin B binds to two response regulators, BasR 
and CreB, of the two-component system. For further analysis, we conducted 
several in vitro and in vivo experiments and utilized bioinformatics methods. 
The electrophoretic mobility shift assays and kinase assays indicate that Lfcin 
B inhibits the phosphorylation of the response regulators (BasR and CreB) and 
their cognate sensor kinases (BasS and CreC). Antibacterial assays showed that 
Lfcin B reduced E. coli's tolerance to environmental stimuli, such as excessive 
ferric ions and minimal medium conditions. This is the first study to show that 
an antimicrobial peptide inhibits the growth of bacteria by influencing the 
phosphorylation of a two-component system directly.

CreBC is a two-component system that controls the expression of a number of 
genes in Escherichia coli (called the cre regulon) that encode diverse 
functions, including intermediary metabolic enzymes. Using a reporter construct, 
we have shown that cre regulon gene expression is activated during growth in 
minimal media when glycolytic carbon sources are being fermented. It also is 
activated during aerobic growth when fermentation products are being used as 
carbon sources. CreB and CreC are essential for the activation of cre regulon 
gene expression, but CreA and CreD, encoded as part of the creABCD gene cluster, 
are not. CreB binds to a TTCACnnnnnnTTCAC direct repeat (the cre tag) in vitro, 
and this sequence, which is associated with cre regulon gene promoters, is 
required for the control of gene expression in vivo. These observations support 
the hypothesis that CreBC is a functional two-component system involved in the 
metabolic control of transcription in E. coli and confirm that CreB is a DNA 
binding transcriptional regulator.

Cyclic AMP-dependent catabolite repression is the dominant control mechanism of 
metabolic fluxes under glucose limitation in Escherichia coli.

Although a whole arsenal of mechanisms are potentially involved in metabolic 
regulation, it is largely uncertain when, under which conditions, and to which 
extent a particular mechanism actually controls network fluxes and thus cellular 
physiology. Based on (13)C flux analysis of Escherichia coli mutants, we 
elucidated the relevance of global transcriptional regulation by ArcA, ArcB, 
Cra, CreB, CreC, Crp, Cya, Fnr, Hns, Mlc, OmpR, and UspA on aerobic glucose 
catabolism in glucose-limited chemostat cultures at a growth rate of 0.1 h(-1). 
The by far most relevant control mechanism was cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent 
catabolite repression as the inducer of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-glyoxylate 
cycle and thus low tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes. While all other mutants and 
the reference E. coli strain exhibited high glyoxylate shunt and PEP 
carboxykinase fluxes, and thus high PEP-glyoxylate cycle flux, this cycle was 
essentially abolished in both the Crp and Cya mutants, which lack the cAMP-cAMP 
receptor protein complex. Most other mutations were phenotypically silent, and 
only the Cra and Hns mutants exhibited slightly altered flux distributions 
through PEP carboxykinase and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, respectively. The 
Cra effect on PEP carboxykinase was probably the consequence of a specific 
control mechanism, while the Hns effect appears to be unspecific. For central 
metabolism, the available data thus suggest that a single transcriptional 
regulation process exerts the dominant control under a given condition and this 
control is highly specific for a single pathway or cycle within the network.

systems from Escherichia coli.

Bacteria possess a signal transduction system, referred to as a two-component 
system, for adaptation to external stimuli. Each two-component system consists 
of a sensor protein-histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR), 
together forming a signal transduction pathway via histidyl-aspartyl 
phospho-relay. A total of 30 sensor HKs, including as yet uncharacterized 
putative HKs (BaeS, BasS, CreC, CusS, HydH, RstB, YedV, and YfhK), and a total 
of 34 RRs, including putative RRs (BaeR, BasR, CreB, CusR, HydG, RstA, YedW, 
YfhA, YgeK, and YhjB), have been suggested to exist in Escherichia coli. We have 
purified the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of 27 sensor HKs and the 
full-length protein of all 34 RRs to apparent homogeneity. Self-phosphorylation 
in vitro was detected for 25 HKs. The rate of self-phosphorylation differed 
among HKs, whereas the level of phosphorylation was generally co-related with 
the phosphorylation rate. However, the phosphorylation level was low for ArcB, 
HydH, NarQ, and NtrB even though the reaction rate was fast, whereas the level 
was high for the slow phosphorylation species BasS, CheA, and CreC. By using the 
phosphorylated HKs, we examined trans-phosphorylation in vitro of RRs for all 
possible combinations. Trans-phosphorylation of presumed cognate RRs by HKs was 
detected, for the first time, for eight pairs, BaeS-BaeR, BasS-BasR, CreC-CreB, 
CusS-CusR, HydH-HydG, RstB-RstA, YedV-YedW, and YfhK-YfhA. All 
trans-phosphorylation took place within less than 1/2 min, but the stability of 
phosphorylated RRs differed, indicating the involvement of de-phosphorylation 
control. In addition to the trans-phosphorylation between the cognate pairs, we 
detected trans-phosphorylation between about 3% of non-cognate HK-RR pairs, 
raising the possibility that the cross-talk in signal transduction takes place 
between two-component systems.

A role for creD, a carbon catabolite repression gene from Aspergillus nidulans, 
in ubiquitination.

5005, Australia.

In Aspergillus nidulans, it is known that creB encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme 
that forms a complex with the WD40 motif containing protein encoded by creC, 
that mutations in these genes lead to altered carbon source utilization and that 
the creD34 mutation suppresses the phenotypic effects of mutations in creC and 
creB. Therefore, creD was characterized in order to dissect the regulatory 
network that involves the CreB-CreC deubiquitination complex. CreD contains 
arrestin domains and PY motifs and is highly similar to the Rod1p and Rog3p 
proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An additional gene was identified in the 
A. nidulans genome that also encodes an arrestin and PY motif-containing 
protein, which we have designated apyA, and thus two similar proteins also exist 
in A. nidulans. In S. cerevisiae, Rod1p and Rog3p interact with the ubiquitin 
ligase Rsp5p, and so the A. nidulans homologue of Rsp5p was identified, and the 
gene encoding this HECT ubiquitin ligase was designated hulA. CreD and ApyA were 
tested for protein-protein interactions with HulA via the bacterial two-hybrid 
system, and ApyA showed strong interaction, and CreD showed weak interaction, 
with HulA in this system.

Regulation of the expression of the isocitrate lyase gene (acuD) of Aspergillus 
nidulans.

Analysis of the promoter region of the acetate-induced isocitrate lyase gene 
(acuD) of Aspergillus nidulans is described. Transcription start sites were 
detected at positions -163, -170 and approximately -281 upstream of the ATG. 
Transcription analysis showed that the acuD gene is transcribed during growth on 
acetate but not on hexoses or glycerol. Expression of the acuD gene was studied 
under inducing and repressing conditions in cre+, creA, creB and creC mutant 
strains, showing that the creA(d)-1 mutation led to slight derepression of 
isocitrate lyase. Regulation of expression of the acuD gene was also studied 
using an in-frame fusion with the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli. Several 
deletions were made in order to identify the regions responsible for acetate 
induction and repression. A deletion of the -412 to -200 bp upstream region 
resulted in loss of all promoter activity and a smaller deletion within this 
region abolished most of the acetate inducibility.

Transcription-generated DNA supercoiling plays a decisive role in a promoter 
relay mechanism for the coordinated expression of genes in the Salmonella 
typhimurium ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster. A similar mechanism also operates 
to control expression of the genes in the Escherichia coli ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD 
gene cluster. However, the mechanism underlying the DNA supercoiling effect 
remained elusive. A bacterial gene silencer AT8 was found to be important for 
the repression state of the leuO gene as part of the promoter relay mechanism. 
In this communication, we demonstrated that the gene silencer AT8 is a 
nucleation site for recruiting histone-like nucleoid structuring protein to form 
a cis-spreading nucleoprotein filament that is responsible for silencing of the 
leuO gene. With a DNA geometric similarity rather than a DNA sequence 
specificity, the E. coli gene silencer EAT6 was capable of replacing the 
histone-like nucleoid structuring protein nucleation function of the S. 
typhimurium gene silencer AT8 for the leuO gene silencing. The 
interchangeability between DNA geometrical elements for supporting the silencing 
activity in the region is consistent with a previous finding that a neighboring 
transcription activity determines the outcome of the gene silencing activity. 
The geometric requirement, which was revealed for this silencing activity, 
explains the decisive role of transcription-generated DNA supercoiling found in 
the promoter relay mechanism.
